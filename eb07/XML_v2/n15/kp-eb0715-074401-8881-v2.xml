                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Navigation</hi> is the art of conducting a ship
                    from one port or place to another.</p>
                <p part="N">HISTORY.</p>
                <p part="N">The profane poets refer the invention of the art of navigation to their
                    heathen deities, though historians ascribe it to theι AEginetes, the
                    Phoenicians, the Tyrians, and the ancient inhabitants of Britain. Scripture
                    refers the origin of so useful an invention to God himself, who gave the first
                    specimen of navigation in the ark built by Noah under his direction.</p>
                <p part="N">However, profane history represents the Phoenicians, especially those of
                    their capital Tyre, as the first navigators; being urged to seek a foreign
                    commerce by the narrowness and poverty of a slip of ground they possessed along
                    the coast, as well as by the convenience of two or three good ports, and by
                    their natural genius for traffic. Accordingly, Lebanon and the other
                    neighbouring mountains furnishing them with excellent wood for ship-building,
                    they in a short time became masters of a numerous fleet; and constantly
                    hazarding new navigations, and settling new trades, they soon arrived at an
                    incredible pitch of opulence and populousness, insomuch as to be in a condition
                    to send out colonies. The principal of these was Carthage, which, keeping up the
                    Phoenician spirit of commerce, in time not only equalled Tyre itself, but vastly
                    surpassed it, sending its merchant fleets through the Straits of Gibraltar,
                    along the western coasts of Africa and Europe, and even, if we may believe some
                    authors, to America itself.</p>
                <p part="N">Tyre, whose immense riches and power are represented in such lofty terms
                    both by sacred and profane authors, was destroyed by Alexander the Great, upon
                    which its navigation and commerce were transferred by the conqueror to
                    Alexandria, a new city, admirably situated for these purposes, and intended to
                    form the capital of the empire of Asia, of which Alexander then meditated the
                    conquest. And thus arose the navigation of the Egyptians, which was afterwards
                    so much cultivated by the Ptolemies, that Tyre and Carthage were quite
                    forgotten.</p>
                <p part="N">Egypt being reduced into a Roman province after the battle of Actium,
                    its trade and navigation fell into the hands of Augustus, in whose time
                    Alexandria was only inferior to Rome; and the magazines of the capital of the
                    world were wholly supplied with merchandize from the commercial capital of
                    Egypt.</p>
                <p part="N">At length Alexandria itself underwent the fate of Tyre and Carthage,
                    being surprised by the Saracens, who, in spite of the Emperor Heraclius,
                    overspread the northern coasts of Africa, whence the merchants being expelled,
                    Alexandria has ever since been in a languishing state, though it still has a
                    considerable share of the commerce of the Christian merchants trading to the
                    Levant.</p>
                <p part="N">The fall of Rome and its empire drew along with it not only the
                    overthrow of learning and the polite arts, butthat of navigation; the
                    barbarians, into whose hands it fell, contenting themselves with the spoils of
                    the industry of their predecessors. But no sooner were the braver amongst those
                    nations well settled in their new provinces, some in Gaul, as the Franks, others
                    in Spain, as the Goths, and others in Italy, as the Lombards, than they began to
                    learn the advantages of navigation and commerce, and the methods of managing
                    them, from the people they had subdued; and this with so much success, that in a
                    little time some of them became able to give new lessons, and set on foot new
                    institutions, for its advantage. Thus it is to the Lombards that we usually
                    ascribe the invention and use of banks, book-keeping, exchanges, rechanges,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p part="N">It does not appear which of the European people, after the settlement of
                    their new masters, first betook themselves to navigation and commerce. Some
                    think it began with the French, although the Italians seem to have the justest
                    title to this distinction, and are accordingly regarded as the restorers of
                    navigation, as well as of the polite arts, which had been banished together from
                    the time the empire was torn asunder. It is the people of Italy, then, and
                    particularly those of Venice and Genoa, who have the glory of this restoration;
                    and it is to their advantageous situation for navigation that they in great
                    measure owe their glory. In the bottom of the Adriatic were a great number of
                    marshy islands, only separated by narrow channels, but these well screened, and
                    almost inaccessible, the residence of some fishermen, who here supported
                    themselves by a little trade in fish and salt, which they found in some of these
                    islands. Thither the Veneti, a people inhabiting that part of Italy which
                    stretches along the coasts of the gulf, retired, when Alaric king of the Goths,
                    and afterwards Attila king of the Huns, ravaged Italy.</p>
                <p part="N">These new islanders, little imagining that this was to be their fixed
                    residence, di∣d not think of composing any body politic; but each of the
                    seventy-two islands of this little archipelago continued a long time under its
                    separate master, and each formed a distinct commonwealth. When their commerce
                    had become considerable enough to occasion jealousy to their neighbours, they
                    began to think of uniting into a body; and it was this union, first begun in the
                    sixth century, but not completed till the eighth, that laid the sure foundation
                    of the future grandeur of the state of Venice. From the time of this union,
                    their fleets of merchantmen were sent to all the ports of the Mediterranean; and
                    at last to those of Egypt, particularly Cairo, a new city, built by the Saracen
                    princes, on the eastern bank of the Nile, where they traded for the spices and
                    other products of the Indies. Thus they flourished, and increased their
                    commerce, their navigation, and their conquests, till the league of Cambray in
                    1508, when a number of jealous princes conspired to bring about their ruin;
                    which was the more easily effected by the diminution of their East India
                    commerce, of which the Portuguese had got one part and the French another.</p>
                <p part="N">Genoa, which had applied itself to navigation at the same time with
                    Venice, and that with equal success, was a long time its dangerous rival,
                    disputed with it the empire of the sea, and shared with it the trade of Egypt
                    and other parts both of the east and west. But jealousy soon began to break out;
                    and the two republics coming to an open rupture, there was almost continual war
                    for three centuries before the superiority was ascertained, when, towards the
                    end of the fourteenth century, the battle of Chioza ended the strife; the
                    Genoese, who till then had usually the advantage, having now lost all, and the
                    Venetians, almost become desperate, having, by one happy blow, beyond all
                    expectation, secured to themselves the empire of the sea, and superiority in
                    commerce.</p>
                <p part="N">About the same time that navigation was retrieved in the southern parts
                    of Europe, a new society of merchants was formed in the north, which not only
                    carried commerce to the greatest perfection of which it was capable till the
                    discovery of the East and West Indies, but also formed a <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193828907?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8907-0746"/>new scheme
                    of laws for its regulation, which still obtain under the name of Uses and
                    Customs of the Sea.</p>
                <p part="N">This society is that famous league of the Hanse Towns, commonly supposed
                    to have been instituted about the year 1164. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Hanse
                        Towns.</hi> For the modern state of navigation in England, Holland, France,
                    Spain, Portugal, &amp;c. see the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Commerce,
                        Company, &amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">We shall only add, that in examining the causes of commerce passing
                    successively from the Venetians, Genoese, and Hanse Towns, to the Portuguese and
                    Spaniards, and from these again to the English and Dutch, it may be established
                    as a maxim, that the relation between commerce and navigation, or their union,
                    is so intimate, that the fall of the one inevitably draws after it that of the
                    other; and that they will always either flourish or decline together. Hence so
                    many laws, ordinances, statutes, and edicts for its regulation; and hence
                    particularly that celebrated act of navigation, which an eminent foreign author
                    calls the <hi rend="italic">palladium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tutelar deity of
                        the commerce of England,</hi> which was long considered as the standing
                    rule, not only of the British amongst themselves, but also as that of other
                    nations with whom they trafficked.</p>
                <p part="N">The art of navigation has been exceedingly improved in modern times,
                    both with regard to the form of the vessels themselves, and also with respect to
                    the methods of working them. The use of rowers is now entirely superseded by the
                    improvements made in the formation of the sails, rigging, &amp;c. by which means
                    ships can not only sail much faster than formerly, but can tack in any direction
                    with the greatest facility. It is also very probable that the ancients were
                    neither so well skilled in finding the latitudes, nor in steering their vessels
                    in places of difficult navigation, as the moderns. But the greatest advantage
                    which the moderns possess over the ancients consists in the ma riner’s compass,
                    by which they are enabled to find their way with more facility in the midst of
                    an immeasurable ocean, than the ancients could have done by creeping along the
                    coast, and never going out of sight of land. Some people indeed contend that
                    this is no new invention, but that the ancients were acquainted with it. They
                    say, that it was impossible for Solomon to have sent ships to Ophir, Tarshish,
                    and Parvaim, which last they imagine to have been Peru, without this useful
                    instrument. They insist, that it was impossible for the ancients to be
                    acquainted with the attractive virtue of the magnet, and to be ignorant of its
                    polarity; nay, they affirm that this property of the magnet is plainly mentioned
                    in the book of Job, where the loadstone is mentioned by the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">topaz,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the stone that turns
                        itself</hi> But it is certain that the Romans who conquered Judaea were
                    ignorant of this instrument; and it is very improbable that such an useful
                    invention, if it had once been commonly known to any nation, would have been
                    forgotten, or perfectly concealed from such a prudent people as the Romans, who
                    were so deeply interested in the discovery of it.</p>
                <p part="N">Amongst those who admit that the mariner’s compass is a modern
                    invention, it has been much disputed who was the inventor. Some attribute the
                    honour of the discovery to Flavio Gioia of Amalfi in Campania,<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">See the articles

                    fourteenth century; whilst others contend that it came from the east, and was
                    earlier known in Europe. But, at whatever time it was invented, it is certain,
                    that the mariner’s compass was not commonly used in navigation before the year
                    1420. In that year the science was considerably improved under the auspices of
                    Henry duke of Visco, brother to the king of Portugal. In the year 1485, Roderick
                    and Joseph, physicians to John II. king of Portugal, together with one Martin de
                    Bohemia, a Portuguese native of the island of Fayal, and scholar of
                    Regiomontanus, calculated tables of the sun’s declination for the use of
                    sailors, and recommended the astrolabe for taking observations at sea. Of the
                    instructions of Martin the celebrated Christopher Columbus is said to have
                    availed himself, and to have improved the Spaniards in the knowledge of the art;
                    for the farther progress of which a lecture was afterwards founded at Seville by
                    the Emperor Charles V.</p>
                <p part="N">The discovery of the variation is claimed both by Columbus and by
                    Sebastian Cabot. The former certainly did observe the variation without having
                    heard of it from any other person, on the 14th of September 1492, and it is very
                    probable that Cabot might have done the same. At that time it was found that
                    there was no variation at the Azores, where some geographers have thought proper
                    to place the first meridian, though it has since been observed that the
                    variation alters in time. The use of the cross staff now began to be introduced
                    amongst sailors. This ancient instrument is described by John Werner of
                    Nuremberg, in his annotations on the first book of Ptolemy’s Geography, printed
                    in the year 1514. He recommends it for observing the distance between the moon
                    and some star, in order thence to determine the longitude.</p>
                <p part="N">At this time the art of navigation was very imperfect, on account of the
                    inaccuracies of the plane chart, which was the only one then known, and which,
                    by its gross errors, must have greatly misled the mariner, especially in voyages
                    far distant from the equator. Its precepts were probably at first only set down
                    on the sea charts, as is the custom at this day; but at length two Spanish
                    treatises were published in the year 1545, one by Pedro de Medina, and the other
                    by Martin Cortes, which contained a complete system of the art, as far as it was
                    then known. These seem to have been the oldest writers who fully handled the
                    art; for Medina, in his dedication to Philip prince of Spain, laments that
                    multitudes of ships daily perished at sea, because there were neither teachers
                    of the art, nor books by which it might be learned; and Cortes, in his
                    dedication, boasts to the emperor, that he was the first who had reduced
                    navigation into a compendium, valuing himself much on what he had performed.
                    Medina defended the plane chart; but he was opposed by Cortes, who showed its
                    errors, and endeavoured to account for the variation of the compass, by
                    supposing the needle to be influenced by a magnetic pole (which he called the
                        <hi rend="italic">point attractive),</hi> different from that of the world,
                    which notion has been farther prosecuted by others. Medina’s book was soon
                    translated into Italian, French, and Flemish, and for a long time served as a
                    guide to foreign navigators. However, Cortes was the favourite author of the
                    English nation, and was translated in the year 1561; whilst Medina’s work was
                    entirely neglected, though translated also within a short time of the other. At
                    that time the system of navigation consisted of an account of the Ptolemaic
                    hypothesis, and the circles of the sphere; of the roundness of the earth, the
                    longitudes, latitudes, climates, &amp;c. and eclipses of the luminaries; a
                    calendar; the method of finding the prime, epact, moon’s age, and tides; a
                    description of the compass, an account of its variation, for the discovering of
                    which Cortes said that an instrument might easily be contrived; tables of the
                    sun’s declination for four years, in order to find the latitude from his
                    meridian altitude; directions to find the same by certain stars; of the course
                    of the sun and moon; the length of the days; of time and its divisions; the
                    method of finding the hour of the day and night; and, lastly, a description of
                    the sea chart, on w hich, in order to discover where the ship was, they made use
                    of a small table, which showed, upon an alteration of one degree of the
                    latitude, how many <pb break="no" facs="nls:193828920?mode=fullsize"

                    the departure from the meridian. Besides, some other instruments were described,
                    especially by Cortes; such as one to find the place and declination of the sun,
                    with the days and place of the moon; certain dials, the astrolabe, and cross
                    staff; together with a complex machine to discover the hour and latitude at
                    once.</p>
                <p part="N">About the same time proposals were made for finding the longitude by
                    observations of the moon. In 1530 Gemma Frisius advised the keeping of time by
                    means of small clocks or watches, which were then, as he says, newly invented.
                    He also contrived a new sort of cross staff, and an instrument called the <hi
                        rend="italic">nautical quadrant,</hi> which last was much praised by William
                    Cunningham, in his Astronomical Glass, printed in the year 1559.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1537, Pedro Nunez, or Nonius, published a book in the
                    Portuguese language, to explain a difficulty in navigation proposed to him by
                    the commander Don Martin Alphonso de Susa. In this he exposed the errors of the
                    plane chart, and likewise gave the solution of several curious astronomical
                    problems, amongst which was that of determining the latitude from two
                    observations of the sun’s altitude and the intermediate azimuth. He observed,
                    that although the rhumbs are spiral lines, yet the direct course of a ship will
                    always be in the arc of a great circle, whereby the angle with the meridians
                    will continually change; and hence all that the steersman can here do for the
                    preserving of the original rhumb, is to correct these deviations as soon as they
                    appear sensible. But in reality the ship will thus describe a course without the
                    rhumb line intended; and therefore his calculations for assigning the latitude,
                    where any rhumb line crosses the several meridians, will be in some measure
                    erroneous. He invented a method of dividing a quadrant by means of concentric
                    circles, which, after having been much improved by Dr Halley, is used at
                    present, and is called a <hi rend="italic">nonius.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1577, Mr William Bourne published a treatise, in which, by
                    considering the irregularities in the moon’s motion, he showed the error of the
                    sailors in finding her age by the epact, and also in ‘determining the hour from
                    observing on what point of the compass the sun and moon appeared. He advised, in
                    sailing towards the high latitudes, to keep the reckoning by the globe, as there
                    the plane chart was most erroneous. He despaired of our ever being able to find
                    the longitude, unless the variation of the compass should be occasioned by some
                    such attractive point as Cortes had imagined, of which, however, he doubted; but
                    as he had shown how to find the variation at all times, he recommended to keep
                    an account of the observations, as useful for finding the place of the ship; and
                    this advice was prosecuted at large by Simon Stevin, in a treatise published at
                    Leyden in 1599, the substance of which was the same year printed at London in
                    English by Mr Edward Wright, entitled the Haven-finding Art. In this ancient
                    tract is also described the method by which our sailors estimate the rate of a
                    ship in her course, by an instrument called the <hi rend="italic">log.</hi> This
                    was so named from the piece of wood or log which floats in the water, whilst the
                    time is reckoned during which the line that is fastened to it is veering out.
                    The author of this contrivance is not known, neither was it taken notice of till
                    1607, in an East India voyage published by Purchas; but from that time it became
                    famous, and was much taken notice of by almost all writers on navigation in
                    every country; and it still continues to be used as at first, although many
                    attempts have been made to improve it, and contrivances proposed to supply its
                    place, many of which have succeeded in quiet water, but proved useless in a
                    stormy sea.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1581 Michael Coignet, a native of Antwerp, published a
                    treatise, in which he animadverted on Medina. In this he showed, that as the
                    rhumbs are spirals, making endless revolutions about the poles, numerous errors
                    must arise from their being represented by straight lines on the sea charts; but
                    although he hoped to find a remedy for these errors, he was of opinion that the
                    proposals of Nonius were scarcely practicable, and therefore in a great measure
                    useless. In treating of the sun’s , declination, he took notice of the gradual
                    decrease in the obliquity of the ecliptic; he also described the cross staff
                    with three transverse pieces, which he admitted were then in common use amongst
                    the sailors. He likewise described some instruments of his own invention; but
                    all of them are now laid aside, excepting perhaps his nocturnal. He constructed
                    a sea table to be used by such as sailed beyond the sixtieth degree of latitude;
                    and at the end of the book is delivered a method of sailing upon a parallel of
                    latitude by means of a ring dial and a twenty-four hour glass. The same year the
                    discovery of the dipping needle was made by Mr Robert Norman. In his publication
                    on that subject he maintains, in opposition to Cortes, that the variation of the
                    compass was caused by some point on the surface of the earth, and not in the
                    heavens; and he also made considerable improvements on the construction of
                    compasses themselves, showing especially the danger of not fixing, on account of
                    the variation, the wire directly under <hi rend="italic">Xhefieur</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">de lis,</hi> as compasses made in different countries have it
                    placed differently. To this performance of Norman’s is prefixed a discourse on
                    the variation of the magnetical needle, by Mr William Burrough, in which he
                    shows how to determine the variation in many different ways, and also points out
                    many errors in the practice of navigation at that time, speaking in very severe
                    terms concerning those who had published upon it.</p>
                <p part="N">During this time the Spaniards continued to publish treatises on the
                    art. In 1585 an excellent compendium was published by Roderico Zamorano, and
                    contributed greatly towards the improvement of the art, particularly in the sea
                    charts. Globes of an improved kind, and of a much larger size than those
                    formerly used, were now constructed, and many improvements were made in other
                    instruments; nevertheless, the plane chart continued still to be followed,
                    though its errors were frequently complained of. Methods of removing these
                    errors had indeed been sought after; and Gerard Mercator seems to have been the
                    first who found the true method of effecting this, so as to answer the purposes
                    of seamen. His method was to represent the parallels, both of latitude and
                    longitude, by parallel straight lines, but gradually to augment the former as
                    they approached the pole. Thus the rhumbs, which otherwise ought to have been
                    curves, were now also extended into straight lines; and thus a straight line
                    drawn between any two places marked upon the chart formed an angle with the
                    meridians, expressing the rhumb leading from the one to the other. But although
                    in 1569 Mercator published an universal map constructed in this manner, it does
                    not appear that he was acquainted with the principles upon which this proceeded;
                    and it is now generally believed, that the true principles on which the
                    construction of what is called <hi rend="italic">Mercators chart</hi> depends
                    were first discovered by an Englishman, Mr Edward Wright.</p>
                <p part="N">Mr Wright supposed, but, according to the general opinion, without
                    sufficient grounds, that this enlargement of the degrees of latitude was known
                    and mentioned by Ptolemy, and that the same thing had also been spoken of by
                    Cortes. The expressions of Ptolemy alluded to relate indeed to the proportion
                    between the distances of the parallels and meridians; but instead of proposing
                    any gradual enlargement of the parallels of latitude in a general chart, he
                    speaks only of particular maps, and advises not to confine a system of such maps
                    to one and the same scale, but to plan them out by a different measure, as
                    occasion might require; with this precaution, however, that the degrees of <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193828933?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8933-0748"
                    />longitude in each should bear some proportion to those of latitude, and this
                    proportion was to be deduced from that which the magnitude of the respective
                    parallels bore to a great circle of the sphere. He added, that, in particular
                    maps, if this proportion be observed with regard to the middle parallel, the
                    inconvenience will not be great, although the meridians should be straight lines
                    parallel to each other. But here he is understood only to mean, that the maps
                    should in some measure represent the figures of the countries for which they are
                    drawn. In this sense Mercator, who drew maps for Ptolemy’s tables, understood
                    him; thinking it, however, an improvement not to regulate the meridians by one
                    parallel, but by two, one distant from the northern, the other from the southern
                    extremity of the map, by a fourth part of the whole depth; by which means, in
                    his maps, although the meridians are straight lines, yet they are generally
                    drawn inclining to each other towards the poles. With regard to Cortes, he
                    speaks only of the number of degrees of latitude, and not of the extent of them;
                    nay, he gives express directions that they should all be laid down by equal
                    measurement in a scale of leagues adapted to the map.</p>
                <p part="N">For some time after the appearance of Mercator’s map, it was not rightly
                    understood, and it was even thought to be entirely useless, if not detrimental.
                    However, about the year 1592 its utility began to be perceived; and seven years
                    afterwards, Mr Wright printed his famous treatise entitled the Correction of
                    certain Errors in Navigation, where he fully explained the reason of extending
                    the length of the parallels of latitude, and the uses thereof to navigators. In
                    1610 a second edition of Mr Wright’s book was published, with improvements. <hi
                        rend="italic">An</hi> excellent method was proposed of determining the
                    magnitude of the earth; and at the same time it was judiciously proposed to make
                    our common measures in some proportion to a degree on its surface, that they
                    might not depend on the uncertain length of a barleycorn. Amongst his other
                    improvements may be mentioned the Table of Latitudes for Dividing the Meridian
                    computed to Minutes, whereas it had been only divided to every tenth minute. He
                    also published a description of an instrument which he calls the <hi
                        rend="italic">tea rings,</hi> by which the variation of the compass, the
                    altitude of the sun, and the time of the day, may at once readily be determined
                    in any place, provided the latitude is known. He also showed how to correct the
                    errors arising from the eccentricity of the eye in observing by the cross staff.
                    In the years 1594, 1595, 1596, and 1597, he amended the tables of the
                    declinations and places of the sun and stars from his own observations made with
                    a six-feet quadrant, a sea quadrant to take altitudes by a forward or backward
                    observation, and likewise with a contrivance for the ready finding of the
                    latitude by the height of the pole star, when not upon the meridian. To this
                    edition was subjoined a translation of Zamorano’s Compendium, above mentioned,
                    in which he corrected some mistakes in the original; adding a large table of the
                    variation of the compass observed in different parts of the world, in order to
                    show that it was not occasioned by any magnetical pole.</p>
                <p part="N">These improvements soon became known abroad. In 1608 a treatise entitled
                        <hi rend="italic">Hypomnemata Mathematica</hi> was published by Simon
                    Stevin, for the use of Prince Maurice. In the portion of the work relating to
                    navigation, the author having treated of sailing on a great circle, and shown
                    how to draw the rhumbs on a globe mechanically, set down Wright’s two tables of
                    latitudes and of rhumbs, in order to describe these lines more accurately,
                    pretending even to have discovered an error in Wright’s table. But all Stevin’s
                    objections were fully answered by the author himself, who showed that they arose
                    from the rude method of calculating made use of by the former.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1624 the learned Wellebrordus Snellius, professor of the mathematics
                    at Leyden, published a treatise of navigation on Wright’s plan, but somewhat
                    obscurely; and as he did not particularly mention all the discoveries of Wright,
                    the latter was thought by some to have taken the hint of all his discoveries
                    from Snellius. But this supposition has been long ago refuted; and Wright now
                    enjoys the honour of those discoveries, which is justly his due.</p>
                <p part="N">Mr Wright having shown how to find the place of the ship upon his chart,
                    observed that the same might be performed more accurately by calculation; but
                    considering, as he says, that the latitudes, and especially the courses at sea,
                    could not be determined so precisely, he forbore setting down particular
                    examples, as the mariner may be allowed to save himself this trouble, and only
                    to mark out upon his chart the ship’s way, after the manner then usually
                    practised. However, in 1614, Mr Raphe Handson, amongst the nautical questions he
                    subjoined to a translation of Pitiscus’s Trigonometry, solved very distinctly
                    every case of navigation, by applying arithmetical calculations to Wright’s
                    Table of Latitudes, or of Meridional Parts, as it has since been called.
                    Although the method discovered by Wright for finding the change of longitude by
                    a ship sailing on a rhumb is the proper way of performing it, Handson also
                    proposes two methods of approximation without the assistance of Wright’s
                    division of the meridian line. The first was computed by the arithmetical mean
                    between the cosines of both latitudes; and the other by the same mean between
                    the secants as an alternative, when Wright’s book was not at hand; although this
                    latter is wider of the truth than the former. By the same calculations also he
                    showed how much each of these compendiums deviates from the truth, and also how
                    widely the computations on the erroneous principles of the plane chart differ
                    from them all. The method generally used by our sailors, however, is commonly
                    called the <hi rend="italic">middle latitude,</hi> which, although it errs more
                    than that by the arithmetical mean between the two cosines, is preferred on
                    account of its being less operose; yet in high latitudes it is more eligible to
                    use that of the arithmetical mean between the logarithmic cosines, equivalent to
                    the geometrical mean between the cosines themselves; a method since proposed by
                    Mr John Bassat. The computation by the middle latitude will always fall short of
                    the true change of longitude, that by the geometrical mean will always exceed;
                    but that by the arithmetical mean falls short in latitudes of about 45 degrees,
                    and exceeds in lesser latitudes. However, none of these methods will differ much
                    from the truth when the change of latitude is sufficiently small.</p>
                <p part="N">About this period logarithms were invented by John Napier, baron of
                    Merchiston in Scotland, and proved of the utmost service to the art of
                    navigation. From these Mr Edmund Gunter constructed a table of logarithmic sines
                    and tangents to every minute of the quadrant, which he published in 1620. In
                    this work he applied to navigation, and other branches of mathematics, his
                    admirable ruler known by the name of Gunter’s scale,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">See Gunter’s Scale.</p></note>
                    on which are described lines of logarithms, of logarithmic sines and tangents,
                    of meridional parts, &amp;c.; and he greatly improved the sector for the same
                    purposes. He also showed how to take a back observation by the cross staff, by
                    which the error arising from the eccentricity of the eye is avoided. He likewise
                    described another instrument, of his own invention, called the <hi rend="italic"
                        >cross bow,</hi> for taking altitudes of the sun or stars, with some
                    contrivances for the more readily collecting the latitude from the observation.
                    The discoveries concerning logarithms were carried into France in <pb break="no"

                    Edmund Wingate, who published two small tracts in that year at Paris. In one of
                    these he taught the use of Gunter’s scale; and in the other, that of the tables
                    of artificial sines and tangents, as modelled according to Napier’s last form,
                    erroneously attributed by Wingate to Briggs.</p>
                <p part="N">Gunter’s rule was projected into a circular arch by the Reverend Mr
                    William Oughtred in 1633, and its uses were fully shown in a pamphlet entitled
                    the Circles of Proportion, where, in an appendix, several important points in
                    navigation are well treated. It has also been made in the form of a sliding
                    ruler.</p>
                <p part="N">The logarithmic tables were first applied to the different cases of
                    sailing by Mr Thomas Addison, in his treatise entitled Arithmetical Navigation,
                    printed in the year 1625. He also gave two traverse tables, with their uses; the
                    one to quarter· points of the compass, and the other to degrees. Mr Henry
                    Gellibrand published his discovery of the changes of the variation of the
                    compass, in a small quarto pamphlet, entitled a Discourse Mathematical on the
                    Variation of the Magnetical Needle, printed in 1635. This extraordinary
                    phenomenon he found out by comparing the observations which had been made at
                    different times near the same place by Mr Burrough, Mr Gunter, and himself, all
                    persons of great skill and experience in these matters. This discovery was
                    likewise soon known abroad; for Athanasius Kircher, in his treatise entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Magnes,</hi> first printed at Rome in the year 1641, informs
                    us, that he had been told of it by Mr John Greaves, and then gives a letter of
                    the famous Marinus Mersennus, containing a very distinct account of the
                    same.</p>
                <p part="N">As altitudes of the sun are taken on shipboard by observing his
                    elevation above the visible horizon, to obtain from these the sun’s true
                    altitude with correctness, Wright observed it to be necessary that the dip of
                    the visible horizon below the horizontal plane passing through the observer’s
                    eye should be brought into the account, which cannot be calculated without
                    knowing the magnitude of the earth. Hence he was induced to propose different
                    methods for finding this; but he complains that the most effectual was out of
                    his power to execute, and therefore he contented himself with a rude attempt, in
                    some measure sufficient for his purpose. The dimensions of the earth deduced by
                    him corresponded very well with the usual divisions of the log line;
                    nevertheless, as he wrote not an express treatise on navigation, but only for
                    the correcting such errors as prevailed in general practice, the log line did
                    not fall under his notice. Mr Richard Norwood, however, put in execution the
                    method recommended by Mr Wright as the most perfect for measuring the dimensions
                    of the earth, with the true length of the degrees of a great circle upon it;
                    and, in 1635, he actually measured the distance between London and York; from
                    which measurement, and the summer solstitial altitudes of the sun observed on
                    the meridian at both places, he found a degree on a great circle of the earth to
                    contain 367,196 English feet, equal to 57,300 French fathoms or toises, which is
                    very exact, as appears from many measurements that have been made since that
                    time. Of all this Mr Norwood gave a full account in his treatise called the
                    Seaman’s Practice, published in 1637. He there showed the reason why Snellius
                    had failed in his attempt; and he also pointed out various uses of his
                    discovery, particularly for correcting the gross errors hitherto committed in
                    the divisions of the log line. But necessary amendments have been little
                    attended to by sailors, whose obstinacy in adhering to established errors has
                    been complained of by the best writers on navigation. This improvement, however,
                    has at length made its way into practice, and few navigators of reputation now
                    make use of the old measure of forty-two feet to a knot. In this treatise Mr
                    Norwood also describes his own excellent method of setting down and perfecting a
                    sea reckoning, by using a traverse table, which method he had followed and
                    taught for many years. He likewise shows how to rectify the course by the
                    variation of the compass being considered; as also how to discover currents, and
                    to make proper allowance on their account. This treatise, and another on
                    trigonometry, were continually reprinted, as the principal books for learning
                    scientifically the art of navigation. What he had delivered, especially in the
                    latter of them, concerning this subject, was abridged as a manual for sailors,
                    in a very small piece called an Epitome, which useful performance has gone
                    through a great number of editions. No alterations were ever made in the
                    Seaman’s Practice till the twelfth edition in 1676, when the following paragraph
                    was inserted in a smaller character: “About the year 1672, Monsieur Picart has
                    published an account in French, concerning the measure of the earth, a breviate
                    whereof may be seen in the Philosophical Transactions, No. 112, wherein he
                    concludes one degree to contain 365,184 English feet, nearly agreeing with Mr
                    Norwood’s experiment ;” and this advertisement is continued through the
                    subsequent editions as late as the year 1732.</p>
                <p part="N">About the year 1645 Mr Bond published in Norwood's Epitome a very great
                    improvement of Wright’s method, from a property in his meridian line, whereby
                    the divisions are more scientifically assigned than the author himself was able
                    to effect; it resulted from this theorem, that these divisions are analogous to
                    the excesses of the logarithmic tangents of half the respective latitudes
                    augmented by forty-five degrees above the logarithm of the radius. This he
                    afterwards explained more fully in the third edition of Gunter’s works, printed
                    in 1653, where he observed that the logarithmic tangents from 45° upwards
                    increase in the same manner as the secants do added together, if every half
                    degree be accounted as a whole degree of Mercator’s meridional line. His rule
                    for computing the meridional parts belonging to any two latitudes, supposed to
                    be on the same side of the equator, is to the following effect: “Take the
                    logarithmic tangent, rejecting the radius, of half each latitude, augmented by
                    forty-five degrees; divide the difference of those numbers by the logarithmic
                    tangent of 45° 30', the radius being likewise rejected, and the quotient will be
                    the meridional parts required, expressed in degrees.” This rule is the immediate
                    consequence of the general theorem, that the degrees of latitude bear to one
                    degree (or sixty minutes, which in Wright’s table stands for the meridional
                    parts of one degree), the same proportion as the logarithmic tangent of half any
                    latitude augmented by forty-five degrees, and the radius neglected, to the like
                    tangent of half a degree augmented by forty-five degrees, with the radius
                    likewise rejected. But here there was still wanting the demonstration of this
                    general theorem, which was at length supplied by Mr James Gregory of Aberdeen,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Exercitationes</hi><hi rend="italic">Geometricae,</hi>
                    printed at London in 1668; and afterwards more concisely demonstrated, together
                    with a scientific determination of the divisor, by Dr Halley, in the
                    Philosophical Transactions for 1695 (No. 219), from the consideration of the
                    spirals into which the rhumbs are transformed in the stereographic projection of
                    the sphere upon the plane of the equinoctial, and which is rendered still more
                    simple by Mr Roger Cotes, in his <hi rend="italic">Logornetria,</hi> first
                    published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1714 (No. 388). It is moreover
                    added in Gunter’s book, that if ^th of this division, which does not sensibly
                    differ from the logarithmic tangent of 45° P 30", with the radius subtracted
                    from it, be used, the quotient will exhibit the meridional parts expressed in
                    leagues, and this is the divisor set down in Norwood’s Epitome. After the same
                    manner the meridional parts will be found in minutes, if the like logarithmic
                    tangent of 45° 1' 30'', diminished by the radius, be <pb break="no"

                    is, the number used by others being 12633, when the logarithmic tables consist
                    of eight places of figures besides the index.</p>
                <p part="N">In an edition of a book called the Seaman’s Kalendar, Mr Bond declared
                    that he had discovered the longitude by having found out the true theory of the
                    magnetic variation; and to gain credit to his assertion, he foretold, that at
                    London in 1657 there would be no variation of the compass, and from that time it
                    would gradually increase the other way; which happened accordingly. Again, in
                    the Philosophical Transactions for 1668 (No. 40), he published a table of the
                    variation for forty-nine years to come. Thus he acquired such reputation, that
                    his treatise entitled The Longitude Found, was in the year 1676 published by the
                    special command of Charles II. and approved by many celebrated mathematicians.
                    It was not long, however, before it met with opposition; and in the year 1678,
                    another treatise, entitled The Longitude not Found, made its appearance, and as
                    Mr Bond’s hypothesis did not in any manner answer its author’s sanguine
                    expectations, the affair was undertaken by Dr Halley. The result of his
                    speculation was, that the magnetic needle is influenced by four poles; but this
                    wonderful phenomenon seems hitherto to have eluded all our researches. (See <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Magnetism.)</hi> In 1700, however, Dr Halley published a
                    general map, with curve lines expressing the paths where the magnetic needle had
                    the same variation; which was received with universal applause. But as the
                    positions of these curves vary from time to time, they should frequently be
                    corrected by skilful persons, as was done in 1644 and 1756, by Mr William
                    Mountaine, and Mr James Dodson. In the Philosophical Transactions for 1690, Dr
                    Halley also gave a dissertation on the monsoons, containing many very useful
                    observations for such as sail to places subject to these winds.</p>
                <p part="N">After the true principles of the art were settledby Wright, Bond, and
                    Norwood, the authors who wrote on navigation became so numerous that it would be
                    impossible to enumerate them. New improvements were daily made, and every thing
                    relative to it was settled with an accuracy not only unknown to former ages, but
                    which would have been reckoned utterly impossible. The earth being found to be a
                    spheroid, and not a perfect sphere, with the shortest diameter passing through
                    the poles, a tract was published in 1741 by the Reverend Doctor Patrick Murdoch,
                    wherein he accommodated Wright’s sailing to such a figure; and the same year Mr
                    Colin Maclaurin, in the Philosophical Transactions (No. 461), gave a rule for
                    determining the meridional parts of a spheroid; which spe-. culation is farther
                    treated of in his book of Fluxions,, printed at Edinburgh in 1742, and in
                    Delambre’s Astronomy (t. iii. ch. xxxvi.).</p>
                <p part="N">Amongst the later discoveries in navigation, that of finding the
                    longitude both by lunar observations and by timekeepers is the principal. It is
                    owing chiefly to the rewards offered by the British parliament that this has
                    attained the present degree of perfection. We are indebted to Dr Maskelyne for
                    putting the first of these methods in practice, and for other important
                    improvements in navigation. The time-keepers constructed by Harrison for this
                    express purpose were found to answer so well that he obtained the parliamentary
                    reward. These have been improved by Arnold, Earnshaw, and many others, so as now
                    to be almost in common use.</p>
                <p part="N">The works which have latterly appeared on navigation are those on the
                    longitude and navigation by Dr Mackay, Dr Inman, Mr Riddle, Mr Norie, and
                    others, and which contain every necessary requisite to form the practical
                    navigator.</p>
                <p part="N">THEORY OF NAVIGATION.</p>
                <p part="N">The motion of a ship in the water is well known to depend on the action
                    of the wind upon its sails, regulated by the direction of the helm. As the water
                    is a resisting medium, and the bulk of the ship very considerable, it thence
                    follows that there is always a great resistance on her forepart; and when this
                    resistance becomes sufficient to balance the moving force of the wind upon the
                    sails, the ship attains her utmost degree of velocity, and her motion is no
                    longer accelerated. This velocity is different according to the different
                    strength of the wind; but the stronger the wind, the greater resistance is made
                    to the ship’s passage through the water; and hence, although the wind should
                    blow ever so strongly, there is also a limit to the velocity of the ship, for
                    the sails and ropes can bear but a certain force of air; and when the resistance
                    on the fore-part becomes more than equivalent to their strength, the velocity
                    can no longer be increased, and the rigging gives way.</p>
                <p part="N">The direction of a ship’s motion depends upon the position of her sails
                    with regard to the wind, combined with the action of the rudder. The most
                    natural direction of the ship is, when she runs directly before the wind, the
                    sails being then disposed so as to be at right angles thereto. But this is not
                    always the case, both on account of the variable nature of the winds, and the
                    situation of the intended port, or of intermediate headlands or islands. When
                    the wind, therefore, happens not to be favourable, the sails are placed so as to
                    make an oblique angle both with the direction of the ship and with the wind; and
                    the sails, together with the rudder, must be managed in such a manner that the
                    direction of the ship may make an acute angle with that of the wind; and the
                    ship, making boards on different tacks, will by this means arrive at the
                    intended port.</p>
                <p part="N">The reason of the ship’s motion in this case is, that the water resists
                    the side more than the fore-part, and that in the same proportion as her length
                    exceeds her breadth. This proportion is so considerable, that the ship
                    continually flies off where the resistance is least, and that sometimes with
                    great swiftness. In this way of sailing, however, there is a great limitation;
                    for if the angle made by the keel with the direction of the wind be too acute,
                    the ship cannot be kept in that position; neither is it possible for a large
                    ship to make a more acute angle with the wind than about six points, though
                    small sloops, it is said, may make an angle of about five points with it or
                    less. In all these cases, however, the velocity of the ship is greatly retarded,
                    and that not only on account of the obliquity of her motion, but by reason of
                    what is called her <hi rend="italic">lee-way.</hi> This is occasioned by the
                    yielding of the water on the lee-side of the ship, by which means the vessel
                    acquires a compound motion, partly in the direction of the wind, and partly in
                    that which is necessary for attaining the desired port.</p>
                <p part="N">It is perhaps impossible to lay down any mathematical principles on
                    which the lee-way of a ship could be properly calculated; only we may observe in
                    general that it depends on the strength of the wind, the roughness of the sea,
                    and the velocity of the ship. When the wind is not very strong, the resistance
                    of the water on the lee-side bears a very great proportion to that of the
                    current of air, and therefore it will yield but very little; however, supposing
                    the ship to remain in the same place, it is evident, that the water having once
                    begun to yield, will continue to do so for some time, even though no additional
                    force were applied to it; but as the wind continually applies the same force as
                    at first, the lee-way of the ship must go on constantly increasing till the
                    resistance of the water upon the lee-side balances the force applied on the
                    other, when it will become uniform, as does the motion of a ship sailing <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193828972?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8972-0751"/>
                    before the wind. If the ship change her place with any degree of velocity, then
                    every time she moves her own length, a new quantity of water is to be put in
                    motion, which has not yet received any momentum, and which of consequence will
                    make a greater resistance than it can do when the ship remains in the same
                    place. In proportion to the swiftness of the ship, then, the lee-way will be the
                    less; but if the wind be very strong, the velocity of the ship will bear but a
                    small proportion to that of the current of air, and the same effects must follow
                    as though the ship moved slowly and the wind was gentle, that is, the ship must
                    make a great deal of lee-way. The same thing happens when the sea rises high,
                    whether the wind be strong or not; for then the whole water of the ocean, as far
                    as the swell reaches, has acquired a motion in a certain direction, and that to
                    a very considerable depth. The mountainous waves will not fail to carry the ship
                    very much out of her course; and this deviation will certainly be according to
                    their velocity and their magnitude. In all cases of a rough sea, therefore, a
                    great deal oflee-wayismade. Another circumstance also occasions a variation in
                    the quantity of the lee-way, namely, the lightness or heaviness of the ship; it
                    being evident, that when the ship sinks deep in the water, a much greater
                    quantity of that element is to be put in motion before she can make any lee-way,
                    than when she swims on the surface. As, therefore, it is impossible to calculate
                    all these things with mathematical exactness, it is plain that the real course
                    of a ship is exceedingly difficult to be found, and frequent errors must occur,
                    which can only be corrected by means of celestial observations.</p>
                <p part="N">In many places of the ocean there are <hi rend="italic">currents,</hi>
                    or places where the water, instead of remaining at rest, runs with a very
                    considerable velocity for a considerable way in some particular direction, and
                    which will certainly carry the ship greatly out of her course. This occasions an
                    error of the same nature with the lee-way; and therefore, whenever a current is
                    perceived, its direction and velocity ought to be determined, and the proper
                    allowances made.</p>
                <p part="N">Another source of error in reckoning the course of a ship proceeds from
                    the variation of the compass. There are few parts of the world where the needle
                    points exactly north.; and in those where the variation is known, it is subject
                    to very considerable alterations. By these means the course of the ship is
                    mistaken; for as the sailors have no other standard to direct them than the
                    compass, if the needle, instead of pointing due north, should point northeast, a
                    prodigious error would be occasioned during the course of the voyage, and the
                    ship would not come near the port to which she was bound. To avoid errors of
                    this kind, the only method is to observe the sun’s amplitude and azimuth as
                    frequently as possible, by which the variation of the compass will be perceived,
                    and the proper allowances can then be made for errors in the course which this
                    may have occasioned.</p>
                <p part="N">Errors will arise in the reckoning of a ship, especially when she sails
                    in high latitudes, from the spheroidal figure of the earth; for as the polar
                    diameter of our globe is found to be considerably shorter than the equatorial
                    one, it thence follows, that the farther we remove from the equator, the longer
                    are the degrees of latitude. Of consequence, if a navigator assigns any certain
                    number of miles for the length of a degree of latitude near the equator, he must
                    vary that measure as he approaches towards the poles, otherwise he will imagine
                    that he has not sailed so far as he has actually done. It would therefore be
                    necessary to have a table containing the length of a degree of latitude in every
                    different parallel from the equator to either pole; as, without this, a
                    troublesome calculation must be made at every time the navigator makes a
                    reckoning of his course. Such a table, however, has not yet appeared; neither
                    indeed does it seem to be an easy matter to make it, on account of the
                    difficulty of measuring the length even of one or two degrees of latitude in
                    different parts of the world. Sir Isaac Newton first discovered this spheroidal
                    figure of the earth; and showed, from theory originally suggested by experiments
                    on pendulums, that the polar diameter was to the equatorial one as 229 to 230.
                    This proportion, however, has not been admitted by succeeding calculators. The
                    French mathematicians, who measured a degree of the meridian in Lapland, made
                    the proportion between the equatorial and polar diameters to be as 1 to 0∙9891;
                    those who measured a degree at Quito in Peru made the proportion as 1 to
                    0∙99624&lt;, or 266 to 265; Μ. ßouguer makes the proportion to be as 179 to 178;
                    and Μ. Buffon, in one part of his theory of the earth, makes the equatorial
                    diameter exceed the polar one by γ⅛-th of the whole. According to Μ. du Séjour,
                    this proportion is as 321 to 320; and Μ. de Laplace, in his Memoir upon the
                    Figure of Spheroids, has deduced the same proportion. Later investigations,
                    however, show that the polar axis is to the equatorial diameter in the ratio of
                    300 to 301 nearly. From these variations, it appears that the point is not
                    exactly determined, and, consequently, that any corrections which can be made
                    with regard to the spheroidal figure of the earth must be very uncertain.</p>
                <p part="N">It is of consequence to navigators, in a long voyage, to take the
                    nearest way to their port; but this is scarcely possible to be done. The
                    shortest distance between any two points on the surface of a sphere is measured
                    by an arc of a great circle intercepted between them; and therefore it is
                    advisable to direct the ship along a great circle of the earth’s surface. But
                    this is a matter of considerable difficulty, because there are no fixed marks by
                    which it can be readily known whether the ship sails in the direction of a great
                    circle or not. For this reason the sailors commonly choose to direct their
                    course by the rhumbs, or the bearing of the place by the compass. These bearings
                    do not point out the shortest distance between places; because, upon a globe,
                    the rhumbs are spirals, and not arcs of great circles. However, when the places
                    lie directly under the equator, or exactly under the same meridian, the rhumb
                    then coincides with the arc of a great circle, and of consequence shows the
                    nearest way. The sailing on the arc of a great circle is called <hi
                        rend="italic">great circle sailing</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the
                    cases of it depend all upon the solution of problems in spherical
                    trigonometry.</p>
                <p part="N">MARINER’S COMPASS.</p>
                <p part="N">A ship is enabled to keep her course at sea by means of an instrument
                    called the mariner’s compass. It consists of a magnetic steel bar attached to
                    the under side of a card divided into points and quarter points, and supported
                    by a fine pin, on which it turns freely within a box covered with glass. By
                    reason of the directive property of the magnet, the north point, which is
                    commonly denoted by a <hi rend="italic">fleur de lis,</hi> is readily known. The
                    circumference of the card is generally divided into thirty-two points, which in
                    the best compasses are again subdivided into half points and quarters. These are
                    reckoned sufficient for nautical purposes. On the inside of the box is drawn a
                    dark vertical line called lubber’s point. This point, or rather line, and the
                    pin on which the card turns, are in the same line or plane with the keel of the
                    ship; and hence the point on the circumference of the card opposite to lubber’s
                    point shows the angle which the ship’s course makes with the magnetic meridian,
                    called the course of the ship.</p>

                <p part="N">The annexed diagram gives a general view of the com pass. The names of
                    the points, and the angles which they form with the meridian, are given in Table
                    I. at the end of this article, and, as thus described, the instrument is called
                    the steering compass.</p>
                <p part="N">The azimuth compass is the same instrument more nicely made. The
                    circumference of the card isdivided into degrees and parts by a vernier, and is
                    fitted up with sight-vanes to take amplitudes and azimuths, for the purpose of
                    determining the variation of the compass by observation. The variation is then
                    applied to the magnetic course shown by the steering compass, whence the true
                    course with respect to the meridian becomes known. The necessary rules for this
                    purpose will be given in a succeeding part of this article.</p>
                <p part="N">Besides the variation, the needle is also affected by the dip, which is
                    likewise fully explained in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Magnetism,</hi> as
                    well as Mr Barlow’s method of correcting the effects of local attraction,
                    arising from the effects of the iron, guns, &amp;c. in the vessel itself. Having
                    made these preliminary observations, we shall now proceed to the</p>

                <p part="N">The art of navigation depends upon astronomical and mathematical
                    principles. The places of the sun, moon, planets, and fixed stars, are deduced
                    from observation and calculation, and arranged in tables, the use of which is
                    absolutely necessary in reducing observations taken at sea for the purpose of
                    ascertaining the latitude and longitude of the ship, and the variation of the
                    compass. The problems in the various sailings are resolved either by
                    trigonometrical calculation, or by tables or rules formed by the assistance of
                    trigonometry. By mathematics, the necessary tables are constructed, and rules
                    investigated for performing the more difficult parts of navigation. For these
                    several branches of science, and for logarithmic tables, the reader is referred
                    to the respective articles in this work. A few tables are given at the end of
                    this article; but as the other tables necessary for the practice of navigation
                    are to be found in almost every treatise on that subject, it seems unnecessary
                    to insert them in this place.</p>

                <p part="N">The situation of a place on the surface of the earth is estimated by its
                    distance from two imaginary lines intersecting each other at right angles. The
                    one of these is called the <hi rend="italic">equator,</hi> and the other the <hi
                        rend="italic">first meridian.</hi> The situation of the equator is fixed;
                    but that of the first meridian is arbitrary, and therefore different nations
                    assume different first meridians. In Great Britain, we esteem that to be the
                    first meridian which passes through the Royal ' Observatory at Greenwich.</p>
                <p part="N">The equator divides the earth into two equal parts, called the <hi
                        rend="italic">northern</hi> and <hi rend="italic">southern
                        hemispheres</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the latitude of a place is its
                    distance from the equator, reckoned on a meridian in degrees and parts of a
                    degree, being either north and south, according as it is in the northern or
                    southern hemisphere.</p>
                <p part="N">The first meridian being continued round the globe, divides it into two

                    the meridian of the given place, and is either east or west, according as it is
                    in the eastern or western hemisphere respectively to the first meridian.</p>

                <p part="N">The theory of the tides has already been explained under the article <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Astronomy,</hi> and will again be further illustrated under

                    only to explain the method of calculating the time of high water at a given
                    place.</p>
                <p part="N">As the tides depend upon the joint actions of the sun and moon, and
                    therefore upon the distance of these objects from the earth and from each other;
                    and as, in the method generally employed to find the time of high water, whether
                    by the mean time of new moon, or by the epacts, or tables deduced therefrom, the
                    moon is supposed to be the sole agent, and to have an uniform motion in the
                    periphery of a circle, whose centre is that of the earth; it is hence obvious
                    that this method cannot be accurate, and by observation the error is sometimes
                    found to exceed two hours. This method is therefore rejected, and another given,
                    in which the error will seldom exceed a few minutes, unless the tides are
                    greatly influenced by the winds.</p>

                    by taking the corrections for the moon’s horizontal parallax for the nearest
                    noon or midnight from Table I. Again, to this time and the given longitude take
                    from the Nautical Almanack the moon’s horizontal parallax. Also to the time of
                    the moon’s transit over the meridian of Greenwich apply the variation answering
                    to the longitude and daily variation between the given and preceding day if tlιe
                    longitude is east. Subtract it from the transit over the meridian of Greenwich,
                    and the remainder will be the time of transit over the meridian of the given
                    place. But if the longitude be west, the correction answering to the longitude
                    and daily variation of transit between the given and following day must be added
                    to the time of transit over the meridian of Greenwich to obtain the time of
                    transit over the meridian of the given place. To the time of high water, if new
                    and full moon at the given place, add the reduced time of transit over the
                    meridian of the same place, and to the sum apply the equation from the table
                    answering to the time of transit and horizontal parallax formerly found: the
                    result will be the true mean time of high water required. The apparent time may

                <p part="N">The method commonly used at sea to find the distance sailed in a given
                    time is by means of a log-line and halfminute glass. A description of these is

                    line ought to be fifty feet, in order to adapt it to a glass that runs thirty
                    seconds. But although the line and glass be at any time perfectly adjusted to
                    each other, yet as the line shrinks after being wet, and as the weather has a
                    considerable effect upon the glass, it will therefore be necessary to examine
                    them from time to time; and the distance given by them must be corrected
                    accordingly. The distance sailed may, therefore, be affected by an error in the
                    glass, or in the line, or in both. The true distance may, however, be found as

                        sailing.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Plane sailing is the art of navigating a ship upon principles deduced
                    from the notion of the earth’s being an extended plane. On this supposition the
                    meridians are esteemed as parallel right lines. The parallels of latitude are at
                    right angles to the meridians; the lengths of the degrees on the meridians,
                    equator, and parallels of latitude, are everywhere equal; and the degrees of
                    longitude are reckoned on the parallels of latitude as well as on the equator.
                    In this sailing four things are principally concerned, namely, the <hi
                        rend="italic">course, distance, difference of latitude,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">departure.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The course is the angle contained between the meridian and the line
                    described by the ship, and is usually expressed in points of the compass.</p>
                <p part="N">The distance is the number of miles a ship has sailed on a direct course
                    in a given time.</p>

                <p part="N">The difference of latitude is the portion of a meridian contained
                    between the parallels of latitude sailed from and come to; and is reckoned
                    either north or south, according as the course is in the northern or southern
                    hemisphere.</p>
                <p part="N">The departure is the distance of the ship from the meridian of the place
                    she left, reckoned on a parallel of latitude. In this sailing, the departure and
                    difference of longitude are esteemed equal.</p>
                <p part="N">In order to illustrate the above, let A represent the position of any
                    given place, and AB the meridian passing through that place; also let AC
                    represent the line described by a ship, and C the point arrived at. From C draw
                    CB perpendicular to AB. Now in the triangle ABC, the angle BAC represents the
                    course, the side AC the distance, AB the difference of latitude, and BC the
                    departure.</p>
                <p part="N">In constructing a figure relating to a ship’s course, let the upper part
                    of what the figure is to be drawn on represent the <hi rend="italic">north,</hi>

                        >west.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">A north and south line is to be drawn to represent the meridian of the
                    place from which the ship sailed; and the upper or lower part of this line,
                    according as the course is southerly or northerly, is to be marked as the
                    position of that place. From this point as a centre, with the chord of 60°, an
                    arch is to be described from the meridian towards the right or left, according
                    as the course is easterly or westerly; and the course, taken from the line of
                    chords if given in degrees, but from the line of rhumbs if expressed in points
                    of the compass, is to be laid upon this arch, beginning at the meridian. A line
                    drawn through this point and that sailed from will represent the distance,
                    which, if given, must be laid thereon, beginning at the point sailed from. A
                    line is to be drawn from the extremity of the distance perpendicular to the
                    meridian; and hence the difference of latitude and departure will be
                    obtained.</p>
                <p part="N">If the difference of latitude is given, it is to be laid upon the
                    meridian, beginning at the point representing the place the ship left; and a
                    line drawn from the extremity of the difference of latitude perpendicular to the
                    meridian, till it meets the distance produced, will limit the figure.</p>
                <p part="N">If the departure is given, it is to be laid off on a parallel, and a
                    line drawn through its extremity will limit, the distance. When either the
                    distance and difference of latitude, distance and departure, or difference of
                    latitude and departure, are given, the measure of each is to be taken from a
                    scale of equal parts, and laid off on its respective line, and the extremities
                    connected. Hence the figure will be formed.</p>

                <p part="N">If a ship sail upon two or more courses in a given time, the irregular
                    tract she describes is called a <hi rend="italic">traverse</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >;</hi> and to resolve a traverse, is the method of reducing these several
                    courses, and the distances run, into a single course and distance. The method
                    chiefly used for this purpose at sea is by inspection, which shall therefore be
                    principally adhered to, and is as follows.</p>
                <p part="N">Make a table of a breadth and depth sufficient to contain the several
                    courses, &amp;c. This table is to be divided into six columns; the courses are
                    to be put in the first, and the corresponding distances in the second column;
                    the third and fourth columns are to contain the differences of latitude, and the
                    two last the departures.</p>
                <p part="N">Now, the several courses and their corresponding distances being
                    properly arranged in the table, find the difference of latitude and departure
                    answering to each in the traverse table; remembering that the difference of
                    latitude is to be put in a north or south column, according as the course is in
                    the northern or southern hemisphere; and that the departure is to be put in an
                    east column if the course is easterly, but in a west column if the course is
                    westerly; observing also, that the departure is less than the difference of
                    latitude when the course is less than four points, or 45°; otherwise
                    greater.</p>
                <p part="N">Add up the columns of northing, southing, easting, and westing, and set
                    down the sum of each at its bottom; then the difference between the sums of the
                    north and south columns will be the difference of latitude made good, of the
                    same name with the greater; and the difference between the sums of the east and
                    west columns is the departure made good, of the same name with the greater
                    sum.</p>
                <p part="N">Now, seek in the traverse table till a difference of latitude and
                    departure are found to agree as nearly as possible with those above; then the
                    distance will be found on the same line, and the course at the top or bottom of
                    the page, according as the difference of latitude is greater or less than the
                    departure.</p>
                <p part="N">In order to resolve a traverse by construction, describe a circle with
                    the chord of 60°, in which draw two diameters at right angles to each other, at
                    whose extremities are to be marked the initials of the cardinal points, north
                    being uppermost.</p>
                <p part="N">Lay off each course on the circumference, reckoned from its proper
                    meridian; and from the centre to each point draw lines, which are to be marked
                    with the proper number of the course.</p>
                <p part="N">On the first radius lay off the first distance from the centre, and
                    through its extremity, and parallel to the second radius, draw the second
                    distance, of its proper length; through the extremity of the second distance,
                    and parallel to the third radius, draw the third distance, of its proper length;
                    and thus proceed until all the distances are drawn.</p>
                <p part="N">A line drawn from the extremity of the last distance to tlιe centre of
                    the circle will represent the distance made good; and a line drawn from the same
                    point perpendicular to the meridian, produced if necessary, will represent the
                    departure; and the portion of the meridian intercepted between the centre and
                    departure will be the difference of latitude made good.</p>

                    places, or it is the arch of the equator intercepted between the meridians of
                    the given places; and the meridian distance between two places in the same
                    parallel is the arch thereof contained between their meridians. It hence
                    follows, that the meridian distance, answering to the same difference of
                    longitude, will vary with the latitude of the parallel upon which it is
                    reckoned; and the same difference of longitude will not answer to a given
                    meridian distance when reckoned upon different parallels.</p>
                <p part="N">Parallel sailing is, therefore, the method of finding the distance
                    between two places lying in the same parallél whose longitudes are known; or, to
                    find the difference of longitude answering to a given distance run in an east or
                    west direction. This sailing is particularly useful in making low or small
                    islánds.</p>
                <p part="N">In order to illustrate the principles of parallel sailing, let CABP
                    (fig. 9) represent a section of one fourth part of the earth, the arch ABP being
                    part of a meridian; CA the equatorial, and CP the polar semi-axis. Also let B be
                    the situation of any given place on the earth; and join BC, which will be equal
                    to CA or CP.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"

                <p part="N">The earth is a sphere, and the meridians meet at the poles; and since a
                    rhumb-line makes equal angles with every meridian, the line a ship describes is,
                    therefore, that kind of a curve called a <hi rend="italic">spiral.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Let AB (fig. 15) be any given distance sailed upon an oblique rhumb,
                    PBN, PAM the extreme meridians, MN a portion of the equator, and PCK, PEL two
                    meridians intersecting the distance AB in the points CE infinitely near each
                    other. If the arches BS, CD, and AR, be described parallel to the equator,* it
                    is hence evident that AS is the difference of latitude, and the arch MN of the
                    equator the difference of longitude, answering to the given distance AB and
                    course PAB.</p>
                <p part="N">Now, since CE represents a very small portion of the distance AB, DE
                    will be the correspondent portion of a meridian; hence the triangle EDC may be
                    considered as rectilineal. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> the distance be supposed to
                    be divided into an infinite number of parts, each equal to CE, and upon these,
                    triangles be constructed whose sides are portions of a meridian and parallel, it
                    is evident these triangles will be equal and similar; for, besides the right
                    angle, and hypothenuse which is the same in each, the course or angle CED is
                    also the same. Hence, by the J 2th of V. Eue. the sum of all the hypothenuses
                    CE, or the distance AB, is to the sum of all the sides DE, or the difference of
                    latitude AS, as one of the hypothenuses CE is to the corresponding side DE. Now,
                    let the triangle GIH (fig. 16) be constructed similar to the triangle CDE,
                    having the angle G equal to the course: then, as GH: GI:: CE: DC:: AB: AS.</p>
                <p part="N">Hence, if GH be made equaI to the given distance AB, then GI will be the
                    corresponding difference of latitude.</p>
                <p part="N">In like manner, the sum of all the hypothenuses CE, or the distance AB,
                    is to the sum of all the sides CD, as CE is to CD, or as GH to HI, because of
                    the similar triangles.</p>
                <p part="N">The several parts of the same rectilineal triangle will, therefore,
                    represent the course, distance, difference of latitude, and departure.</p>
                <p part="N">Although the parts HG, GI, and angle G of the rectilineal triangle GIH,
                    are equal to the corresponding parts AB, AS, and angle A, of the triangle ASB
                    upon the surface of the sphere; yet HI is not equal to BS, for HI is the sum of
                    all the arcs CD; but CD is greater than OQ, and less than ZX: therefore HI is
                    greater than BS, and less than AR. Hence the difference of longitude MN cannot
                    be inferred from the departure reckoned either upon the parallel sailed from or
                    upon that come to, but on some intermediate parallel TV, such that the arch TV
                    is exactly equal to the departure; and, in this case, the difference of
                    longitude would be easily obtained. For TV is to MN as the sine PT to the sine
                    PM; that is, as the cosine of latitude is to the radius.</p>
                <p part="N">The latitude of the parallel TV is not, however, easily determined with
                    accuracy: various methods have, therefore, been taken in order to obtain it
                    nearly, with as little trouble as possible; first, by taking the arithmetical
                    mean of the two latitudes for that of the mean parallel; secondly, by using the
                    arithmetical mean of the cosines of the latitudes; thirdly, by using the
                    geometrical mean of the cosines of the latitudes; and, lastly, by employing the
                    parallel deduced from the mean of the meridional parts of the two latitudes. The
                    first of these methods is that which is generally used.</p>
                <p part="N">In order to illustrate the computations in middle latitude sailing, let
                    the triangle ABC (fig. 17) represent a figure in plane sailing, wherein AB is
                    the difference of latitude, AC the distance, BC the departure, and the angle BAC
                    the course. Also, let the triangle DBC be a figure in parallel sailing, in which
                    DC is the difference of longitude, BC the meridian distance, and the angle DCB
                    the middle latitude. In these triangles there is, therefore, one side BC common
                    to both; and that triangle is to be first resolved in which two parts are given,
                    and then the unknown parts of the other triangle will be easily obtained.</p>

                <p part="N">The above method is that always practised'to find the difference of
                    longitude made good in the course of a day’s run, and will, no doubt, give the
                    difference of longitude tolerably exact in any probable run a ship may make in
                    that time, especially near the equator. But in a high latitude, when the
                    distances are considerable, this method is not to be depended on. To illustrate
                    this, let a ship be supposed to sail from latitude 57° N., as follows: E. 240
                    miles, N. 240 miles, W. 240 miles, and S. 240 miles; then, by the above method,
                    the ship will be come to the same place she left. It will, however, appear
                    evident from the following consideration, that this is by no means the case; for
                    let two ships, from latitude 61° N., and distant 240 miles, sail directly south
                    till they are in latitude 57° N.; now, their distance, being computed by Problem
                    IV. of Parallel Sailing, will be 269∙6 miles; and therefore, if the ship sailed
                    as above, she will be 29∙6 miles west of the place sailed from, and the error in
                    longitude will be equal to 240 × secant 61° —secant 57° = 29∙6 X secant 57° =
                    54∙4∙</p>
                <p part="N">Theorems might be investigated for computing the errors to which the
                    above method is liable. These corrections may, however, be avoided, by using the
                    following method.</p>

                    sums of each following pair of latitude; the third, half the sums, or middle

                <p part="N">It was observed, in Middle Latitude Sailing, that the difference of
                    longitude made upon an oblique rhumb· could not be exactly determined by using
                    the middle latitude. In Mercator’s Sailing the difference of longitude is very
                    easily found, and the several problems of sailing are resolved with the utmost
                    accuracy, by the assistance of Mercator’s chart or equivalent tables.</p>
                <p part="N">In Mercator’s chart, the meridians are straight lines parallel to each
                    other; and the degrees of latitude, which at the equator are equal to those of
                    longitude, increase with the distance of the parallel from the equator. The
                    parts of the meridian thus increased are called <hi rend="italic">meridional
                        parts.</hi> A table of these parts was first constructed by Mr Edward
                    Wright, by the continual addition of the secants of each minute of latitude.</p>
                <p part="N">For by parallel sailing,</p>

                <p part="N">And because the equator and meridian on the globe are equal;
                    therefore,</p>

                    difference of latitude multiplied by the tangent of the course, and divided by
                    the radius.</p>
                <p part="N">This equation answers to a right-angled rectilineal triangle, having an
                    angle equal to the course; the adjacent side equal to the meridional difference
                    of latitude, and the opposite side the difference of longitude. This triangle
                    is, therefore, similar to a triangle constructed, with the course and difference
                    of latitude, according to the principles of plane sailing, and the homologous
                    sides will be proportional. Hence, if, in fig. 26, the angle A represents the
                    course, AB the difference of latitude, and if AD be made equal to the meridional
                    difference of latitude, then DE, drawn perpendicular to AD, meeting the distance
                    produced to E, will be the difference of longitude.</p>

                <p part="N">The computations in the preceding chapters have been performed upon the
                    assumption that the water has no motion. This may no doubt answer tolerably well
                    in those places where the ebbings and flowings are regular, as then the effect
                    of the tide will be nearly counterbalanced. But in places where there is a
                    constant current or setting of the sea towards the same point, an allowance for
                    the change of the ship’s place arising therefrom must be made. And the method of
                    resolving these problems, in which the effect of a current or heave of the sea
                    is taken into consideration, is called <hi rend="italic">current
                    sailing.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">In a calm, it is evident a ship will be carried in the direction and
                    with the velocity of the current. Hence, if a ship sails in the direction of the
                    current, her rate will be augmented by the rate of the current; but if sailing
                    di rectly against it, the distance made good will be equal to the difference
                    between the ship’s rate as given by the log’ and that of the current. And the
                    absolute motion of the ship will be a-head if her rate exceeds that of the
                    current; but if less, the ship will make stern way. If the ship’s course be
                    oblique to the current, the distance made good in a given time will be
                    represented by the third side of a triangle, whereof the distance given by the
                    log, and the drift of the current in the same time, are the other sides; and the
                    true course will be the angle contained between the meridian and the line
                    actually described by the ship.</p>

                <p part="N">Various methods besides those already given have been proposed, to save
                    the trouble of calculation. One of these methods is by means of an instrument

                    numbers in a regular progression marked on their sides. These instruments are
                    made of different materials, such as paper, wood, brass, &amp;c. and are
                    differently constructed, according to the fancy of the inventor. A number of

                <p part="N">The charts usually employed in the practice of navigation are of two
                    kinds, namely, <hi rend="italic">Plane</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mercator’s
                        Charts.</hi> The first of these is adapted to represent a portion of the
                    earth’s surface near the equator, and the last for all portions of the earth’s
                    surface. For a particular description of these, see the article <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Chart</hi>; and as these are particularly described under
                    the above article, it is therefore sufficient in this place to describe their
                    use.</p>

                    give the latitude of the proposed place.</p>
                <p part="N">Thus the distance between Bonavista and the parallel of 15°, being laid

                    points may be perpendicular thereto; then will the other point show the course.
                    The interval between the places, being applied to the scale, will give the
                    required distance.</p>
                <p part="N">Thus the course from Palmato St Vincent will be found to be about S. S.
                    W. f W. and the distance 13½ <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi>, or 795 miles.</p>

                <p part="N">The frame of the quadrant consists of an arch BC, firmly attached to the
                    two radii AB, AC, which are bound together by the braces LM, in order to
                    strengthen it, and prevent it from warping.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Of the Index</hi> D.</p>
                <p part="N">The index is a flat bar of brass, and turns on the centre of the octant:
                    at the lower end of the index there is an oblong opening; to one side of this
                    opening the vernier scale is fixed, to subdivide the divisions of the arch; at
                    the end of the index there is a piece of brass, which bends under the arch,
                    carrying a spring to make the subdividing scale lie close to the divisions. It
                    is also furnished with a screw to fix the index in any desired position. The
                    best instruments have an adjusting screw fitted to the index, that it may be
                    moved more slowly, and with greater regularity and accuracy, than by the hand.
                    It is proper, however, to observe, that the index must be previously fixed near
                    its right position by the above-mentioned screw.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Of the Index-Glass</hi> E.</p>
                <p part="N">Upon the index, and near its axis of motion, is fixed a plane speculum,
                    or mirror of glass quicksilvered. It is set in a brass frame, and is placed so
                    that its face is perpendicular to the plane of the instrument. This mirror being
                    fixed to the index, moves along with it, and has its direction changed by the
                    motion thereof; and the intention of this glass is to receive the image of the
                    sun, or any other object, and reflect it upon either of the two horizon-glasses,
                    according to the nature of the observation.</p>
                <p part="N">The brass frame with the glass is fixed to the index by the screw c; the
                    other screw serves to replace it in a perpendicular position, if by any accident
                    it has been deranged.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Of the Horizon-Glasses</hi> F, G.</p>
                <p part="N">On the radius AB of the octant are two small speculums: the surface of
                    the upper one is parallel to the indexglass, and that of the lower one
                    perpendicular thereto, when 0 on the index coincides with 0 on the limb. These
                    mirrors receive the reflected rays, and transmit them to the observer.</p>
                <p part="N">The horizon-glasses are not entirely quicksilvered; the upper one F is
                    only silvered on its lower half, or that next the plane of the quadrant, the
                    other half being left transparent, and the back part of the frame cut away, that
                    nothing may impede the sight through the unsilvered part of the glass. The edge
                    of the foil of this glass is nearly parallel to the plane of the instrument, and
                    ought to be very sharp, and without a flaw. The other horizon-glass is silvered
                    at both ends. In the middle there is a transparent slit, through which the
                    horizon may be seen.</p>
                <p part="N">Each of these glasses is set in a brass frame, to which there is an axis
                    passing through the wood-work, and is fitted to a lever on the under side of the
                    quadrant, by which the glass may be turned a few degrees on its axis, in order
                    to set it parallel to the index-glass. The lever has a contrivance to turn it
                    slowly, and a button to fix it. To set the glasses perpendicular to the plane of
                    the instrument, there are two sunk screws, one before and one behind each glass:
                    these screws pass through the plate on which the frame is fixed, into another
                    plate; so that by loosening one and tightening the other of these screws, the
                    direction of the frame with its mirror may be altered, and set perpendicular to
                    the plane of the instrument.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Of the Coloured Glasses</hi> K.</p>
                <p part="N">There are usually three coloured classes, two of which are tinged red
                    and the other green. They are used to prevent the solar rays from hurting the
                    eye at the time of observation. These glasses are set in a frame, which turns on
                    a centre, so that they may be used separately or together as the brightness of
                    the sun may require. The green glass is particularly useful in observations of
                    the moon; it may be also used in observations of the sun, if that object be very
                    faint. In the fore observation, these glasses are fixed as in fig. 39; but when
                    the back observation is used, they are removed to N.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Of the two Sight Vanes,</hi> H, I.</p>
                <p part="N">Each of these vanes is a perforated piece of brass, designed to direct
                    the sight parallel to the plane of the quadrant. That which is fixed at I is
                    used for the fore, and the other for the back observation. The vane I has two
                    holes, one exactly at the height of the silvered part of the horizon-glass, the
                    other a little higher, to direct the sight to the middle of the transparent part
                    of the mirror.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Of the Divisions on the Limb of the Quadrant.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The limb of the quadrant is divided from right to left into 90 primary
                    divisions, which are to be considered as degrees, and each degree is subdivided
                    into three equal parts, which are therefore of 20 minutes each: the intermediate
                    minutes are obtained by means of the scale of divisions at the end of the
                    index.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193829297?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9297-0776"/>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Of the Vernier, or Subdividing Scale.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The dividing scale contains a space equal to 21 divisions of the limb,
                    and is divided into 20 equal parts. Hence the difference between a division on
                    the dividing scale and a division on the limb is one twentieth of a division on
                    the limb, or one minute. The degree and minute pointed out by the dividing scale
                    may be easily found thus.</p>
                <p part="N">Observe what minute on the dividing scale coincides with a division on
                    the limb; this division being added to the degree and part of a degree on the
                    limb, immediately preceding the first division on the dividing scale, will be
                    the degree and minute required.</p>
                <p part="N">Thus, suppose the fourteenth minute on the dividing scale coincided with
                    a division on the limb, and that the preceding division on the limb to 0 on the
                    vernier was 56° 40'; hence the division shown by the vernier is 56° 54'. A
                    magnifying glass will assist the observer to read off the coinciding divisions
                    with more accuracy.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Adjustments of Hadley s Quadrant.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The adjustments of the quadrant consist in placing the mirrors
                    perpendicular to the plane of the instrument. The fore horizon-glass must be set
                    parallel to the speculum, and the planes of the speculum and back horizon-glass
                    produced must be perpendicular to each other when the index is at 0.</p>

                    that its plane may be nearly parallel to the horizon: then look into the
                    index-glass, and if the portion of the limb seen by reflection appears in the
                    same plane with that seen directly, the speculum is perpendicular to the plane
                    of the instrument. If they do not appear in the same plane, the error is to be
                    rectified by altering the position of the screws behind the frame of the
                    glass.</p>

                    is perpendicular to the plane of the instrument; if not, one of the horizons
                    will appear higher than the other. Now if the horizon seen by reflection is
                    higher than that seen directly, release the nearest screw in the pedestal of the
                    glass, and screw up that on the farther side, till the direct and reflected
                    horizons appear to make one continued straight line. But if the reflected
                    horizon is lower than that seen directly, unscrew the farthest, and screw up the

                    leave both screws equally tight, and the fore horizon-glass will be

                    the horizon seen in the silvered part coincides with that seen through the
                    transparent part, the horizon-glass is adjusted; but if the horizons do not

                    the horizons do not unite, turn the sunk screws in the pedestal of the glass

                    directly, the glass is adjusted; if they do not coincide, the screw in the
                    middle of the lever on the other side of the quadrant must be released, and the
                    nut at its extremity turned till both horizons coincide. It may be observed,
                    that the reflected horizon will be inverted; that is, the sea will be apparently
                    uppermost and the sky lowermost.</p>
                <p part="N">This method of adjustment is esteemed troublesome, and is often found to
                    be very difficult to perform at sea, on which account the method of observation
                    by the back horizon-glass is seldom or never used.</p>

                <p part="N">The altitude of any object is determined by the position of the index on
                    the limb, when by reflection that object appears to be in contact with the
                    horizon.</p>
                <p part="N">If the object whose altitude is to be observed be the sun, and if so
                    bright that its image may be seen in the transparent part of the fore
                    horizon-glass, the eye is to be applied to the upper hole in the sight-vane;
                    otherwise, to the lower hole: and in this case the quadrant is to be held so
                    that the sun may be bisected by the line of separation of the silvered and
                    transparent parts of the glass. The moon is to be kept as nearly as possible in
                    the same position; and the image of the star is to be observed in the silvered
                    part of the glass adjacent to the line of separation of the two parts.</p>
                <p part="N">There are two different methods of taking observations with the
                    quadrant. In the first of these the face of the observer is directed towards
                    that part of the horizon immediately under the sun, and is therefore called the
                        <hi rend="italic">fore observation.</hi> In the other method, the observer’s
                    back is to the sun, and it is hence called the <hi rend="italic">bach
                        observation.</hi> This last method of observation is to be used only when
                    the horizon under the sun is obscured, or rendered indistinct by fog or any
                    other impediment.</p>
                <p part="N">In taking the sun’s altitude, whether by the fore or back observation,
                    the observer must turn the quadrant about upon the axis of vision, and at the
                    same time turn himself about upon his heel, so as to keep the sun always in that
                    part of the horizon-glass which is at the same distance as the eye from the
                    plane of the quadrant. In this way the reflected sun will describe an arch of a
                    parallel circle round the true sun, the convex side of which will be downwards
                    in the fore observation and upwards in the back; and consequently, when, by
                    moving the index, the lowest point of <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193829310?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9310-0777"/>the arch in
                    the fore observation, or highest in the back, is made to touch the horizon, the
                    quadrant will stand in a vertical plane, and the altitude above the visible
                    horizon will be properly observed. The reason of these operations may be thus
                    explained: The image of the sun being always kept in the axis of vision, the
                    index will always show on the quadrant the distance between the sun and any
                    object seen directly which its image appears to touch; therefore, as long as the
                    index remains unmoved, the image of the sun will describe an arch everywhere
                    equidistant from the sun in the heavens, and consequently a parallel circle
                    about the sun as a pole. Such a translation of the sun’s image can only be
                    produced by the quadrant’s being turned about upon a line drawn from the eye to
                    the sun as an axis. A motion of rotation upon this line may be resolved into
                    two, one upon the axis of vision, and the other upon a line on the quadrant
                    perpendicular to the axis of vision; and consequently a proper combination of
                    these two motions will keep the image of the sun constantly in the axis of
                    vision, and cause both jointly to run over a parallel circle about the sun in
                    the heavens; but when the quadrant is vertical, a line thereon perpendicular to
                    the axis of vision becomes a vertical axis; and as a small motion of the
                    quadrant is all that is wanted, it will never differ much in practice from a
                    vertical axis. The observer is directed to perform two motions rather than the
                    single one equivalent to them on a line drawn from the eye to the sun; because
                    we are not capable, while looking towards the horizon, of judging how to turn
                    the quadrant about upon the elevated line going to the sun as an axis, by any
                    other means than by combining the two motions above mentioned, so as to keep the
                    sun’s image always in the proper part of the horizon-glass. When the sun is near
                    the horizon, the line going from the eye to the sun will not be far removed from
                    the axis of vision; and consequently the principal motion of the quadrant will
                    be performed on the axis of vision, and the part of motion made on the vertical
                    axis will be but small. <hi rend="italic">Or</hi> the contrary, when the sun is
                    near the zenith, the line going to the sun is not far removed from a vertical
                    line, and consequently the principal motion of the quadrant will be performed on
                    a vertical axis, by the observer’s turning himself about, and the part of the
                    motion made on the axis of vision will be but small. In intermediate altitudes
                    of the sun, the motions of the quadrant on the axis of vision, and on the
                    vertical axis, will be more equally divided.</p>
                <p part="N">Observations taken with the quadrant are liable to errors, arising from
                    the bending and elasticity of the index, and the resistance it meets with in
                    turning round its centre; whence the extremity of the index, on being pushed
                    along the arch, will sensibly advance before the index-glass begins to move, and
                    may be seen to recoil when the force acting on it is removed. Mr Hadley seems to
                    have been apprehensive that his instrument would be liable to errors from this
                    cause; and, in order to avoid them, gives particular directions that the index
                    be made broad at the end next the centre, and that the centre, or axis itself,
                    have as easy a motion as is consistent with steadiness; that is, an entire
                    freedom from looseness, or <hi rend="italic">shake as</hi> the workmen term it.
                    By strictly complying with these directions the error in question may indeed be
                    greatly diminished; so far, perhaps, as to render it nearly insensible, where
                    the index is made strong, and the proper medium between the two extremes of a
                    shake at the centre on one hand, and too much stiffness there on the other, is
                    nicely hit: but it cannot be entirely corrected; for to more or less of bending
                    the index will always be subject, and some degree of resistance will remain at
                    the centre, unless the friction there could be totally removed, which is
                    impossible.</p>
                <p part="N">Of the reality of the error to which he is liable from this cause, the
                    observer, if he is provided with a quadrant furnished with a screw for moving
                    the index gradually, may thus satisfy himself. After finishing the observation,
                    lay the quadrant on a table, and note the angle; then cautiously loosen the
                    screw which fastens the index, and it will immediately, if the quadrant is not
                    remarkably well constructed, be seen to start from its former situation, more or
                    less according to the perfection of the joint and the strength of the index.
                    This starting, which is owing to the index recoiling after being released from
                    the confined state it was in during the observation, will sometimes amount to
                    several minutes; and its direction will be opposite to that in which the index
                    was moved by the screw at the time of finishing the observation. But how far it
                    affects the truth of the observation, depends on the manner in which the index
                    was moved in setting it to 0, for adjusting the instrument; or in finishing the
                    observations necessary for finding the index error.</p>
                <p part="N">The easiest and best rule to avoid these errors seems to be this: In all
                    observations made by Hadley’s quadrant, let the observer take notice constantly
                    to finish his observations by moving the index in the same direction which was
                    used in setting it to 0 for adjusting, or in the observations necessary for
                    finding the index error. If this rule is observed, the error arising from the
                    spring of the index will be obviated. For as the index was bent the same way,
                    and in the same degree, in adjusting as in observing, the truth of the
                    observations will not be affected by this bending.</p>

                    that of the meridional altitude of a known celestial object; or two altitudes
                    when the object is out of the meridian. The latitude is deduced with more
                    certainty and with less trouble from the first of these methods than from the
                    second; and the sun, for various reasons, is the object most proper for this
                    purpose at sea. It, however, frequently happens that, by the interposition of
                    clouds, the sun is obscured at noon, and by this means the meridian altitude is
                    lost. In this case, therefore, the method by double altitudes becomes necessary.
                    The latitude may be deduced from three altitudes of an unknown object, or from
                    double altitudes, the apparent times of observation being given.</p>
                <p part="N">The altitude of the limb of an object observed at sea requires four

                <p part="N">The dip in the preceding table answers to an entirely open and
                    unobstructed horizon. It, however, frequently happens that the sun is over the
                    land at the time of observation, and the ship nearer to the land than the
                    visible horizon would be if unconfined. In this case, the dip will be different
                    from what it would otherwise have been, and is to be taken from the subjoined
                    table, in which the height is expressed at the top, and the distance from the
                    land in the side column in nautical miles. Seamen, in general, can estimate the
                    distance of any object from the ship with sufficient exactness for this purpose,
                    especially when that distance is not greater than six miles, which is the
                    greatest distance of the visible horizon from an observer on the deck of any
                    ship.</p>

                <p part="N">The observations necessary to determine the longitude by this method
                    are, the distance between the sun and moon, the moon and a planet, or the moon
                    and a fixed star near the ecliptic, together with the altitude of each. The
                    planets used in the Nautical Almanac for this purpose are the following:—Venus,
                    Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The stars are, <hi rend="italic">α</hi><hi

                        Pegasi</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the distances of the moon’s centre
                    from the sun, and from one or more of these planets and stars, are contained in
                    the xiiith—xviiith pages of the month, at the beginning of every third hour mean
                    time by the meridian of Greenwich. The distance between the moon and one of
                    these objects is observed with a sextant; and the altitudes of the objects are
                    taken as usual with a Hadley’s quadrant.</p>
                <p part="N">In the practice of this method, it will be found convenient to be
                    provided with three assistants. Two of these are to take the altitudes of the
                    sun and moon, or moon and star, at the same time that the principal observer is
                    taking the distance between the objects; and the third assistant is to observe
                    the time, and write down the observations. In order to obtain accuracy, it will
                    be necessary to observe several distances, and the corresponding altitudes, the
                    intervals of time between them being as short as possible; and the sum of each
                    divided by the number will give the mean distance and mean altitudes; from which
                    the time of observation at Greenwich is to be computed by the rules to be
                    explained.</p>
                <p part="N">If the sun or star from which the moon’s distance is observed be at a
                    proper distance from the meridian, the time at the ship may be inferred from the
                    altitude observed at the same time with the distance. In this case the watch is
                    not necessary; but if that object be near the meridian, the watch is absolutely
                    necessary, in order to connect the observations for ascertaining the mean time
                    at the ship and at Greenwich with each other.</p>
                <p part="N">An observer without any assistants may very easily take all the
                    observations, by first taking the altitudes of the objects, then the distance,
                    and again their altitudes, and reduce the altitudes to the time of observation
                    of the distance; or, by a single observation of the distance, the time being
                    known from which the altitudes of the bodies may be computed, the longitude may
                    be determined.</p>
                <p part="N">A set of observations of the distance between the moon and a star or
                    planet, and their altitudes, may be taken with accuracy during the time of the
                    evening or morning twilight; and the observer, though not much acquainted with
                    the stars, will not find it difficult to distinguish the star from which the
                    moon’s distance is to be observed. For the time of observation nearly, and the
                    ship’s longitude by account being known, the estimate time at Greenwich may be
                    found; and by entering the Nautical Almanac with the reduced time, the distance
                    between the moon and given star will be found nearly. Now set the index of the
                    sextant to this distance, and hold the plane of the instrument so as to be
                    nearly at right angles to the line joining the moon’s cusps; direct the sight to
                    the moon, and, by giving the sextant a slow vibratory motion, the axis of which
                    being that of vision, the star, which is usually one of the brightest in that
                    part of the heavens, will be seen in the transparent part of the
                    horizon-glass.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of the
                        Sextant.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">This instrument is constructed for the express purpose of measuring with
                    accuracy the angular distance between the sun and moon, or between the moon and
                    a planet or fixed star, in order to ascertain the longitude of a place by lunar
                    observations. It is, therefore, made with more care than the quadrant, and has
                    some additional appendages that are wanting in that instrument.</p>
                <p part="N">Fig. 40 represents the sextant, so framed as not to be liable to bend.
                    The arch AA is divided into 120 degrees; each degree is divided into three
                    parts; each of these parts, therefore, contains twenty minutes, which are again
                    subdivided by the vernier into every half minute or thirty seconds. The vernier
                    is, numbered at every fifth of the longer divisions, from the right towards the
                    left, with 5, 10, 15, and 20; the first division to the right being the
                    beginning of the scale.</p>
                <p part="N">In order to observe with accuracy, and make the images come precisely in
                    contact, an adjusting screw B is added to the index, which may thereby be moved
                    with greater accuracy than it can be by the hand; but this screw does not act
                    until the index is fixed by the finger-screw C. Care should be taken not to
                    force the adjusting screw when it arrives at either extremity of its adjustment.
                    When the index is to be moved any considerable quantity, the screw C at the back
                    of the sextant must be loosened; but when the index is brought nearly to the
                    division required, this back screw should be tightened, and then the index may
                    be moved gradually by the adjusting screw.</p>
                <p part="N">There are four tinged glasses D, each of which is set in a separate
                    frame that turns on a centre. They are used to defend the eye from the
                    brightness of the solar image and the glare of the moon, and may be used
                    separately or together as occasion requires.</p>
                <p part="N">There are three more such glasses placed behind the horizon-glass at E,
                    to weaken the rays of the sun or moon when they are viewed directly through the
                    horizon-glass. The paler glass is sometimes used in observing altitudes at sea,
                    to take off the strong glare of the horizon.</p>
                <p part="N">The frame of the index-glass I is firmly fixed by a strong cock to the
                    centre plate of the index. The horizon-glass F is fixed in a frame that turns on
                    the axes or pivots, which move in an exterior frame; the holes in which the
                    pivots move may be tightened by four screws in the exterior frame. G is a screw
                    by which the horizon-glass may be set perpendicular to the plane of the
                    instrument: should this screw become loose, or move too easy, it may be easily
                    tightened by turning the capstan headed screw H, which <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193829388?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9388-0783"/>is on one
                    side of the socket through which the stern of the finger-screw passes.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> The sextant is furnished with a plain
                    tube without any glasses; and to render the objects still more distinct, it has
                    two telescopes, one representing the objects erect, or in their natural
                    position: the longer one shows them inverted; it has a large field of view, and
                    other advantages, and a little use will soon accustom the observer to the
                    inverted position, and the instrument will be as readily managed by it as by the
                    plain tube alone. By a telescope the contact of the images is more perfectly
                    distinguished; and by the place of the images in the field of the telescope, it
                    is easy to perceive whether the sextant is held in the proper place for
                    observation. By sliding the tube that contains the eye-glasses in the inside of
                    the other tube, the object is suited to different eyes, and made to appear

                <p part="N">The telescopes are to be screwed into a circular ring at K; this ring
                    rests on two points against an exterior ring, and is held thereto by two screws:
                    by turning one or other of these screws, and tightening the other, the axis of
                    the telescope may be set parallel to the plane of the sextant. The exterior ring
                    is fixed on a triangular brass stem that slides in a socket, and, by means of a
                    screw at the back of the quadrant, may be raised or lowered so as to move the
                    centre of the telescope to point to that part of the horizonglass which shall be
                    judged the most fit for observation. Tinged glasses are provided to screw on the
                    eye end of either of the telescopes or the plain tube.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Adjustments of the Sextant.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The adjustments of a sextant are, to set the mirrors perpendicular to
                    its plane and parallel to each other when the index is at zero, and to set the
                    axis of the telescope parallel to the plane of the instrument. The three first
                    of these adjustments are performed nearly in the same manner as directed in the
                    section on the quadrant; as, however, the sextant is provided with a set of
                    coloured glasses placed behind the horizon-glass, the index error may be more
                    accurately determined by measuring the sun’s diameter twice, with the index
                    placed alternately before and behind the beginning of the divisions; half the
                    difference of these two measures will be the index error, which must be added to
                    or subtracted from all observations, according as the diameter measured with the
                    index to the left of 0 is less or greater than the diameter measured with the
                    index to the right of the beginning of the divisions. It will be more accurate
                    to measure the sun’s horizontal diameter, as the vertical diameter is often
                    affected with refraction.</p>

                <p part="N">Turn the eye end of the telescope until the two wires are parallel to
                    the plane of the instrument; and let two distant objects be selected, as two
                    stars of the first magnitude, whose distance is not less than 90° or I00°; make
                    the contact of these objects as perfect as possible at the wire nearest the
                    plane of the instrument; fix the index in this position; move the sextant till
                    the objects are seen at the other wire, and if the same points are in contact,
                    the axis of the telescope is parallel to the plane of the sextant; but if the
                    objects are apparently separated, or do partly cover each other, correct half
                    the error by the screws in the circular part of the supporter, one of which is
                    above and the other between the telescope and sextant; turn the adjusting screw
                    at the end of the index till the limbs are in contact; then bring the objects to
                    the wire next the instrument; and if the limbs are in contact, the axis of the
                    telescope is adjusted; if not, proceed as at the other wire, and continue till
                    no error remains.</p>
                <p part="N">It is sometimes necessary to know the angular distance between the wires
                    of the telescope; to find which, place the wires perpendicular to the plane of
                    the sextant, hold the instrument vertical, direct the sight to the horizon, and
                    move the sextant in its own plane till the horizon and upper wire coincide; keep
                    the sextant in this position, and move the index till the reflected horizon is
                    covered by the lower wire, and the division shown by the index of the limb,
                    corrected by the index error, will be the angular distance between the wires.
                    Other and better methods will readily occur to the observer at land.</p>

                <p part="N">When the distance between the moon and the sun, a planet or a star, is
                    to be observed, the sextant must be held so that its plane may pass through the
                    eye of the observer and both objects; and the reflected image of the most
                    luminous of the two is to be brought in contact with the other seen directly. To
                    effect this, therefore, it is evident, that when the brightest object is to the
                    right of the other, the face of the sextant must be held upwards; but if to the
                    left, downwards. When the face of the sextant is held upwards, the instrument
                    should be supported with the right hand, and the index moved with the left hand.
                    But when the face of the sextant is from the observer, it should oe held with
                    the left hand, and the motion of the index regulated by the right hand.</p>
                <p part="N">Sometimes a sitting posture will be found very convenient for the
                    observer, particularly when the reflected object is to the right of the direct
                    one; in this case the instrument is supported by the right hand, the elbow may
                    rest on the right knee, the right leg at the same time resting on the left
                    knee.</p>
                <p part="N">If the sextant is provided with a ball and socket, and a staff, one of
                    whose ends is attached thereto, and the other rests in a belt fastened round the
                    body of the observer, the greater part of the weight of the instrument will by
                    this means be supported by his body.</p>

                    the horizonglass, or to the line of separation of the silvered and transparent
                    parts, according to the brightness of the sun, and turn down one of the coloured
                    glasses; then hold the sextant so that its plane produced may pass through the
                    sun and moon, having its face either upwards or downwards, according as the sun
                    is to the right or left of the moon; direct the sight through the telescope to
                    the moon, and move the index till the limb of the sun is nearly in contact with
                    the enlightened limb of the moon; now fasten the index, and by a gentle motion
                    of the instrument make the image of the sun move alternately past the moon; and,
                    when in that position where the limbs are nearest each other, make the
                    coincidence of the limbs perfect by means of the adjusting screw; this being
                    effected, read off the degrees and parts of a degree shown by the index on the
                    limb, using the magnifying glass; and thus the angular distance between the

                    so that its plane may be parallel to that passing through the eye of the

                    the star, but if to the left the face is to be held from the observer; now
                    direct the sight through the telescope to the star, and move the index till the
                    moon appears by the reflection to be near!y in contact with the star; fasten the
                    index, and turn the adjusting screw till the coincidence of the star and

                        Instrument of Reflection.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">This instrument was proposed with a view to correct the errors to which
                    the sextant is liable, particularly the error arising from the inaccuracy of the
                    divisions on the limb. It consists of the following parts, a circular ring or
                    limb, two moveable indices, two mirrors, a telescope, coloured glasses,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p part="N">The limb of this instrument is a complete circle of metal, and is
                    connected with a perforated central plate by six radii; it is divided into 720
                    degrees, each degree being divided into three equal parts, and the division
                    carried to minutes by means of the index scale as usual.</p>
                <p part="N">The two indices are moveable about the same axis, which passes exactly
                    through the centre of the instrument :—the first index carries the central
                    mirror, and the other the telescope and horizon-glass, each index being provided
                    with an adjusting screw for regulating its motion, and a scale for showing the
                    divisions on the limb.</p>
                <p part="N">The central mirror is placed on the first index, immediately above the
                    centre of the instrument, and its plane makes an angle of about 30° with the
                    middle line of the index. The four screws in its pedestal for making its plane
                    perpendicular to that of the instrument have square heads, and are therefore
                    easily turned either way by a key for that purpose.</p>
                <p part="N">The horizon-glass is placed on the second index near the limb, so that
                    as few as possible may be intercepted of the rays proceeding from the reflected
                    object when to the left. The perpendicular position of this glass is rectified
                    in the same manner as that of the horizon-glass of a sextant, to which it is
                    similar. It has another motion, whereby its plane may be disposed so as to make
                    a proper angle with the axis of the telescope, and a line joining its centre and
                    that of the central mirror.</p>
                <p part="N">The telescope is attached to the other end of the index. It is an
                    achromatic astronomical one, and therefore inverts objects; it has two parallel
                    wires in the common focus of the glasses, whose angular distance is between two
                    and three degrees, and which, at the time of observation, must be placed
                    parallel to the plane of the instrument. This is easily done, by making the mark
                    on the eye-piece coincide with that on the tube. The telescope is moveable by
                    two screws in a vertical direction with regard to the plane of the instrument,
                    but is not capable of receiving a lateral motion.</p>
                <p part="N">There are two sets of coloured glasses, each set containing four, and
                    differing in shade from each other. The glasses of the larger set, which belongs
                    to the central mirror, should have each about half the degree of shade with
                    which the correspondent glass of the set belonging to the horizon-mirror is
                    tinged. These glasses are kept tight in their places by small pressing screws,
                    and make an angle of about 85° with the plane of the instrument, by which means
                    the image from the coloured glass is not reflected to the telescope. When the
                    angle to be measured is between 5° and 34°, one of the glasses of the largest
                    set is to be placed before the horizon-glass.</p>

                <p part="N">CHAP. III. TO FIND THE LONGITUDE BY MEANS OF A</p>
                <p part="N">CHRONOMETER.</p>
                <p part="N">In order to find the longitude at sea by means of a chronometer, its
                    daily rate on mean solar or sidereal time must be established by observations
                    made at some particular place, and its error ascertained for the meridian of
                    that or of any other known place.</p>
                <p part="N">An observatory is the most proper and convenient place for this purpose,
                    as there the rate and error may be both determined with the utmost accuracy by
                    equal altitudes, or transits over the meridian of the sun or stars. But if an
                    observatory is not adjacent, the rate and error of the chronometer may be found
                    by altitudes taken daily for several days from the horizon of the sea, or by the
                    method of reflection from an artificial horizon.</p>
                <p part="N">If by these observations the daily rate is found to be nearly the same;
                    that is, if the chronometer gains or loses nearly the same portion of absolute
                    time daily, it may be depended on for finding the longitude; but if its rate is
                    unequal, it must be rejected, as the longitude inferred from it cannot be
                    expected to be accurate.</p>
                <p part="N">It would be proper to have two chronometers, and that they should be
                    wound up at different stated times of the day, so that if one should be found
                    stopt, either through neglect in winding up, or otherwise, it may be set by the
                    other, observing to apply the former interval of time between them, and the
                    change in their rates of going in that interval.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Prob.</hi> To find the longitude of a ship at sea
                    by a chronometer.</p>
                <p part="N">Let several altitudes of the sun, or of any fixed star or planet, be
                    observed, and find the true mean altitude; with which, the ship’s latitude, and
                    object’s declination, compute the mean time of observation.</p>
                <p part="N">To the mean of the times of observation, as shown by the chronometer,
                    apply its error and accumulated rate. Hence the mean time under the meridian of
                    the place where the error and rate were established will be known; to which
                    apply the difference of longitude in time between that place and Greenwich, and
                    the mean time of observation under the meridian of Greenwich will be obtained.
                    The difference between the time at the place of observation and that at
                    Greenwich will be the longitude of the ship in time; and it is east or west,
                    according as the time, by observation, is later or earlier than the Greenwich

                <p part="N">The variation of the compass is the deviation of the points of the
                    mariner’s compass from the corresponding points of the horizon, and is
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">east</hi> or <hi rend="italic">west</hi>
                    variation, according as the north point of the compass is to the east or west of
                    the true north point of the horizon.</p>
                <p part="N">A particular account of the variation, and of the several instruments
                    used for determining it from observation, may be seen under the articles <hi

                    the log. sine of the sun’s declination, the sun will be the log. cosine of the

                    declination is north or south.</p>
                <p part="N">The difference between the true and observed amplitudes, reckoned from
                    the same point, and if of the same name, is the variation; but if of a different
                    name, their sum is the variation.</p>
                <p part="N">If the observation be made before noon, the variation will be east or
                    west, according as the observed amplitude is nearer to or more remote from the
                    north than the true amplitude. The contrary rule holds good in observations

                    transactions that happen aboard a ship, whether at sea or land, and more
                    particularly that which concerns a ship’s way, from whence her place at noon or
                    any other time may be justly ascertained.</p>
                <p part="N">That part of the account which is kept at sea is called <hi
                        rend="italic">sea work</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the remarks taken

                <p part="N">At sea, the day begins at noon, and ends at the noon of the following

                    March 6, began on Tuesday at noon, and ended on Wednesday at noon. The days of
                    the week are usually represented by astronomical characters. Thus 0 represents
                    Sunday; J , Monday; $ , Tuesday; ÿ , Wednesday; 1∫, Thursday; $, Friday; and ¾,
                    Saturday.</p>
                <p part="N">When a ship is bound to a port so situated that she will be out of sight
                    of land, the bearing and distance of the port must be found. This may be done by
                    Mercator’s or Middle Latitude Sailing; but the most expeditious method is by a
                    chart. If islands, capes, or headlands intervene, it will be necessary to find
                    the several courses and distances between each successively. The true course
                    between the places must be reduced to the course per compass, by allowing the
                    variation to the right or left of the true course, according as it is west or
                    east.</p>
                <p part="N">At the time of leaving the land, the bearing of some known place is to
                    be observed, and its distance is usually found by estimation. As perhaps the
                    distance thus found will be liable to some error, particularly in hazy or foggy
                    weather, or when that distance is considerable, it will therefore be proper to
                    use the following method for this purpose.</p>
                <p part="N">Let the bearing be observed of the place from which the departure is to
                    be taken; and the ship having run a certain distance on a direct course, the
                    bearing of the same place is to be again observed. Now, having one side of a
                    plain triangle, namely, the distance sailed, and all the angles, the other
                    distances may be found by Prob. I. of Oblique Sailing.</p>
                <p part="N">The method of finding tlιe course and distance sailed in a given time is
                    by the compass, the log-line, and halfminute glass. These have been already
                    described. In the royal navy, and in ships in the service of the East India
                    Company, the log is hove once every hour; but in most other trading vessels only
                    every two hours.</p>
                <p part="N">The several courses and distances sailed in the course of twenty-four
                    hours, or between noon and noon, and whatever remarks are thought worthy of
                    notice, are set down with chalk on a board painted black, called the <hi
                        rend="italic">log-board,</hi> which is usually divided into six columns; the
                    first column on the left hand contains the hours from noon to noon; the second
                    and third the knots and parts of a knot sailed every hour, or every two hours,
                    according as the log is marked; the fourth column contains the courses steered;
                    the fifth, the winds; and in the sixth the various remarks and phenomena are
                    written. The log-board is transcribed every day at noon into the log-book, which
                    is ruled and divided after the same manner.</p>
                <p part="N">The courses steered must be corrected by the variation of the compass
                    and leeway. If the variation is west, it must be allowed to the left hand of the
                    course steered; but if east, to the right hand, in order to obtain the true
                    course. The leeway is to be allowed to the right or left of the course steered,
                    according as the ship is on the larboard or starboard tack. The method of
                    finding the va-nation, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193829492?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0715-9492-0791"/>which should be determined daily if possible,
                    is given in the preceding chapter; and the leeway may be understood from what
                    follows.</p>
                <p part="N">When a ship is close hauled, that part of the wind which acts upon the
                    hull and rigging, together with a considerable part of the force which is
                    exerted on the sails, tends to drive her to the leeward. But since the bow of a
                    ship exposes less surface to the water than her side, the resistance will be
                    less in the first case than in the second; the velocity in the direction of her
                    head will therefore in most cases be greater than the velocity in the direction
                    of her side; and the ship’s real course will be between the two directions. The
                    angle formed between the line of her apparent course and the line she really
                    describes through the water is called the <hi rend="italic">angle of
                        leeway,</hi> or simply the <hi rend="italic">leeway.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">There are many circumstances which prevent the laying down rules for the
                    allowance of leeway. The construction of different vessels, their trim with
                    regard to the nature and quantity of their cargo, the position and magnitude of
                    the sail set, and the velocity of the ship, together with the swell of the sea,
                    are all susceptible of great variation, and very much affect the leeway. The
                    following rules, are, however, usually given for this purpose.</p>
                <p part="N">1. When a ship is close hauled, has all her sails set, the water smooth,
                    with a light breeze of wind, she is then supposed to make little or no
                    leeway.</p>
                <p part="N">2. Allow one point when the top-gallant sails are handed.</p>
                <p part="N">3. Allow two points when under close reefed top-sails.</p>
                <p part="N">4. Allow two points and a half when one top-sail is handed.</p>
                <p part="N">5. Allow three points and a half when both top-sails are handed.</p>
                <p part="N">6. Allow four points when the fore course is handed.</p>
                <p part="N">7. Allow five points when under the main-sail only.</p>
                <p part="N">8. Allow six points when under balanced mizen.</p>
                <p part="N">9. Allow seven points when under bare poles.</p>
                <p part="N">These allowances may be of some use to work up the day’s work of a
                    journal which has been neglected; but a prudent navigator will never be guilty
                    of this neglect. A very good method of estimating the leeway is to observe the
                    bearing of the ship’s wake as frequently as may be judged necessary; which may
                    be conveniently enough done by drawing a small semicircle on the tafferel, with
                    its diameter at right angles to the ship’s length, and dividing its
                    circumference into points and quarters. The angle contained between the
                    semidiameter which points right aft, and that which points in the direction of
                    the wake, is the leeway. But the best and most rational way of bringing the
                    leeway into the day’s log is to have a compass or semicircle on the tafferel, as
                    before described, with a low crutch or swivel in its centre; after heaving the
                    log, the line may be slipped into the crutch just before it is drawn in, and the
                    angle it makes on the limb with the line drawn right aft will show the leeway
                    very accurately, which, as a necessary article, ought to be entered into a
                    separate column against the hourly distance on the log-board.</p>
                <p part="N">In hard blowing weather, with a contrary wind and a high sea, it is
                    impossible to gain any advantage by sailing. In such cases, therefore, the
                    object is to avoid as much as possible being driven back. With this intention it
                    is usual to lie to under no more sail than is sufficient to prevent the violent
                    rolling which the vessel would otherwise acquire, to the endangering her masts,
                    and straining her timbers, &amp;c. When a ship is brought to, the tiller is put
                    close over to the leeward, which brings her head round to the wind. The wind
                    having then very little power on the sails, the ship loses her way through the
                    water; which ceasing to act on the rudder, her head falls off from the wind, the
                    sail which she has set fills, and gives her fresh way through the water, which,
                    acting on the rudder, brings her head again to the wind. Thus the ship has a
                    kind of vibratory motion, coming up to the wind and falling off from it again
                    alternately. Now the middle point between those upon which she comes up and
                    falls off is taken for her apparent course; and the leeway and variation is to
                    be allowed from thence, to find the true course.</p>
                <p part="N">The setting and drift of currents, and the heave of the sea, are to be
                    marked down. These are to be corrected by variation only.</p>
                <p part="N">The computation made from the several courses, corrected as above, and
                    their corresponding distances, is called a <hi rend="italic">day's work</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> and the ship’s place, as deduced therefrom, is called
                    her place by <hi rend="italic">account,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dead
                        reckoning.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">It is almost constantly found that the latitude by account does not
                    agree with that by observation. From an attentive consideration of the nature
                    and form of the common log, that its place is alterable by the weight of the
                    line, by currents, and other causes, and also the errors to which the course is
                    liable, from the very often wrong position of the compass in the binnacle, the
                    variation not being well ascertained, an exact agreement of the latitudes cannot
                    be expected.</p>
                <p part="N">When the difference of longitude is tobe found by dead reckoning, if
                    then the latitudes by account and observation disagree, several writers on
                    navigation have proposed to apply a conjectural correction to the departure or
                    difference of longitude. Thus, if the course be near the meridian, the error is
                    wholly attributed to the distance, and the departure is to be increased or
                    diminished accordingly; if near the parallel, the course only is supposed to be
                    erroneous; and if the course is towards the middle of the quadrant, the course
                    and distance are both assumed wrong. This last correction will, according to
                    different authors, place the ship upon opposite sides of her meridian by
                    account. As these corrections are, therefore, no better than guessing, they
                    should be absolutely rejected.</p>
                <p part="N">If the latitudes are not found to agree, the navigator ought to examine
                    his log-line and half-minute glass, and correct the distance accordingly. He is
                    then to consider if the variation and leeway have been properly ascertained; if
                    not, the courses are to be again corrected, and no other alteration whatever is
                    to be made on them. He is next to observe if the ship’s place has been affected
                    by a current or heave of the sea, and to allow for them according to the best of
                    his judgment. By applying these corrections, the latitudes will generally be
                    found to agree tolerably well; and the longitude is not to receive any farther
                    alteration.</p>
                <p part="N">It will be proper, however, for the navigator to determine the longitude
                    of the ship from observation as often as possible; and the reckoning is to be
                    carried forward in the usual manner from the last good observation; yet it will
                    perhaps be very satisfactory to keep a separate account of the longitude by dead
                    reckoning.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">General Rules for working a Day's Work.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Correct the several courses for variation and leeway; place them, and
                    the corresponding distances, in a table prepared for that purpose. From whence,
                    by Traverse Sailing, find the difference of latitude and departure made good;
                    hence the corresponding course and distance, and the ship’s present latitude,
                    will be known.</p>
                <p part="N">Find the middle latitude at the top or bottom of the traverse table, and
                    the distance, answering to the departure found in a latitude column, will be the
                    difference of longitude; or, the departure answering to the course made good,
                    and the meridional difference of latitude in a latitude column, is the
                    difference of longitude; the sum or difference of which, and the longitude left,
                    according as they are of the same or of a contrary name, will be the ship’s
                    present longitude of the same name with the greater.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193829505?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9505-0792"/>
                <p part="N">Compute the difference of latitude between the ship and the intended
                    port, or any other place whose bearing and distance may be required: find also
                    the meridional difference of latitude and the difference of longitude. Now the
                    course answering the meridional difference of latitude found in a latitude
                    column, and the difference of longitude in a departure column, will be the
                    bearing of the place, and the distance answering to the difference of latitude
                    will be the distance of the ship from the proposed place. If these numbers
                    exceed the limits of the table, it will be necessary to take aliquot parts of
                    them; and the distance is to be multiplied by the number by which the difference
                    of latitude is divided.</p>
                <p part="N">It will sometimes be necessary to keep an account of the meridian
                    distance, especially in the Baltic or Mediterranean trade, where charts are used
                    in which the longitude is not marked. The meridian distance on the first day is
                    that day’s departure; and any other day it is equal to the sum or difference of
                    the preceding day’s meridian distance and the day’s departure, according as they
                    are of the same or of a contrary denomination.</p>
                <p part="N">It will be found very satisfactory to lay down the ship’s place on a
                    chart at the noon of each day, and her situation with respect to the place bound
                    to and the nearest land will be obvious. The bearing and distance of the
                    intended or any other port, and other requisites, may be easily found by the
                    chart, as already explained; and indeed every day’s work may be performed on the
                    chart, and thus the use of tables superseded.</p>
                <p part="N">Specimens of a ship’s journal may be found in the works on navigation
                    already mentioned. The reader is also referred to these works for the traverse
                    table, and tables of meridional parts, log. rising, middle time, half elapsed
                    time, logarithmic difference, &amp;c. which have been employed in the solution
                    of the various problems.</p>
