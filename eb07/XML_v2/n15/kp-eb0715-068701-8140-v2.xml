                <p part="N"><label type="entry">NAIRNSHIRE</label>, a small county in Scotland. It
                    is situated between 57° 22' and 57° 40' north latitude, and 3° 47' west
                    longitude, having the Moray Frith on the north, Morayshire on the east and
                    south, and the county of Inverness on the west. Its extent from north to south
                    is from twelve to twenty miles, and from east to west from ten to thirteen; and
                    its contents are 198 square miles, or 126,720 English acres, of which only about
                    a fourth part is in cultivation, the rest consisting principally of waste and
                    moor ground, with about 8000 acres of wood, chiefly planted, about two square
                    miles of lakes, and a small proportion of moss. It has only four entire
                    parishes, Nairn, Auldearn, Cawdor, and Ardclach, and portions of other five,
                    which belong to the counties of Moray, Ross, and Inverness. Two detached
                    districts, Ferintoshand Dunmaglass, belong to Nairnshire; the former lying near
                    Dingwall in Ross-shire, and the latter at the head of Strathnairn in
                    Inverness-shire.</p>
                <p part="N">The sea shore of Nairnshire is low, bare, and sandy; and the approaches
                    to it from the Moray Frith are all beset by numerous sand-banks, especially from
                    Fort George to Whiteness Point, where the free channel is narrow, and the
                    navigation intricate and dangerous. To the eastward the sand has been drifted
                    into hillocks and even hills of sand, the parents, it is believed, of the great
                    sand floods which have buried the estate of Culbin, below Forres. Near to the
                    coast there rises to the height of about ninety feet a bluff terrace-bank, from
                    the top of which the country deflects back in several gentle undulations to the
                    slopes of the first chain of hills on the south side of the river Nairn, the
                    undulating plain being from one to four or five miles broad. The terrace-bank is
                    part of a general one which encircles the Moray Frith, and which, with the
                    waving cultivated grounds behind, consists of a great deposit of sand and
                    gravel, the rolled <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> in part of the ancient
                    mountains, and also, most likely, of the solid rocks which at one time filled up
                    the basin of the frith. Owing to this preponderance of sand in the subsoil, the
                    alluvial covering of Nairnshire is in general extremely slight, sandy, and
                    porous; and as the gravel beds are deep, rocks <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi>
                    are but seldom seen (with the exception, however, of some about the principal
                    town, and Boath, which form good building stones) till we reach the
                    south-western bank of the river Nairn. There the nearest chains of hills, which,
                    rising gradually from the east to an altitude, on the confines of
                    Inverness-shire towards the west, of perhaps 1500 feet, are skirted by a narrow
                    strip of the old red sandstone formation, with its associated coarse
                    conglomerate, dip beneath the gravel beds. Immediately behind, the whole
                    country, extending from the river Nairn to the Findhorn, and in one part beyond
                    it to Dutlιel in Strathspey, consists of primitive rocks, the only stratified
                    member of which is gray gneiss, with a few occasional beds of bluish granular
                    limestone. All the rest are varieties of granite, the most abundant variety
                    being a red or flesh-coloured and largegrained granite, which about Park is
                    beautifully porphyritic, with large crystals of felspar. All the rocks, as well
                    those of the sandstone deposits on the north, as of the primary masses in the
                    interior, exhibit undoubted and very extensive indications, in their shattered
                    and uplifted positions, of several great granitic eruptions having occurred at
                    different times.</p>
                <p part="N">On the Findhorn the scenery is in general wild and grand; the hills
                    above are moorish, lumpish, and unbroken in their outlines; the banks of the
                    Nairn, excepting the short distance they are enlivened by the contiguous
                    pleasure grounds attached to the several seats of Kilravock Holm and Contray,
                    are tame and uninteresting; but along the course of the streams traversing the
                    sandstone rocks, we meet scenes of simple picturesque beauty. Such especially is
                    the burn of Cawdor, which, for about two miles above the Castle of Cawdor, has
                    cut down the conglomerate rocks into most beautiful pyramidal curves, the deep
                    dell stretching around them being clothed with the most luxuriant vegetation,
                    from either side of which a fine old oak forest, and more recent plantations of
                    pines and oaks, cover for miles the lower slopes of the hills constituting the
                    beautiful grounds of Lord Cawdor.</p>
                <p part="N">Nairnshire cannot boast of a peculiar Flora; but some rare plants occur,
                    as potamogeton praelongus in Lochlee, and along with nymphaea alba in Loch
                    Littie; <hi rend="italic">gagea</hi> lutea and ranunculus auricomus near
                    Blackhills; carex vesicaria and lycopus europaeus near Millhill; salicornia
                    herbacea, teesdalia nudicaulis, and carex incurva, about Nairn; milium effusum,
                    festuca calamaria, convallaria majalis, lycopus europaeus, listera ovata,
                    goodyera repens, sco-lopendrium vulgare, lycopodium inundatum, about Cawdor.</p>
                <p part="N">The territory of Nairnshire, exclusive of the lands belonging to and
                    held of the burgh of Nairn, is divided into fifteen estates, of which nine are
                    under the valuation of L.500 Scots, other three under L.2000, and the remaining
                    three above L.2000. The valued rent is L. 15,062.15s. Id. Scots, of which about
                    one fourth is entailed. The real rent is now (1837) supposed to be fully
                    L.16,000. The principal residences are, Cawdor Castle, the Earl of Cawdor;
                    Kilravock Castle, Rose; Lethen House and Coulmony, Brodie; Kinsteary, Gordon;
                    Boath, Dunbar; and Geddes, Mackintosh.</p>
                <p part="N">This county is further subdivided into farms, in general small and
                    unenclosed. Although it is far behind the neighbouring counties of Moray and
                    Ross in its agriculture, yet the gradual introduction of the use of lime along
                    with the turnip husbandry is fast ameliorating the appearance of the cultivated
                    districts of the county. Its live stock presents nothing worthy of particular
                    notice; the cattle are generally small and puny, a sort of mongrel breed
                    intermediate between the Highland and the Morayshire, but inferior to both.</p>
                <p part="N">This county sends a member to parliament alontr with Elginshire; and the
                    town of Nairn joins with Inverness, Forres, and Fortrose, in the election of a
                    member for these burghs. The number of county electors is 116, and those of the
                    burgh amount to seventy-one. The counties of Elgin and Nairn are under the
                    jurisdiction of the same sheriff, who has a substitute for the latter county in
                    the town of Nairn.</p>
                <p part="N">Nairnshire formed a part of the ancient province of Moray. A few miles
                    to the east of Nairn, at a place called Harmuir, Macbeth, according to
                    Shakspeare, met the witches on his way to Forres. Near to the village of
                    Auldearn, Montrose obtained a great victory over the Covenanters in 1645. The
                    county contains the ruins of several castles, and other remains of an early age.

                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Nairn,</hi> the county town, and a royal burgh, is
                    a place of considerable antiquity, pleasantly situated on the northern bank of
                    the Nairn, near its mouth. It has no manufactures, and but little trade, and
                    contains about 2000 inhabitants. The National Bank and the British Linen Company
                    have opened branches here, and an academy has lately been erected by
                    subscription. Nairn has an excellent inn, with hot and cold salt-water baths;
                    and from the dryness and salubrity of the climate, it is much resorted to in
                    summer for sea-bathing.</p>
