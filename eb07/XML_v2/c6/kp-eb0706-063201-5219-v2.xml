                <p part="N"><label type="entry">CHROMATIC</label>, a kind of music which proceeds by
                    several semitones in succession. The word is derived from the Greek <hi
                        rend="italic">γ^ο&gt;μa,</hi> which signifies <hi rend="italic">colour.</hi>
                    For this denomination several causes have been assigned, of which none appears
                    certain, and all are equally unsatisfactory. Instead, therefore, of fixing upon
                    any, we shall offer a conjecture of our own, namely, that as χjw∕xα not only
                    signifies a <hi rend="italic">colour,</hi> but also a shade of a colour by which
                    it melts into another, or what the French call <hi rend="italic">nuance,</hi> so
                    the word in this sense is highly applicable to semitones, which being the
                    smallest interval allowed in the diatonic scale, most easily run into one
                    another. In order to learn the reasons assigned by the ancients for this
                    denomination, and their various divisions of the chromatic species, the reader
                    may consult the same article in Rousseau’s Musical Dictionary. At present this
                    species consists in giving such a procedure to the fundamental bass, that the
                    parts in the harmony, or at least some of them, may proceed by semitones, as
                    well in rising as in descending, which is most frequently found in the minor
                    mode, from the alterations to which the sixth and seventh notes are subjected,
                    by the nature of the mode itself.</p>
                <p part="N">The successive semitones used in the <hi rend="italic">chromatic</hi>
                    species are rarely of the same kind, but alternately major and minor, that is to
                    say, chromatic and diatonic; for the interval of a minor tone contains a minor
                    or chromatic semitone, and another which is major or diatonic, a measure which
                    temperament renders common to all tones; so that we cannot proceed by two minor
                    semitones which are conjunctive in succession without entering into the
                    enharmonic species, but two major semitones twice follow each other in the
                    chromatic order of the scale.</p>
                <p part="N">The most certain procedure of the fundamental bass to generate the
                    chromatic elements in ascent, is alternately to descend by thirds and rise by
                    fourths, whilst all the chords carry the third major. If the fundamental bass
                    proceeds from dominant to dominant by perfect cadences avoided, it produces the
                    chromatic in descending. To produce both at once, the perfect and broken
                    cadences are interwoven, but at the same time avoided.</p>
                <p part="N">At every note in the chromatic species, the tone must be changed; that
                    succession ought to be regulated and limited, for fear of deviation. For this
                    purpose it will be proper to recollect that the space most suitable to chromatic
                    movements is between the extremes of the dominant and the tonic in ascending,
                    and between the tonic and the dominant in descending. In the major mode one may
                    also chromatically descend from the dominant upon the second note. This
                    transition is very common in Italy; and, notwithstanding its beauty, begins to
                    be a little too common amongst us.</p>
                <p part="N">The chromatic species is admirably fitted to express grief and
                    affliction; and these sounds boldly struck in ascending are powerfully
                    effective. Their influence is no less magical in descending; it is then that the
                    ear seems to be pierced with real groans. Attended with its proper harmony, this
                    species appears proper to express every thing; but its completion, by concealing
                    the melody, sacrifices a part of its expression; and for this disadvantage,
                    arising from the fulness of the harmony, it can only be compensated by the
                    nature and genius of the movement. We may add that, in proportion to the energy
                    of this species, the composer ought to use it with greater caution and
                    parsimony, like those elegant viands which, when profusely administered,
                    immediately surfeit us with their abundance, as much as they delight us when
                    enjoyed with temperance and moderation.</p>
