                    behind, with a stool before. The chariots of the ancients, chiefly used in war,
                    were called by the several names of <hi rend="italic">bigae, trigae,</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">quadrigae,</hi> according to the number of horses used to draw
                    them. Every chariot carried two men, who were probably the warrior and the
                    charioteer; and we read of several men of note and valour employed in driving
                    the chariot. When the warriors came to encounter in close fight, they alighted
                    from the chariot and fought on foot; but when they were weary, which often
                    happened by reason of their armour, they retired into their chariot, and thence
                    annoyed their enemies with darts and missile weapons. These chariots were so
                    strongly built that they lasted for several generations.</p>

                    scythes,-with which whole ranks of soldiers were sometimes cut off when they had
                    not the art of avoiding the danger. These were not only used by the Persians,
                    Syrians, Egyptians, and other eastern nations; for we find them also among the
                    ancient Britons; and, notwithstanding the imperfect state of some of the most
                    necessary arts among that nation before the invasion of the Romans, it is
                    certain that they had war-chariots in great abundance. By the Greek and Roman
                    historians these chariots are described by the various names of <hi
                        rend="italic">henna,</hi><hi rend="italic">petoritum, currus</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">carrus, covinus, essedum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >rheda.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">henna</hi> seems to have been a chariot
                    designed rather for travelling than for war. It contained two persons, who were
                    called <hi rend="italic">comhennones,</hi> from their sitting together in the
                    same vehicle. The <hi rend="italic">petoritum</hi> seems to have been a larger
                    kind of chariot than the <hi rend="italic">henna,</hi> and is thought to have
                    derived its name from the British word <hi rend="italic">pedwar,</hi> signifying
                        <hi rend="italic">four,</hi> as this kind of carriage had four wheels. The
                        <hi rend="italic">carrus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">currus</hi> was the
                    common cart or waggon. This kind of chariot was used by the ancient Britons, in
                    time of peace, for the purposes of agriculture and merchandise; and, in time of
                    war, for carrying their baggage, and wives and children, who commonly followed
                    the armies of all the Celtic nations. The <hi rend="italic">covinus</hi> was a
                    war chariot, and a very terrible instrument of destruction, being armed with
                    sharp scythes and hooks for cutting and tearing all who happened to come within
                    its reach. This kind of chariot was made very slightly, and had few or no men in
                    it besides the charioteer, being designed to drive with great force and
                    rapidity, and to do execution chiefly with its hooks and scythes. The <hi
                        rend="italic">essedum</hi> and nWawere also war-chariots, probably of a
                    larger size and stronger make than the <hi rend="italic">covinus,</hi> being
                    designed for containing a charioteer to conduct it, and one or two warriors to
                    fight. The greater number of the British war-chariots seem to have been of this
                    kind. These chariots, as we have already observed, were found in great numbers
                    among the Britons; insomuch that, according to Caesar, Cassivelaunus, after
                    dismissing all his other forces, retained no fewer than four thousand
                    war-chariots about his person. Th⅛ same author relates, that by continual
                    practice they had arrived at such perfection in the management of their
                    chariots, that in the most steep and difficult places they could stop their
                    horses upon full stretch, turn them which way they pleased, run along the pole,
                    rest on their harness, and throw themselves back into their chariots with
                    incredible dexterity.</p>

                    observes that Josiah burnt those which had been offered to the sun by the kings,
                    his predecessors. This superstitious custom was an imitation of the heathens,
                    and principally of the Persians, who had horses and chariots consecrated in·

                    Curtius, speak of white chariots crowned, which were consecrated to the sun,
                    among the Persians and in their ceremonies were drawn by white horses
                    eonsecrated to the same luminary.</p>

                <p part="N">The Roman triumphal ehariot was generally made of ivory, and round like
                    a tower, or rather of a cylindrical figure. It was sometimes gilded at the top,
                    and ornamented with crowns; and, to represent a victory more naturally, it was
                    usual to stain it with blood. It was commonly drawn by four white horses; but
                    oftentimes by lions, elephants, tigers, bears, leopards, and dogs.</p>
