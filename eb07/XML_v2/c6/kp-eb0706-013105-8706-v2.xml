                    Spanish dominions in South America, bounded on the north by the Caribbean Sea,
                    from the Cape de la Vela on the west, to the point of Paria; on the east by the
                    sea, from the twelfth to the eighth degree of north latitude; on the south by
                    Dutch Guiana and Peru; and on the west by the kingdom of Santa Fé, another
                    obsolete division of the Spanish territory. The captain generalship of the
                    Caraccas is now incorporated into the modern republic of Colombia, to which the
                    reader is referred.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Caraccas,</hi> a large city of South America, and
                    the former capital of the above province, situated on that chain of mountains
                    which runs along the coast of the Caribbean Sea, from Coro to Cumana, above the
                    land of which it is situated at the height of three thousand feet. It stands on
                    a declivity near four streams, namely, the Guayra, the Anauco, the Caroata, and
                    the Catucho, which, after passing the town, join into one, and at length
                    mingling their waters with those of the Tuy, flow into the ocean thirty-six
                    miles east of Cape Codera. The streets are in general about a hundred yards
                    apart; and as they intersect each other at right angles, the whole town is
                    divided into square portions called quadras. There are several squares in this
                    city, of which the Plaza Mayor, or open square, is the most worthy of notice.
                    The east side is principally occupied by the cathedral, the south by the
                    college, and the west by the public prison. This square is a great market for
                    fruit and other articles, and contains a sort of inner square, in which are
                    ranges of shops. The town is well supplied with water from the Catueho, which is
                    dispensed to the inhabitants in public fountains, as well as in pipes and
                    reservoirs. The chief public buildings are the cathedral, which is two hundred
                    and fifty fcct in length by seventy-five in breadth, and is supported by
                    twenty-four pillars, without beauty or proportion. The church of Alta Gracia,
                    built by the people of colour, excels the cathedral in the richness of its
                    ornaments, and is by far the most splendid church in Caraccas. There are three
                    other parish churches, three monasteries for friars, two nunneries, and three
                    hospitals, of which one is for lepers alone. The college is the only public
                    institution for education; and the mode of education was a mere monkish routine
                    before the late revolution; but more liberal sentiments now begin to prevail.
                    The city contains, according to Dcpons, 40,000 inhabitants, composed of whites,
                    freed persons, slaves, and a few Indians. Caraccas, owing to its elevation,
                    enjoys a temperate climate; the thermometer in summer varying, about two o’clock
                    of the day, from 73 to 79. Long. 67. W. Lat. 10. 31. N.</p>
