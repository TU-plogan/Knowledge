                <p part="N">On its first introduction into Europe it was reprobated by many eminent
                    physicians, and at different periods long afterwards, it was considered as a
                    dangerous remedy; but its character, in process of time, became universally
                    established. For a number of years the bark, which was rolled up in short thick
                    quills, with a rough coat, and a bright cinnamon colour in the inside, which
                    broke brittle, and had an aromatic flavour, a bitterish astringent taste, with a
                    degree of aromatic warmth, was esteemed the best; though some considered the
                    large pieces as of equal quality. In the year 1779, the Hussar frigate took a
                    Spanish ship, loaded principally with Peruvian bark, which was much larger,
                    thicker, and of a deeper reddish colour, than that in common use. Soon after it
                    was brought to London, it was tried in St Bartholomew’s hospital, and in other
                    hospitals about town, and was said to be more efficacious than the quill bark.
                    This put practitioners upon examining into the history of the bark, making
                    experiments with it, and instituting comparative trials of its effects with
                    those of the bark in common use on patients labouring under intermittent
                    complaints. In July 1782, Dr W <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> illiam Saunders
                    published an account of this red bark, in which he says that the small quill
                    bark used in England is either the bark of the young trees, or of the twigs or
                    branches of the old ones, and that the large bark, called the red bark from the
                    deep colour, is the bark of the trunk of the old trees; and he mentions a Mr
                    Arnot, who had himself gathered the bark from the trees in Peru, and Μ.
                    Condamine, who gives an account of the tree in the Memoirs of the Academy of
                    Sciences at Paris for the year 1738; both of whom say, that, taking the bark
                    from an old tree effectually kills it, but that most of the young trees which
                    are barked recover, and continue healthy; and that, for these reasons, the
                    Spaniards now barked the younger trees for foreign markets, though they still
                    imported into Spain some of the bark of the old trees, which they esteemed as
                    much more efficacious than that which was obtained from the young. From these
                    accounts Dr Saunders concludes, that the large red bark brought to London in the
                    year 1779 was of the same kind as that used by Sydenham and Morton; as it
                    answers to the description of the bark used in their time, which is given by
                    Dale and other writers on the materia medica, who were their contemporaries. Dr
                    Saunders says, that it is not only stronger and more resinous, but likewise more
                    efficacious and certain in its effect, than the common bark, and that it had
                    cured many agues after the other had failed.</p>
                <p part="N">A species of cinchona has also been discovered in the West India
                    islands, particularly in Jamaica. It is accurately described by Dr Wright, under
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">CincĩiO' na Jamαicensis,</hi> in a paper
                    published in the Philosophical Transactions. In Jamaica it is called the
                    sea-side beech, and grows from twenty to forty feet in height. The white,
                    furrowed, thick outer bark is not used; but the darkbrown inner bark has the
                    common flavour, with a mixed kind of a taste, at first of horse-radish and
                    ginger, but becoming at last bitter and astringent. It seems to give out more
                    extractive matter than the <hi rend="italic">cinchona officinalis.</hi> Some of
                    it was imported from St Lucie in consequence of its <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193356090?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-6090-0699"/>having been
                    used with advantage in the army and navy during war; and it has been treated of
                    at considerable length by Dr Kentish, under the title of St Lucia Bark. The
                    fresh bark is found to be considerably emetic and cathartic, which properties it
                    is said to lose on drying.</p>
                <p part="N">The pale and the red are chiefly used in Britain. The pale is brought to
                    us in pieces of different sizes, either flat or quilled, and the powder is of
                    rather a lighter colour than that of cinnamon. The red is generally in much
                    larger, thicker, flattish pieces, but sometimes also in the form of quills, and
                    its powder is reddish, like that of Armenian bole. As already observed, it is
                    much more resinous, and possesses the sensible qualities of the cinchona in a
                    much higher degree, than the other kinds; and the more nearly these kinds
                    resemble the red bark, the better they are now considered. The red bark is
                    heavy, firm, sound, dry, and friable between the teeth; it does not separate
                    into fibres, and breaks, not shivery, but short, close, and smooth. It has three
                    layers; the outer is thin, rugged, of a reddish-brown colour, but frequently
                    covered with mossy matter; the middle is thicker, more compact, darker-coloured,
                    very resinous, brittle, and yields readily to the pestle; the inmost is more
                    woody, fibrous, and of a brighter red.</p>
                <p part="N">Practitioners have differed much with regard to the mode of operation of
                    the Peruvian bark. Some have ascribed its virtues entirely to a stimulant power.
                    But while the strongest and most permanent stimuli have by no means the same
                    effect with bark in the cure of diseases, the bark itself shows hardly any
                    stimulant power, either from its action on the stomach, or on other sensible
                    parts to which it is applied. From its action on dead animal fibres, there can
                    be no doubt of its being a powerful astringent; and from its good effects in
                    certain cases of disease, there is reason to presume that it is a still more
                    powerful tonic. To this tonic power some think that its action as an antiseptic
                    is tobe entirely attributed; but that, independently of this, it has a very
                    powerful effect in resisting the septic process to which animal substances are
                    naturally subjected, appears beyond all dispute, from its effects in resisting
                    putrefaction, not only in dead animal solids, but even in animal fluids when
                    entirely detached from the living body.</p>
                <p part="N">But although it be admitted that the Peruvian bark acts powerfully as an
                    astringent, as a tonic, and as an antiseptic, yet these principles will by no
                    means explain all the effects derived from it in the cure of diseases.
                    Accordingly, from no artificial combination in which these powers are combined,
                    or in which they exist even in a high degree, can the good consequences
                    resulting from Peruvian bark be obtained. Many practitioners, therefore, are
                    disposed to view it as a specific. If by a specific, however, we mean an
                    infallible remedy, it cannot indeed be considered as entitled to that
                    appellation; yet in as far as it is a very powerful remedy, of the operation of
                    which no satisfactory explanation has yet been given, it may with great
                    propriety be denominated a specific. But whatever its mode of operation may be,
                    there can be no doubt that it is daily employed with success in a great variety
                    of diseases. The remedial value of quinine, particularly in the form of a
                    sulphat, is known to every one, and will be fully explained in the proper
                    place.</p>
                <p part="N">This bark was first introduced for the cure of intermittent fevers; and
                    in these, when properly exhibited, it rarely fails of success. Practitioners,
                    however, have differed with regard to the best mode of exhibition; some prefer
                    giving it just before the fit, some during the fit, others immediately after it.
                    Some, again, order it in the quantity of an ounce between the fits, the dose
                    being the more frequent and larger according to the frequency of the fits; and
                    this mode of exhibition, although it may perhaps sometimes lead to the
                    employment of more bark than is necessary, is considered as upon the whole
                    preferable, from being best suited to most stomachs. The requisite quantity is
                    very different in different cases; and in jnany vernal intermittents it seems
                    even hardly necessary.</p>
