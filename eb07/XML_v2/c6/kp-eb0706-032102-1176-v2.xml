                    hieroglyphics of the ancient Egyptians.</p>

                <p part="N">That diversity of <hi rend="italic">characters</hi> used by several
                    nations to express the same idea is found the chief obstacle to the advancement
                    of learning. To remove this, several ingenious thinkers have taken occasion to
                    propose plans of <hi rend="italic">characters</hi> which should be universal,
                    and which each people should read in their own language. The object is to render
                        <hi rend="italic">character</hi> real, not nominal; to express things and
                    notions, not letters or sounds; yet to be mute like letters, and arbitrary, not
                    emblematical, like hieroglyphics. Thus, every nation would retain its own
                    language, yet every one would understand that of every other without learning
                    it, only by seeing a real or universal <hi rend="italic">character,</hi> which
                    should signify the same thing to all people, by what sounds soever it might bc
                    expressed in their particular idiom. For instance, by seeing the <hi
                        rend="italic">character</hi> destined to signify <hi rend="italic">to
                        drink,</hi> an Englishman would read <hi rend="italic">to drink;</hi> a
                    Frenchman, <hi rend="italic">boire;</hi> a Latin, <hi rend="italic">bibere;</hi>
                    a Greek, vr/w/v; a Jew, nnor; a German, <hi rend="italic">trinchen,</hi> and so
                    of the rest; in the same manner as seeing a horse, each people would express it
                    after their own manner, but all would mean the same animal.</p>
                <p part="N">The first and most considerable attempts at a <hi rend="italic">real
                        character,</hi> or philosophical language, in Europe, are those of Bishop
                    Wilkins and Dalgarno; but they <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> proved wholly
                    ineffectual. M. Leibnitz, indeed, thought that those ingenious men did not hit
                    the right method. It was probable, indeed, that by their contrivance people who
                    do not understand one another might easily have a commerce together; but they
                    have not hit on true <hi rend="italic">real characters.</hi> According to him,
                    the <hi rend="italic">characters</hi> should resemble those used in algebra,
                    which, in effect, are very simple, yet very expressive, without any thing
                    superfluous or equivocal, and contain all the varieties required. M. Lodwic, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> gives us a plan of <hi
                        rend="italic">an universal alphabet</hi> or <hi rend="italic">character</hi>
                    of another description. This was to contain an enumeration of all such single
                    sounds or letters as are used in any language, by means of which people should
                    be enabled to pronounce truly and readily any language; to describe the
                    pronunciation of any language that might be pronounced in their hearing, so that
                    others accustomed to this language, though they had never heard it pronounced,
                    should at first be able truly to pronounce it; and, lastly, this <hi
                        rend="italic">character</hi> was to serve as a standard to perpetuate the
                    sounds of any language.</p>
                <p part="N">A new universal character was proposed by Mr Northmore of London, by
                    which different nations might communicate their sentiments to each other. His
                    original plan <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351189?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0706-1189-0322"/>was to make the same numerical figure
                    represent the same word in all languages. But he found afterwards that it might
                    be improved by using a figure, not for every word, but for every <hi
                        rend="italic">useful</hi> word. And even these, he thinks, might be
                    abbreviated by adopting certain uniform fixed signs, the number of which would
                    not exceed twenty for the various parts of speech. Words of negation he proposed
                    to be expressed by a prefixed sign. A few instances will explain the author’s
                    meaning.</p>

                <p part="N"><hi rend="superscript"> li</hi> From the above specimen, I should find
                    no difficulty in comprehending the following sentence, though it were written in
                    the language of the Hottentots:</p>

                <p part="N">“Those languages which do not usc the pronoun prefixed to the verb, as
                    the Greek and Roman, may apply it in a small character, simply to denominate the
                    person; thus, instead of 9, 8, .5, <hi rend="italic">I never saw,</hi> they may
                    write 8, <hi rend="subscript"> g</hi>.5, which will signify that the verb is in
                    the first person, and will still have the same meaning.”</p>
                <p part="N">Our author thinks, that according to this scheme of an universal
                    character, about twenty signs, and less than 10,000 <hi rend="italic"
                        >choseiĩ</hi> words, synonyms being set aside, would answer all the ends
                    proposed; and that foreigners, by referring to their numerical dictionary, would
                    easily comprehend each other. He proceeds next to show how appropriate sounds
                    may be given to his signs, and an universal <hi rend="italic">living
                        language</hi> formed from the universal <hi rend="italic"
                    >characters.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">With this view he proposes to distinguish the ten numerals by ten
                    monosyllabic names <hi rend="italic">of easy</hi> pronunciation, or such as may
                    without difficulty run into one another. To illustrate his scheme, however, he
                    calls them, for the present, by their common English names, but suggests that
                    each number made usc of should be pronounced by uttering separately its
                    component parts, after the manner of accountants. Thus, let the number 6943
                    represent the word <hi rend="italic">horse,</hi> he would not, in the universal
                    language, call a horse <hi rend="italic">six thousand nine hundred and
                        forty-three,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">six, nine, four, three</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> and so on for all the words of a sentence, making the
                    proper stop at the end of each. In the same manner, a distinct appellation must
                    be appropriated to each of the prefixed signs, to be pronounced immedialely
                    after the numeral of which it is an appendage. Therefore, if <hi rend="italic"
                        >plu</hi> be the appellation or the sign of the plural number, <hi
                        rend="italic">six, nine, four, three, plu,</hi> will be <hi rend="italic"
                        >horses.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">“Thus,” says our author, “I hope it is evident that about thirty or
                    forty distinct syllables are sufficient for the above purpose; but I am much
                    mistaken if <hi rend="italic">eleven</hi> only will not answer the same end.
                    This is to be done by substituting the first twenty or thirty numerals for the
                    signs, and saying, as in algebra, that a term is in the power of such a number,
                    which may be expressed by the simple word <hi rend="italic">under.</hi> For
                    example, let 6943 represent the word <hi rend="italic">horse,</hi> and suppose 4
                    to be the sign of the plural number, I would write the word thus, and pronounce
                    it six, nine, four, three, in the power of or <hi rend="italic">under</hi> four.
                    By these means eleven distinct appellations would be sufficient, and time and
                    use would much abbreviate the pronunciation.”</p>
                <p part="N">3. Literal characters may again be divided, with reference to the
                    nations among whom they have been invented, into Greek characters, Roman
                    characters, Hebrew characters, and the like. The Latin character now used
                    throughout all Europe was formed from the Greek, as the Greek was formed from
                    the Phoenician; and the Phoenician, as well as the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic
                    characters, were formed from the ancient Hebrew, which subsisted till the
                    Babylonish captivity; for after that event the character of the Assyrians, which
                    is the square Hebrew now in use, prevailed, the ancient being only found on some
                    Hebrew medals, commonly called Samaritan medals. It was in 1091 that the Gothic
                    characters, invented by Ulphiľas, were abolished, and the Latin ones established
                    in their room.</p>
                <p part="N">Medallists observe that the Greek character, consisting only of
                    majuscule letters, has preserved its uniformity on all medals as low as the time
                    of Gallienus, after which it appears somewhat weaker and rounder. From the time
                    of Constantine to that of Michael we find only Latin characters; after the time
                    of Michael the Greek characters recommence; but from that period they began to
                    alter with the language, which was a mixture of Greek and Latin. The Latin
                    medals preserved both their characters and language as late as the translation
                    of the seat of the empire to Constantinople. Towards the time of Decius the
                    character began to lose its roundness and beauty; but some time afterwards it
                    retrieved, and subsisted tolerably till the time of Justin, when it degenerated
                    gradually into the Gothic. The rounder, then, and better-formed a character is
                    upon a medal, the fairer pretence it has to antiquity.</p>

                    or figures.</p>
                <p part="N">The Arabic character, called also the common one, because it is used
                    almost throughout Europe in all sorts of calculations, consists of the ten
                    digits, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8, 9, 0.</p>
                <p part="N">The Roman numeral character consists of seven majuscule letters of the
                    Roman alphabet, viz. I, V, X, L, C, D, M. The I denotes one, V five, X ten, L
                    fifty, C a hundred, D five hundred, and M a thousand. The 1 repeated twice makes
                    two, II; thrice, three, III. Four is expressed thus, IV, as I before V or X
                    takes an unit from the number expressed by these letters. To express six an I is
                    added to a V, thus, VI; for seven, two, VII; and for eight, three, VIII. Nine is
                    expressed by an I before X, thus, IX. The same remark may be made of the X
                    before L or C, except that the diminution is by tens; thus, XL <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193351202?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1202-0323"/>denotes
                    forty, XC ninety, and LX sixty. The C before D or M diminishes each by a
                    hundred. The number five hundred is sometimes expressed by an I before a C
                    inverted, thus, 13; and instead of M, which signifies a thousand, an I is
                    sometimes used between two C’s, the one direct and the other inverted, thus,
                    CIO. The addition of C and 0 before or after'raises CIO by tens; thus, CCIOO
                    expresses ten thousand, CCCIOOO a hundred thousand. The Romans also expressed
                    any number of thousands by a line drawn over any numeral less than a thousand;
                    thus, V denotes five thousand, ‰χ sixty thousand; so likewise M is one million,
                    MM is two millions, and so on.</p>
                <p part="N">The Greeks had three ways of expressing numbers: 1. Every letter,
                    according to its place in the alphabet, denoted a number, from α, one, to ω,
                    twenty-four. 2. The alphabet was divided into eight units, α one, <hi
                        rend="italic">β</hi> two, <hi rend="italic">γ</hi> three; &amp;c.; into

                    three hundred, &amp;c. 3. I stood for one, ∏ five, Δ ten, H a hundred, X a
                    thousand, M ten thousand; and when the latter ∏ inclosed any of these, except I,
                    it showed the inclosed letter to be five times its value; as, ∣∆∣ fifty, ∣II∣
                    five hundred, ∣X∣ five thousand, ∣M∣ fifty thousand.</p>

                    peculiarities by which each person is distinguished from others.</p>
                <p part="N">The poetical character is not properly any particular virtue or quality,
                    but a composition of several which are mixed together in different degrees,
                    according to the necessity of the fable and the unity of the action; there must
                    be one, however, to reign over all the rest, and this must be found, in some
                    degree, in every part. The first quality in Achilles is wrath, in Ulysses
                    dissimulation, and in AEncas mildness; but as these characters cannot stand
                    alone, they must be accompanied with others to embellish them, as far as they
                    are capable, either by hiding their defects, as in the anger of Achilles, which
                    is palliated by extraordinary valour; or by making them centre in some solid
                    virtue, as in Ulysses, whose dissimulation constitutes part of his prudence; and
                    in AEneas, whose mildness is employed in submission to the will of the gods. In
                    the making up of this union, it is to be observed, that the poets have joined
                    together such qualities as are by nature the most compatible; valour with anger,
                    piety with mildness, and prudence with dissimulation. The fable required
                    prudence in Ulysses and piety in AEncas; in this, therefore, the poets were not
                    left to their own choice. But Homer might have made Achilles a coward without
                    abating any thing from the justness of his fable; and it was only the necessity
                    of adorning his character that obliged him to make him valiant. The character,
                    then, of a hero in the epic poem is compounded of three sorts of qualities; the
                    first essential to the fable, the second embellishments of the first, while
                    valour, which sustains the other two, constitutes the third.</p>
                <p part="N">Unity of character is as necessary as the unity of the fable. For this
                    purpose a person should be the same from the beginning to the end; not that he
                    is always to betray identical sentiments, or one passion; but that he should
                    never speak nor act inconsistently with his fundamental character. For instance,
                    the weak may sometimes burst into warmth, and the breast of the passionate may
                    be calm; a change which often introduces into the drama a very affecting
                    variety: but if the natural disposition of the former were to be represented as
                    boisterous, and that of the latter as mild and soft, they would both act out of
                    character, and contradict their personality.</p>
                <p part="N">True characters are such as we actually see in men, or as may exist
                    without any contradiction to nature. No man questions but there have been men as
                    generous and as good .as AEneas, as passionate and as violent as Achilles, as
                    prudent and as wise as Ulysses, as impious and atheistical as Mezentius, and as
                    amorous and passionate as Dido. All these characters, therefore, are true, and
                    nothing but just imitations of nature. On the contrary, a character is false
                    when the author so feigns it that one can see nothing like it in the order of
                    nature in which he designs it shall stand. Such characters should be wholly
                    excluded from a poem, because, transgressing the bounds of probability and
                    reason, they meet with no belief from the reader. They are fictions of the pocťs
                    brain, not imitations of nature; and yet all poetry consists of an imitation of
                    nature.</p>
