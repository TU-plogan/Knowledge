                    side, by the Tivey; on the north it is divided from Merionethshire by the river
                    Dory, and from Montgomeryshire by an artificial boundary. The boundaries on the
                    east, between it and Radnorshire and Breconshire, are also artificial. On the
                    west it stretches along the sea-coast in a bending line, from north-east to
                    south-west, forming part of the shore of Cardigan Bay. Its extent, measured
                    along the shore, is nearly forty miles; its breadth does not average twenty. It
                    contains 726 square miles, or 464,640 acres, and is divided into five hundreds.
                    The market-towns are Aberystwith, Cardigan, Llanbodarnvawr, Llanbeder or
                    Lampeter, and Tregaron. The number of parishes, according to the last
                    parliamentary returns respecting the poor’s rates, is ninety-seven. It sends one
                    member to parliament, lies in the province of Canterbury and diocese of St
                    David’s, and is in the North Wales circuit. The coasts of Cardigan Bay (which is
                    formed by the projecting counties of Caernarvon on the north and Pembroke on the
                    south, with the eoasts of Merioneth and Cardigan in the centre) have, according
                    to tradition and appearance, suffered greatly from the depredations of the sea,
                    especially on the Cardigan shore. The tradition of the eountry is, that there
                    was formerly a sixth hundred, which is now covered by the sea; and there are
                    still to be seen at low water several ridges of rocks, ealled eauseways, which
                    seem to confirm the truth of this tradition. Of these the most remarkable is St
                    Patrick’s Causeway, which extends from within a mile of the point of Mochras,
                    south of Harlech, twenty-two miles into the sea, in a serpentine line. It is
                    formed of rough stones, twenty-four feet broad; and at the extremity there is a
                    round head, formed of sixteen great stones, onc of which is four yards in
                    diameter. Trunks and roots of trees are also found at a considerable distance
                    from the shore.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal rivers are the Tivey, the Rydiol, the Ystwith, and the
                    AEron. The Tivey rises in Llyn Teefy, or Tivey Pool, in a mountain in the
                    north-east of the county. On the top of this mountain there are five lakes, of
                    which Tivey Pool is the principal. It is about one mile and a half in
                    circumference, is surrounded by high and perpendicular rocks, and is said never
                    to have been fathomed. The Tivey at first flows through a rocky district;
                    afterwards, forming a regular channel, it passes Tregaron; and at Llanbeder it
                    becomes the boundary between Caermarthenshire and Cardiganshirc. It falls into
                    the sea about two miles below Cardigan. The Rydiol rises on the south-west side
                    of Plinlimmon; its eourse is about south-west; and it falls into the sea near
                    Aberystwith. About twelve miles above this town is the Devil’s Bridge, called by
                    the λVelsh Pont y Monach, or the Monks’ Bridge, and Pont ar Fynach, from the
                    confluence here of the Fynaeh with the Rydiol. There are two arches, one above
                    the other. The uppermost is between twenty and thirty feet in the chord, and the
                    other less than twenty. The upper one was built in 1753; the date of the
                    building of the lower one is not known. Near this bridge are the falls of the
                    Fynach. The first fall takes place where the river is much confined by the
                    rocks. The water is earried about six feet over them, into a basin eighteen feet
                    below. The next fall is sixty feet, the third fall is twenty, and the last is
                    110 feet. Near this is the fall of the Rydiol, the scenery around which is
                    considered as very striking and grand. The Ystwith rises among the hills on the
                    eastern side of the eounty, and falls into the sea at Aberystwith. The AEron is
                    between six and seven miles in extent, receives six tributary streams, and
                    forms, during the whole of its course, nearly the are of a circle. It falls into
                    the sea at Aberaeron.</p>
                <p part="N">That part of the eountry which lies along the sea is level, especially
                    the south-western extremity; but the'northern and eastern parts are very rugged
                    and mountainous. The soil of the low lands is either a light or a strong loam,
                    lying on slate. The soil of the mountainous division is in general thin and
                    poor, except in the narrow valleys, where it consists of clay or peat. The tract
                    along the sea-coast produces good crops of wheat, barley, turnips, potatoes, and
                    oats. The quality as well as the produce of the barley grown in some parts of
                    this tract is very remarkable. Between Aberaeron and Llanrysted is an extensive
                    flat, extending from the sea to the east mountains, which produces from sixty to
                    eighty bushels of fine barley per acre. This land is constantly under this
                    .crop, and has been so for at least half a century. It is manured every three
                    years with sea-weed. Potatoes arc grown on the peat mosses in such a manner as
                    at once to secure good crops and to drain the land. The potato sets are laid on
                    the surface of the bog, a little manure is spread over them, and they are
                    afterwards covered with earth dug out of the trenches.</p>
                <p part="N">Very few <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> shcep are kept on the low land,
                    but on the mountains they are numerous. They are in general the native breed,
                    and very inferior both for wool and carcass. Cattle are kept in alľ parts of the
                    eounty; in the low lands, and in the vales of the mountainous district,
                    principally for butter and eheese; in the other parts they are bred for the
                    English drovers. Of the 464,640 acres which this eounty contains, it is
                    calculated that 100,000 are in tillage, 145,000 in pasture, and the rest waste
                    land.</p>
                <p part="N">Cardiganshire was formerly famous for its mines of lead, but at present
                    they are not very productive; the principal are two in the vicinity of
                    Cwmystwith. Near Tal-y-bont are some that used to be very productive, but are
                    now almost exhausted; the matrix of the ore is carbonate of lime. There are also
                    veins of copper, but these are not wrought. The want of coal, of which there is
                    none in the whole eounty, the rugged nature of the country, and the badness of
                    the roads, are probably the chief causes why the mines arc not worked. Near
                    Aberystwith are large slate quarries; the slates lie in alternate strata with
                    shale, and are in compact masses, of a eoarse texture; the inclination of the
                    strata varies very much, following the general irregularity of shale. The slate
                    that is found near the seacoast, not being mixed with shale, lies in
                    perpendicular strata. There are some very extensive tracts of peat, especially
                    on the eoast beyond Aberystwith, bordering on the river Dovy; and from Strata
                    Florida, near the Tivey, to Llyn y Maes, or the Lake of the Flood; the latter
                    tract is one continued marshy bog, abounding in turbaries as far as Tregaron.
                    According to tradition, a town once stood in this marsh. As connected with the
                    natural history of this county, it may be remarked, that Mr Aikin observed, near
                    the banks of the Rydiol, a moor-buzzard, and the horse-ant, the largest species
                    of ants that are natives of Britain. The angel-fish is found in the bay of
                    Cardigan,.</p>

                <p part="N">There are few manufactures in this county; but at Llech-wydol, near
                    Cardigan, are iron and tin works. Black cattle, pigs, butter, barley, oats,
                    flannels, λVelsh webs, bark, iron, tin, slates, and ale, are exported from
                    Aberystwith and Cardigan. There is a great fair for cattle and sheep at Rhos,
                    near the source of the Tivey.</p>
                <p part="N">Cardiganshire is celebrated in the literary history of Wales for having
                    given birth to David ap Gwylim, who flourished between 1330 and 1370. From the
                    poems of this author, the modern literary dialect of Wales has been chiefly
                    formed, and this dialect is spoken with greater purity in the county of Cardigan
                    than in any other part of the principality.</p>
                <p part="N">In Cardiganshire a custom prevails resembling the penny-weddings among
                    the peasantry of Scotland. Before marriage a <hi rend="italic">bidder</hi> goes
                    from house to house inviting the inhabitants to come to the wedding, and to
                    bring money and cheese and butter. The marriage always takes place on the
                    Saturday, and the guests assemble on the Friday with thcir presents. All these
                    are set down on paper, that, if demanded, they may be repaid; but this seldom
                    happens. The furnishing of the woman is also brought home on this day. On
                    Saturday, ten or twenty of the man’s friends who are best mounted, go to demand
                    the bride, who is placed on a horse behind her father, and rides off as fast as
                    she can. She is soon, however, overtaken. Presents continue to be received on
                    the Saturday and Sunday; on Monday they are sold, frequently making, with the
                    money presented, the sum of L.50 or L.60. </p>
                <p part="N">In 1803 the poor’s rates amounted to L.10,l67; in 1815 there was
                    collected from 92 parishes L.15,409 8s. 6d.</p>
