                    animals whieh naturally seek and feed on flesh.</p>
                <p part="N">It has been a dispute among naturalists whether man is naturally
                    carnivorous. Those who take the negative side of the question insist ehiefly on
                    the structure of our teeth, which are mostly ineisores or molares; not such as
                    carnivorous animals are furnished with, and which are proper to tear flesh in
                    pieees, and to this it may be added, that, even when we do feed on flesh, it is
                    not without a preparatory alteration by boiling, roasting, or the like, and even
                    then it is the hardest of digestion of all foods. To these arguments Dr Wallis
                    subjoins another, whieh is, that all quadrupeds which feed on herbs or plants
                    have a long eolon, with a eaecum at the upper end of it, or somewhat equivalent,
                    which conveys the food by a long and large progress from the stomaeh downwards,
                    in order to its slower passage and longer stay in the intestines; but that, in
                    carnivorous animals, sueh eaecum is wanting, and instead of it there is a
                    shorter and more slender gut, and a quicker passage through the intestines. Now,
                    in man the caeeum is very visible; a strong presumption that nature, which is
                    still consistent with herself, did not intend him for a carnivorous animal. It
                    is true, the caeeum is but small in adults, and seems of little or no use; but
                    in a foetus it is much larger in proportion; and it is probable that our
                    customary ehange of diet, as we grow up, may occasion this shrinking. But to
                    these arguments Dr Tyson replies, that if man had been designed by nature to be
                    not carnivorous, there would doubtless have been found, somewhere on the globe,
                    people who do not feed on flesh; whieh is not the case. Neither are carnivorous
                    animals always without a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193348953?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0706-8953-0150"/>colon and caecum; nor are all animals
                    carnivorous which have these parts. The opossum, for instance, has both a colon
                    and caecum, and yet feeds on poultry and other flesh; whereas the hedgehog,
                    which has neither colon nor caecum, and so ought to be carnivorous, feeds only
                    on vegetables. Add to this, that hogs, which have both, will feed upon flesh
                    when they can get it; and rats and mice, which have large caecums, will feed on
                    bacon as well as bread and cheese. Lastly, the human race are furnished with
                    teeth necessary for the preparation of all kinds of food; from which it would
                    seem that nature intended we should live on all. And as the alimentary duct in
                    the human body is fitted for digesting all kinds of food, ought we not rather to
                    conclude that nature did not intend to deny us any?</p>
                <p part="N">It is not less disputed whether mankind were carnivorous before the
                    flood. St Jerome, Chrysostom, Theodore, and other ancients, maintain that all
                    animal food was then forbidden; which opinion is also strenuously supported
                    among the moderns by Curcellaeus, and refuted by Heidegger, Danzius, Bochart,
                    and others.</p>
