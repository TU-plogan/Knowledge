                    a distinguished African traveller, was born at Annan, in Dumfriesshire, in the
                    year 1788. His father was a respectable surgeon in the town where the subject of
                    this memoir was born, but having a very numerous family to support, the future
                    traveller received but an indifferent education. When able to do little more
                    than read and write, he was placed under a mathematical tcachcr, from whom he
                    acquired a knowledge of practical mathematics, including navigation and
                    trigonometry. At the age of seventeen he was bound as an apprentice on board a
                    large vessel which traded between Liverpool and North America, and in this
                    situation he continued for some years, distinguishing himself thus early by his
                    ability, coolness, and intrepidity. A circumstance which it is unnecessary to
                    mention here compelled him to change his berth in the merchant trader for one on
                    board a tender lying at Liverpool. From this vessel he removed to the Ċlorinde,
                    where his intelligence and activity soon raised him to the rank of midshipman.
                    In 1813, Clapperton, with a number of other young men of the same standing with
                    himself in the navy, were ordered to Plymouth dock-yard to acquire a knowledge
                    of the improved cutlass exercise, then newly introduced. When their own
                    instructions were completed, these individuals were distributed as teachers over
                    the fleet, and it fell to the lot of Clapperton to be appointed to the Asia, the
                    flagship of Vice-admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane. Early in 1814 this vessel
                    sailed for Bermuda, and, during the voyage, besides being distinguished as an
                    excellent drill sergeant, our future traveller, by his many excellent and
                    fascinating qualities, rcndcred himself beloved and respected by all on board,
                    including the admiral, who honoured him with his warmest friendship and
                    patronage. Clapperton, however, was ordered to the Canadian Lakes, then likely
                    to become the scene of important operations. Here he was promoted to the rank of
                    lieutenant, and soon afterwards to the command of a schooner. In the year 1817,
                    when the flotilla on the lakes was dismantled, hc returned to his native country
                    on half pay. But we must now hasten to view him in a new career, that of African
                    discovery, where hc has won for himself an honourable nichc in the temple of
                    fame; and where all those excellent and ennobling qualities of which we have but
                    the earnest, though a propitious one, in the naval officer, were to reach their
                    climax in the intelligent and enterprising traveller.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1820, Clapperton removed to Edinburgh, where he contracted
                    an intimacy with the late Dr Oudney. It was this gentleman who first directed
                    his attention to the cause in which both were destined to perish. After the
                    return of Captain Lyon from his unsuccessful attempt to penetrate through
                    Northern Africa, the British government determined to send out a second mission
                    for the purpose of exploring this quarter of the globe. Dr Oudney was appointed
                    to proceed to Bornou as consul, and Captain Clapperton went along with him as a
                    companion. Colonel Denham was also added to the expedition.</p>
                <p part="N">After having arrived at Tripoli, they set out early in 1822, in a line
                    nearly south to Mourzook, where they arrived on the 8th of April. Circumstances
                    having prevented them from proceeding any farther this season, Clappcrton with
                    his friend Oudney made an excursion to the westward of Mourzook, into the
                    country of the Tuaricks, which they penetrated as far as Ghraat, in the eleventh
                    degree of east longitude.</p>
                <p part="N">On the 29th of November, Clapperton, with his fellow-travellers, set out
                    for Bornou, and on the 17th of February 1823 reached Kouka, the capital of the
                    country. They were well received by the sultan; and here Clapperton and Oudney
                    remained until the 14th of December, when they set out for the purpose of
                    exploring the course of the Niger. The travellers arrived in safety at Murmur,
                    where Oudney breathed his last in the arms of his companion. The loss of this
                    enterprising individual was felt by Clappcrton as severe and afflicting in the
                    extreme.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193356415?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-6415-0724"/>
                <p part="N">Alone, however, he penetrated as far as Sackatoo, a large city in lat.
                    13. N. and long. 6⅜. E. which was the extreme point of the expedition in that
                    direction. Circumstances prevented him from proceeding to the Niger, which was
                    only five days’ journey to the westward. He accordingly returned to Kouka, where
                    he was rejoined by Denham, who scarcely knew him, from the ravages which disease
                    had made upon his frame. The two travellers then set out for Tripoli, which they
                    reached in January 1825, and from thence proceeded to England, where they
                    arrived on tire 1st of June.</p>
                <p part="N">The result of this expedition was a work containing the travels of
                    Denham, Clapperton, and Oudney; but it was not the fortune of the subject of
                    this memoir to see the publication of it. Immediately after his return he was
                    requested to take the management of another expedition to Africa, which he
                    accepted, and set out on the 27th of August 1825, in company with three other
                    individuals and Richard Lander his servant, an enterprising youth. On this
                    occasion our traveller landed at Badagry, in the Bight of Benin, and immediately
                    commenced his journey into the interior, along with Lander and two of the
                    individuals who had sailed with him from England. Both of them, however, soon
                    fell victims to the hardships of the journey. In January 1826, Clapperton
                    reached Katunga, the capital of Youriba, and soon afterwards crossed the Niger
                    at Boussa, the place where Park met his untimely fate. In July he arrived at
                    Kano, a city which he had previously visited. Here he left his servant with the
                    baggage, and proceeded alone to Sackatoo. It was the wish of Clapperton to
                    obtain permission from Bello, the sultan of Sackatoo, to visit Timbuctoo, and
                    revisit Bornou. But his plans were all frustrated in consequence of Bello having
                    engaged in a war with the schcik of Bornou. To the latter individual Clapperton
                    bore considerable presents from the king of England. Our traveller was detained
                    by bad health for several months at Sackatoo; but in the mean time the sultan
                    had privately inveigled Lander to join his master with the baggage, in order
                    that the presents might be intercepted; and Lander arrived at Sackatoo in
                    November, to the no small astonishment of Clapperton. The baggage was
                    immediately seized in the most shameless manner, and the travellers were
                    expressly prohibited from proceeding to Bornou.</p>
                <p part="N">For some months Clapperton enjoyed tolerable health, but on the 13th of
                    March 1827 he was suddenly attacked with dysentery. It is unnecessary to trace
                    the progress of the disorder which finally carried off this enterprising
                    traveller. He lingered on until the 13th of April, when he expired in the arms
                    of his faithful servant.</p>
                <p part="N">Although Clapperton failed in the main object of his ambition, which was
                    afterwards accomplished by his servant, he has done much to reform the geography
                    of Northern Africa. (See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Africa</hi> of this
                    work.) In stature Clapperton was tall; in disposition warm and benevolent; in
                    temper mild and cheerful. “No one,” says his servant Lander, “could be better
                    qualified than Captain Clapperton, by a fearless, indomitable spirit, and
                    utter-contempt of danger and death, to undertake and carry into execution an
                    enterprise of so great importance and difficulty as the one with which he was
                    intrusted. He studied the African character in all its phases; in its moral,
                    social, and external form; and, like Alcibiades, accommodated himself with equal
                    ease to good as well as bad fortune.” On the return of Lander to England he
                    published a work entitled “Records of Captain Clapperton’s last Expedition to
                    Africa,” which appeared in 1830, in 2 vols. 12mo.</p>
