                    an English Jesuit, was born at London, of indigent parents, in the year 1540,
                    and educated at Christ’s Hospital, where he had the honour to speak an oration
                    before Queen Mary on her accession to the throne. He was admitted as a scholar
                    of St John’s College in Oxford at its foundation, and took the degree of master
                    of arts in 1564. About the same time he was ordained by a bishop of the church
                    of England, and became an eloquent Protestant preacher. In 1566, when Queen
                    Elizabeth was entertained by the university of Oxford, he spoke an elegant
                    oration before her majesty, and was also respondent in the philosophy act in St
                    Mary’s Church. In 1568, he was junior proctor of the university. In the
                    following year he went over to Ireland, where he wrote a history of that
                    kingdom, and turned Papist; but being found rather too assiduous in persuading
                    others to follow his example, he was in consequence committed to prison. He,
                    however, soon found means to make his escape, and landing in England in 1571,
                    proceeded thence to Douay in Flanders, where he publicly recanted his former
                    heresy, and was created bachelor of divinity. Soon afterwards he went to Rome,
                    where, in 1573, he was admitted of the society of Jesus, and was sent by the
                    general of that order to Vienna, where he wrote his tragedy called <hi
                        rend="italic">Nectar</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Ambrosia,</hi> which was acted before the emperor with great applause.</p>
                <p part="N">From Vienna he went to Prague in Bohemia, where he resided in the
                    Jesuits’ College about six years, and then returned to Rome, whence, in 1580, he
                    was sent by Pope Gregory XIII. with the celebrated Father Parsons, to convert
                    the people of England. From Pitts we learn that, some time before, several
                    English priests had undertaken to convert their countrymen; that eighty of these
                    from foreign seminaries, besides several others who had been converted in
                    England, were actually engaged in the pious work with great success; and that
                    some of them had suffered imprisonment, chains, tortures, and ignominious death,
                    with becoming constancy and resolution; but seeing at last that the harvest was
                    abundant, and the labourers few, they solicited the assistance of the Jesuits,
                    requesting, that though not early in the morning, they would at least in the
                    third, sixth, or ninth hour, send labourers into the Lord’s vineyard. In
                    consequence of this solicitation, the above two were sent to England. They
                    arrived at Dover in an evil hour for Campian; and were next day joyfully
                    received by their friends at London. But he had not been long in England before
                    Walsingham, the secretary of state, being informed of his uncommon assiduity in
                    the cause of the church of Rome, used every means in his power to have him
                    apprehended, but for a long time without success. However, he was at last seized
                    by one Elliot, who found him in the house of Edward Yates, at Lyford, in
                    Berkshire, and conducted him in triumph to London, with a paper on his hat, on
                    which was written “Campian the Jesuit.” He was imprisoned in the Tower, where,
                    Wood says, he underwent many examinations, abuses, wrackings, tortures, and,
                    according to Pitts, <hi rend="italic">exquisitissimis cruciatibus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">tortus.</hi> It is to be hoped, for the credit of our
                    reformers, that this part of the story is not true. The poor wretch, however,
                    was condemned on the statute 25 Ed. III. for high treason, and executed at
                    Tyburn, with two or three of his fraternity. However criminal in the eye of the
                    law might be the zeal of this Jesuit for the salvation of the heretics of this
                    kingdom, biographers of both persuasions unite in giving him a great and amiable
                    character. “All writers,” says Wood, “whether Protestant or Popish, say that he
                    was a man of admirable parts; an elegant orator, a subtile philosopher and
                    disputant, and an exact preacher, whether in English or the Latin tongue; of a
                    sweet disposition, and a well-polished man.” Fuller, in his Church History,
                    says, “he was of a sweet nature, constantly carrying about him the charms of a
                    plausible behaviour, of a fluent tongue, and good parts.” His History of
                    Ireland, in two books, was written in 1570, and published, by Sir James Ware,
                    from a manuscript in the Cotton Library, Dublin, 1633, folio. He wrote also <hi
                        rend="italic">Chronologia Universalis,</hi> a very learned work; and various
                    other tracts.</p>
