                    composed of several letters interwoven, which are generally the initial letters
                    of the person’s names for whom the ciphers are intended. These are frequently
                    used on seals, coaches, and other movables. Anciently, merchants and tradesmen
                    were not allowed to bear arms; but in lieu thereof, they bore their ciphers, or
                    the initial letters of their names, artfully interwoven about a cross, of which
                    we find divers instances on tombs, and other monuments.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Cipher</hi> likewise denotes certain secret
                    characters, disguised and varied, used in writing letters containing some
                    secret, and not to be understood except by those between whom the cipher is
                    agreed on.</p>
                <p part="N">De la Guilletière, in his <hi rend="italic">Lacedaemon Ancient and
                        Modern,</hi> endeavours to make the ancient Spartans the inventors of the
                    art of writing in cipher. Their scytala, according to him, was the first sketch
                    of this mysterious art. The scytalae were two rollers of wood, of equal length
                    and thickness; one of which was kept by the ephori, the other by the general of
                    the army sent on any expedition against the enemy. Whenever those magistrates
                    meant to send any secret orders to the general, they took a slip of parchment
                    and rolled it close round the scytala which they had reserved, and in this state
                    wrote their instructions, which appeared perfect and consistent while the
                    parchment continued on the roll; but when taken off, the writing was maimed, and
                    without connection, though it was easily retrieved by the general upon his
                    applying it to the scytala in his possession. Polybius says that AEneas Tacitus
                    had collected together twenty different manners of writing, so as not to be
                    understood by any but those in the secret; and that part were invented by
                    himself, and part used before his time. Trithemius, Baptista Porta, Vigenère,
                    and P. Niceron, have written expressly on the subject of ciphers.</p>
                <p part="N">As the writing in cipher has become an art, so the reading or
                    unravelling thereof is called deciphering. The rules of deciphering are
                    different in different languages. By observing the following, any one may read a
                    common cipher written in English.</p>
                <p part="N">1. Observe the letters or characters that most frequently occur, and set
                    them down for the six vowels, including <hi rend="italic">y;</hi> and of these
                    the most frequent will generally be <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and the least
                    frequent <hi rend="italic">u.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">2. The vowels that most frequently come together are <hi rend="italic"
                        >ea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ou.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">3. The consonant most common at the end of words is <hi rend="italic"
                        >s,</hi> and the next frequent is <hi rend="italic">r</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">t.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">4. When two similar characters come together, they are most likely to be
                    the consonants <hi rend="italic">f, l,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> or the
                    vowels <hi rend="italic">e</hi> or <hi rend="italic">o.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">5. The letter that precedes or follows two similar characters is either
                    a vowel, or <hi rend="italic">l, m, n,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">r.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">6. In deciphering, begin with the words that consist, of a single
                    letter, which will be either, <hi rend="italic">a, I, o,</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">&amp;p</hi></p>
                <p part="N">7. Then take the words of two letters, one of which will be a vowel. Of
                    these words the most frequent are, <hi rend="italic">an, to, be, by, of, on, or,
                        no, so, as, at, if, in, is, it, he, me, my, us, we, am.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">8. In words of three letters there are most commonly two consonants. Of
                    these words the most frequent are, <hi rend="italic">the, and, not, but, yet,
                        for, thd, how, why, all, you, she, his, her, our, who, may, can, did, was,
                        are, has, had, let, one, two, six, ten,</hi> &amp;c. Some of these, and
                    words of two letters, will be found in every sentence.</p>
                <p part="N">9. The most common words of four letters are, <hi rend="italic">this,
                        that, then, thus, with, when, from, here, some, most, none, they, them,
                        whom., mine, your, self, must, will, have, been, were, four, five,
                        nine,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p part="N">10. The most usual words of five letters are, <hi rend="italic">their,
                        these, those, which, where, while, since, there, shall, might, could, would,
                        ought, three, seven, eight,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p part="N">11. Words of two or more syllables frequently begin with double
                    consonants, or with a preposition; that is, a vowel joined with one or more
                    consonants. The most common double consonants are, <hi rend="italic">bl, br,
                        dr,fl,fr, gl, gr, ph, pl, pr, sh, sb, sp, st, th, tr, wh, wr,</hi> &amp;c.;
                    and the most common prepositions are, <hi rend="italic">com, con, de, dis, ex,
                        im, in, int, mis, per, pre, pro, re, sub, sup,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >un,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p part="N">12. The double consonants most frequent at the end of long words are,
                        <hi rend="italic">ch, ld, lf, mn, nd, ng, rl, rm, rn, rp, rt, sm, st,
                        xt,</hi> &amp;c.; and the most common terminations are, <hi rend="italic"
                        >ed,</hi><hi rend="italic">en,</hi><hi rend="italic">er,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">es, et,</hi><hi rend="italic">ing, ly, son, sion, tion, able,
                        ence, ent,</hi><hi rend="italic">ment,</hi><hi rend="italic">full, less,
                        ness,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p part="N">By applying these rules, any common cipher written in English maybe
                    deciphered; and, <hi rend="italic">mutatis</hi><hi rend="italic">mutandis,</hi>
                    a cipher written in any language may be evolved by an application of the
                    principle on which these rules are constructed.</p>
