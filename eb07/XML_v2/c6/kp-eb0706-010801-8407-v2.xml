                    The origin of eaps and hats is referred to the year 1449, the first seen in
                    these parts of the world being at the entry of Charles VII. into Rouen; but from
                    that time they began to take plaee of the hoods, or chaperoons, whieh had until
                    then been used. When the eap was of velvet they ealled it <hi rend="italic"
                        >mortier,</hi> when of wool simply <hi rend="italic">bonnet.</hi> None but
                    kings, prinees, and knights, were allowed the use of the mortier. The cap was
                    the head-dress of the clergy and graduates. Pasquier says that it was aneiently
                    a part of the hood worn by the people of the robe, the skirts of whieh being cut
                    off as an eneumbrance, left the round eap an easy and commodious eover for the
                    head; whieh round cap being afterwards assumed by the people, those of the gown
                    ehanged it for a square one, first invented by a Frenchman ealled Patrouillet.
                    He adds, that the giving of the cap to the students in the universities denoted
                    that they had acquired full liberty, and were no longer subjeet to the rod of
                    their superiors; in imitation of the ancient Romans, who gave a <hi
                        rend="italic">pileus</hi> or cap to their slaves, in the eeremony of making
                    them free; and hence the proverb, <hi rend="italic">Vocare</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >servos ad</hi><hi rend="italic">pileum.</hi> Henee, also, on medals, the
                    cap is the symbol of Liberty, whom they represent as holding in her right hand a
                    cap by the point.</p>
                <p part="N">The Romans were many ages without any regular covering for the head.
                    When either the rain or sun proved troublesome, the lappet of the gown was
                    thrown over the head; and henee it is that all the ancient statues appear
                    bareheaded, excepting sometimes a wreath or the like. And the same usage
                    obtained among the Greeks, at least during the heroie age, when no eaps were
                    known. The sort of caps or covers of the head in use among the Romans, on divers
                    occasions, were the <hi rend="italic">pitra, pileus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >cucullus, galerus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">palliolum</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> the differences between which are often eonfounded by
                    ancient as well as modern writers.</p>
                <p part="N">The French elergy wear a shallow kind of cap called <hi rend="italic"
                        >calotte,</hi> whieh only covers the top of the head, and is made of
                    leather, satin, worsted, or other stuff. The red cap is a mark of dignity,
                    allowed only to those who are raised to the dignity of cardinal. The secular
                    clergy are distinguish^ ed by blaek leathern caps, the regulars by knit and
                    worsted ones.</p>
                <p part="N">Churchmen, and the members of universities, students in law, physie, and
                    others, as well as graduates, wear square caps. In most universities doctors are
                    distinguished by peculiar eaps, whieh are given them on assuming their degree.
                    Wiekliff calls the eanons of his time <hi rend="italic">bifurcati,</hi> from
                    their eaps. Pasquier observes that in his time the eaps worn by the churehmen
                    and others were called square eaps, though in effect they were round yellow
                    caps.</p>
                <p part="N">The cap is sometimes used as a mark of infamy. In Italy generally the
                    Jews are distinguished by a yellow eap, but at Lucea by an orange one. In
                    France, those who had been bankrupts were obliged ever after to wear a green
                    cap, to prevent people from being imposed on by them in any future transaction.
                    By several arrets in 1584, 1622, 1628, and 1688, it was deereed, that if they
                    were at any time found without their green cap, their protection should be null,
                    and their creditors empowered to cast them into prison; but the sentence is not
                    now executed.</p>

                    whom it was carried at the coronation and other great solemnities. Caps of
                    maintenance are also carried before the mayors of the several eities in
                    England.</p>

                    Straits of Sunda, which are supposed to be of voleanic origin. They are round in
                    their figure, and their sides are steep and have a naked appearanee. One of
                    them, the Cap, is penetrated by two large eaverns running horizontally into the
                    rock, whieh are famous for producing the edible bird-nests so highly prized by
                    the Chinese, and which constitute a great article of traffic. Long. 105. 48. E.
