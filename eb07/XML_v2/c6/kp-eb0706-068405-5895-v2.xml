                    eternal gratitude of all the lovers of learning. He was at the head of those
                    learned Greeks who brought into Italy the language of Athens, and reopened the
                    sources of erudition. Born at Constantinople, he was descended of an ancient and
                    distinguished family, whieh had removed with Constantine from Rome to Byzantium;
                    and he was sent by the emperor John Palaeologus to implore of the Christian
                    princes succours of men and money against the Turks. After an absence of some
                    years, Chrysoloras returned to Constantinople; but he did not remain long there,
                    as the magistrates of Florence had engaged him to accept of the. office of
                    professor of the Greek language in their city, where he opened his school about
                    the year 1393 or 1394, and taught three years. From Florence Chrysoloras passed
                    to Milan, and from Milan to the rising university of Pavia, to which he had been
                    invited by John Galeas, duke of Milan. When the death of Galeas in 1402, and the
                    troubles that broke out in Lombardy, forced hjm to quit Pavia, he retired to
                    Venice, where he lived several years, and subsequently went to Rome, upon the
                    invitation of Aretino, who had been his disciple, and who was then secretary to
                    Gregory XII. About this period Chrysoloras entered on the career of public
                    affairs. In 1408 he was at Paris in capacity of envoy from Manuel Palaeologus,
                    having been charged with an important mission by the Greek emperor. In 1413 he
                    accompanied cardinals Chalanco and Zabarella on a mission from Pope Martin V. to
                    the emperor Sigismund, in order to ehoose, in concert with the latter, a place
                    for the meeting of a general council, which had been demanded by this emperor.
                    Constanee was the town fixed upon, and thither Chrysoloras repaired, for the
                    purpose of assisting at the council as the representative of the Greek emperor.
                    But while he was preparing for the discharge of this duty, he was suddenly cut
                    off, on the 15th April 1415, in the forty-seventh year of his age. The works of
                    Chrysoloras are not numerous. The best known is his Greek grammar, published
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Erοte- .mαta</hi> or questions, of which
                    several editions, all now extremely rare, appeared in the fifteenth century. The
                    editions of Gourmont in 1507, of Aldus in 1512 and 1517, and of Juntus in 1514,
                    deserve to be particularly mentioned. Several letters and a tract on the pouring
                    out of the Holy Spirit are the only other known productions of Chrysoloras, and
                    the last still remains in manuscript.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Chrysoloras,</hi><hi rend="italic">John,</hi> was
                    the disciple and nephew of the preceding, not his son as some have supposed. He
                    is believed to have accompanied his uncle into Italy, and to have taught Greek;
                    but if so, he did not long follow this employment, for in 1415 we find that he
                    had returned to Constantinople, whither Guarini addressed to him a letter of
                    consolation on the death of Manuel. He was the master of Philelphus, who in 1425
                    married his daughter Theodora Chrysolorina; and he appears to have died about
                    the year 1427.</p>

                    supposed to have been born at Thessalonica, devoted himself chiefly to
                    philosophy and theology. Several of his works have been preserved in manuscript,
                    including a hundred letters to the emperor Manuel Palaeologus, a treatise on the
                    procession of the Holy Spirit, a dialogue against Demetrius Cydonius, and an
                    eulogy on St Demetrius. (See <hi rend="italic">JBibliotheca Graeca,</hi> tom.
