                    an electrician and natural philosopher, born at Naples on the 30th March 1749,
                    and son of a physician established in that city.</p>
                <p part="N">His father died when he was only eleven years old, but he received a
                    liberal education through the kindness of his friends, and completed his studies
                    at the university of Naples. He was originally destined for commerce, and came
                    to England in 1771, in order to obtain more complete information respecting the
                    various objects of mercantile pursuit. But he soon abandoned his intention of
                    adopting that mode of life, and determined to devote his time almost exclusively
                    to the cultivation of science, and to the literary employments connected with
                    it. The splendid improvements which had been lately made in electricity easily
                    directed his earliest attention to that amusing department of natural
                    philosophy; but his studies were by no means confined to that subject, and the
                    extent of his diversified researches may be understood from an enumeration of
                    his prineipal publications.</p>

                    apparently born to succeed in the highest flights of genius. Mr Cavallo’s
                    talents appear to have had more of the imitative character, and to have been
                    rather calculated for the attainment of excellence in the fine arts than in
                    science; but his memory was uncommonly retentive, and his industry seems to have
                    been indefatigable. He used to relate, that when he was first compelled to study
                    Euclid, he felt himself utterly incapable of comprehending the train of
                    argumentation, and he was obliged to get the whole work by heart, both
                    propositions and demonstrations, in order to impress the conclusions strongly on
                    his mind. This expedient answered his purpose very well, as long as the
                    impression lasted; but after some years he had forgotten his task, and he was
                    obliged to go through the whole again in the same manner, still finding it
                    easier to commit the eight entire books, with all the unmeaning letters of
                    reference, to the care of his ever-faithful memory, than to acquire the spirit
                    of the mode of reasoning, and to anticipate the steps of the demonstration;
                    although, after having performed this second labour, he felt himself
                    sufficiently master of the subject. It may be observed that he possessed
                    considerable skill in music; and music was called by the ancients an imitative
                    art, a description which may indeed be somewhat objectionable with regard to the
                    province of the original composer, who creates something altogether unlike what
                    had ever before existed, but which may not improperly be applied to the
                    occupation of a performer; indeed Mr Cavallo, even when his hearing was
                    impaired, still retained<pb break="no" facs="nls:193350318?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0706-0318-0255"/> a very correct taste in the execution of
                    vocal music. He possessed also his country’s aptitude for the painter’s art; and
                    he was particularly happy in cutting out striking likenesses of his
                    acquaintances in paper. The principal object of his life was to collect and
                    arrange the labours of others; and he was so much in the habit of collecting,
                    that he had for many years made it his amusement to collect specimens of the
                    handwriting of eminent persons, which he had extended to an immense number of
                    individuals of different ages and countries. But he was by no means incapable of
                    copying from the great book of nature; and he made, in the course of his various
                    researches, a number of original experiments, well calculated to illus-strate
                    particular questions relating to the sciences which lie cultivated. In the
                    latter part of his life he had discontinued his attendance at the meetings of
                    the Royal Society, as well as his contributions to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Transactions</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but he was in the habit of
                    frequenting some other literary conversations, at which he constantly met some
                    of his oldest and kindest friends. A short time before his last illness, he was
                    engaged in some experiments on Mr Deluc’s perpetual pile of paper, and on the
                    electricity of different specimens of crystals; but he docs not appear to have
                    obtained any new results from these investigations. He died at his residence in
                    Wells Street, on the 26th of December 1809, and was buried in St Paneras
                    churchyard, near the tomb of General Paoli, with whom he had long been on terms
                    of the greatest intimacy. <hi rend="italic">(Literary Memoirs of īΛving
