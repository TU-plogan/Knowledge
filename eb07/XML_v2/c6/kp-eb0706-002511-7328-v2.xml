                    Bundelcund, and province of Allahabad, situated between the 24th and 26th
                    degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the river Jumna, and on
                    the west by Bundelcund; but to the east and south its boundaries are not
                    distinctly defined. The country is mountainous. The river Cane runs through its
                    whole extent from south to north, and falls into the Jumna at Jana. Its
                    principal towns are Callinger, Senrab, and Attouah. The country produces ebony
                    and diamonds, a few elephants, much iron, and a quantity of cotton. This
                    country, from time immemorial, has been independent, until of late years. It
                    was, indeed, frequently overrun by the Afghans, Moguls, and Mahrattas, and
                    compelled to pay tribute; but the rajah still retained his fort and his title.
                    In 1022 he was at the head of the Hindu confederacy against the Mahommedans. In
                    1803 this district was ceded by the Mahrattas to the British, and was completely
                    subdued by their troops, when the rajah was forced to retire on a pension. The
                    natives are Hindus of the Rajpoot tribe.</p>

                    on the top of a lofty mountain, is five miles in circumference, and is well
                    supplied with water from several tanks which are inclosed within it. It is
                    surrounded by a thick wood, which, though it adds to its strength, renders it
                    unhealthy. This fort has been often besieged, but generally without success. The
                    celebrated Mahmoud of Ghizné attempted its capture in 1024, but without success;
                    and Lhen Shah, the Afghan who expelled the Emperor Humayon from the throne of
                    Hindustan in 1545, was slain in attempting to take it. From the want of a
                    battering train in the early periods of Indian history, it was found
                    impracticable to take so strong a fortress; and the siege was generally
                    converted into a blockade, though ultimately without success. A garrison of 5000
                    men would be required to defend the works. In 1810 the British laid regular
                    siege to the fortress, which had become a rallying point for all the banditti of
                    the country; but they were repulsed with great slaughter in an attempt to carry
                    this stronghold by storm. So intimidated, however, was the garrison by their
                    determined efforts, that they evacuated the place during the night. Since this
                    period it has been garrisoned by a battalion of native infantry and a detachment
                    of European artillery. There are famous<pb break="no"
