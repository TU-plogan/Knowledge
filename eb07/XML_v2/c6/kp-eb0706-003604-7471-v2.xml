                    sufficiently great to give an image on the wall. In proportion as the lens is

                    instrument for drawing in perspective; one of the many ingenious inventions of
                    Dr Wollaston.</p>
                <p part="N">If a piece of plain glass be fixed at an angle of forty-five degrees
                    with the horizon, and if, at some distance beneath, there be a sheet of paper
                    laid horizontally on a table, a person looking downwards through the glass will
                    sce an image of the objects situated before him; and as the glass which reflects
                    the image is also transparent, the paper and pencil can be seen at the same time
                    with the image, so that the outline of the image may be traced on the paper. The
                    image is an <hi rend="italic">inverted</hi> one. This is the simplest form of
                    the instrument, and may be constructed extemporaneously by fixing on a stand a
                    plain transparent glass, with its surfaces ground parallel, or a piece of
                    Muscovy glass, at an angle of forty-five degrees with the horizon; a card with a
                    small hole in it will serve as a sight for keeping the eye steady in one
                    situation whilst the pencil is traeing the image.</p>
                <p part="N">If there be a plain mirror at an angle of 22∣ degrees with the horizon,
                    and a piece of plain transparent glass be placed near it, at an angle of 22∣
                    degrees with the vertical, the rays from the object will be twice reflected
                    before they reach the eye; and consequently, on looking down through the
                    transparent glass, an <hi rend="italic">erect</hi> image is seen, and the peneil
                    may be drawn over the outlines of this image so as to leave a perspective
                    representation on the paper. This disposition is seen at fig 1, Plate CXLIV.,
                    where <hi rend="italic">hc</hi> is the mirror, <hi rend="italic">ah</hi> the
                    transparent plain glass.</p>
                <p part="N">As the image and pencil are at different distances, they cannot be both
                    seen in the same state of the eye. To remedy this, inconvenience, a convex glass
                    is used, of such focus as to require no more effort than is necessary for seeing
                    the distant objects distinctly. By means of this lens, the image will appear as
                    if it were placed on the surface of the paper. In fig. 1 <hi rend="italic"
                        >hd</hi> is a convex glass of twelve inches focus; at <hi rend="italic"
                        >c</hi> the eye is placed; <hi rend="italic">fghe</hi> is the course of the
                    rays proceeding from the object to the eye.</p>
                <p part="N">Those whose eyes are adapted to seeing near objects alone, will not
                    derive advantage from the use of a convex glass, but will require a concave
                    glass to be placed at <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> in the course of the rays from
                    the object to the reflecting surface. In fig. 2, <hi rend="italic">ih</hi> is a
                    concave glass placed in the above-mentioned situation: it is so disposed as to
                    be turned at pleasure into its place, as the sight of the observer may require.
                    Persons whose sight is nearly perfect may use either the concave glass placed
                    before the reflecting surface, or the convex glass placed between the paper and
                    the eye.</p>
                <p part="N">in the actual construction of the instrument, a prism is used instead of
                    a mirror and a plain glass. The rays from the object fall upon the surface <hi
                        rend="italic">hc of</hi> the prism, fig. 3. This surface <hi rend="italic"
                        >hc</hi> is inclined 22⅜ degrees to the horizon. The refractive power of the
                    glass allows none of the rays in this situation to pass out; they are all
                    reflected from the surface <hi rend="italic">hc</hi> to the surface <hi
                        rend="italic">ah,</hi> and from that to the eye. <hi rend="italic">ah</hi>
                    makes an angle of 135 degrees with <hi rend="italic">hc,</hi> and 221 degrees
                    with the vertical. The eye cannot see the pencil through the prism as it does
                    through a plain glass; therefore, in order that the pencil may be seen, the eye
                    must be so placed that only a part of the pupil may be above the edge of the
                    prism, as at <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> fig. 3; and then the reflected image will
                    be seen at the same time with the paper and pencil. There is a small piece of
                    brass perforated with a lwle <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> and moving on a ecntre,
                    fig. 2; this serves to keep the eye in onc position, as it must be, that the
                    image may be steady, and also to regulate the relative quantities of light to be
                    received from the object and from the paper.</p>
                <p part="N">The instrument," being near the eye, does not require to be large. The
                    smallest size which can be executed with accuracy is to be preferred, and is
                    such that the lens is only three fourths of an inch in diameter. Fig 4 shows the
                    instrument on its stand, and clamped to a board. The joint by which the prism is
                    attached to the stand is double. The whole instrument packs in a box eight
                    inches by two, and half an inch deep.</p>
                <p part="N">This instrument serves for drawing objects of all forms, and
                    consequently also for copying lines already drawn on a plain surface. If it is
                    required that the copy shall be of the same size as the original drawing, the
                    distance of the drawing from the prism should be the same as the distance of the
                    paper from the eye-hole. No lens will be necessary in this ease, because the
                    image and the paper, being both at the same distance from the eye, coincide
                    without the aid of a glass.</p>
                <p part="N">In order to have a redueed copy of a drawing, the drawing is to be
                    placed at a distance from the prism greater than the distance of the paper from
                    the eye-hole. If the distance is twice as great, a copy will be obtained in
                    which the lines are of one half the size of the lines in the original, and so in
                    proportion for other distances. A lens is necessary, that the eye may be enabled
                    to see at two different distances; and, in order that one lens may serve, the
                    distance between the eye-hole and the paper should be variable; to that effect
                    the stand is susceptible of being lengthened or shortened at pleasure.</p>

                <p part="N">The length of the stem is adjusted upon optical principles. When a
                    distant object is to be delineated, the rays coming from it, and reflected by
                    the instrument to the eye, are parallel, and it is required that the rays
                    proceeding from the paper to the eye should also be parallel. This is
                    accomplished by interposing a lens between the paper and the eye, with its
                    principal focus on the paper. When the object to be delineated is so near that
                    the rays which come from it to the eye are divergent, then it is required that
                    the rays from the paper should likewise be divergent in the same degree, in
                    order that the paper and the image may both be seen distinctly by the same eye;
                    for this purpose the lens must be placed at a distance from the paper less than
                    the distance of its principal focus. The stem of the instrument is marked at
                    certain distances, to which the conjugate foci are in the several proportions of
                    2, 3, 4, &amp;c. to I, so that distinct vision may be obtained in all cases by
                    placing the original drawing more distant.</p>
                <p part="N">If the convex lcns be transposed to the front of the prism, and the
                    proportional distances bc reversed, a magnified image of the object will be
                    obtained.</p>
                <p part="N">This instrument has deservedly come into use. Its advantages, when
                    compared with tĥc camera obscura, are, <hi rend="italic">ist,</hi> That it is

                    30 or 35 degrees at most. The specification of Dr Wollaston’s patent for the
                    camera lucida is inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Repertory of Arts,</hi> vol.

                <p part="N">The camera lucida employed by Captain Hall packs in a small box. When
                    the instrument is to be used the box folds out and forms a small table, which is
                    fixed on the top of a tripod. There is a folding three-legged seat, which packs
                    within the tripod. The tripod, when closed and containing the seat, is only the
                    size of a walking stick.</p>
                <p part="N">If the camera lucida be fixed at the eye-glass of a telescope, it will
                    reflect to the eye the image <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the objects in the field
                    of the telescope, so that a drawing of the image may be made. See Dr Brewster’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Account of some Philosophical Instruments.</hi> A plain
                    reflecting glass, fixed at an angle of 45 degrees with the horizon, and placed
                    so as to receive the rays from the eye-glass of a telescope, will also give an
                    image of the objects in the field, so situated that the image may be traced with
                    a pencil. Varley’s patent graphic telescope is upon this principle. In order
                    that the field may be large, the magnifying power of the telescope should be
                    small.</p>
                <p part="N">• The inherent qualities of all the instruments for drawing in
                    perspective being closely allied, it will be proper to say something of the
                    principles on which these instruments are formed, and to mention some that are
                    not described in other parts of this work.</p>
                <p part="N">To make a perspective drawing of an object is to lay down on paper a
                    section of the perspective cone, whose apex is at the eye, and whose base is the
                    object. An experienced draughtsman can draw the figure of this section without
                    the aid of instruments. Others who have not acquired the facility of drawing the
                    image they see, must have recourse either to <hi rend="italic">measurement,</hi>
                    or to <hi rend="italic">instruments which bring the image under the
                    pencil.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Drawing by measurement is performed by actually measuring the height of
                    the principal parts of the object, and their horizontal distance from the eye;
                    together with the distance of the paper from the eye; and from these dimensions
                    the drawing is constructed by the systematic rules of perspective.</p>
                <p part="N">Another mode of obtaining a drawing by measurement is to measure the
                    angles at the eye. Suited to this purpose are theodolites, astronomical
                    quadrants, or other instruments capable of measuring vertical and azimuthal
                    angles at the eye. ∙ The angles to be measured are, the angles of altitude, and
                    the angles of azimuth, between the point of sight and the principal points of
                    the object; and if the tangents of the azimuthal angles be laid down with a
                    radius equal to the distance of the paper from the eye, and the tangents of the
                    angles of altitude with a radius equal to the distance of the paper multiplied
                    by the secant of the azimuth, the situation <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    principal points of the drawing will be determined. Or, if the instrument is
                    capable of measuring angles in any plane, the angles between the principal
                    points of the object and the point of sight are to be observed, and the
                    azimuthal angles of these principal points with the point of sight; and the
                    tangents of both are to be laid down on the paper, with a radius equal to the
                    distance of the paper from the eye.</p>
                <p part="N">But these two modes by measurement are long, particularly the first.
                    Usually, therefore, the instruments to which recourse is had for facilitating
                    the operation of drawing, are such as give an image or section of the
                    perspective cone on a plain surface, so that the pencil maybe drawn over the
                    outline of the image. These instruments may be considered under two heads; the
                    first comprehending those in which the pencil is immediately drawn over the
                    lines of the image; the second those in which the pencil has a motion parallel
                    to that of the point which moves over the lines of the image.</p>
                <p part="N">Of the first kind are the following. 1. The tracing pane, a very simple
                    and convenient instrument, consisting in a transparent plate of plain ground
                    glass, or of Muscovy glass, placed vertically between the object and the eye;
                    whilst the eye is kept fixed by a sight, the outline of the image is drawn on
                    the glass with Indian ink. 2. Or the upright glass may be divided into small
                    squares by lines crossing each other, and the paper on which the drawing is to
                    be made being similarly divided, the particular intersections on the glass that
                    cover the principal points of the object are observed, and these points are laid
                    down on the corresponding intersections on the paper. 3. The image seen in a
                    plain mirror may also be drawn on its surface with Indian ink. 4. In the camera
                    obscura, different forms of which are described in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Encyclopoedia</hi> under the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Dioptrics</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> the image to be drawn is formed at the
                    focus of a lens. 5. In the camera lucida the reflected image is used.</p>
                <p part="N">In the second division of the instruments which give a Section of the
                    perspective cone susceptible of being delineated, the pencil does not move
                    immediately over the lines of the image, but moves parallel to these lines. 1.
                    There is a rod which can be moved in all directions, consistent with its
                    remaining parallel to itself. If one extremity of this rod be moved in space
                    over the outlines of the image which the eye sees, a pencil at the other
                    extremity will necessarily move with a similar motion, and form a drawing of the
                    object on paper. In Sir Christopher Wren’s instrument, of which he has given the
                    description and figure in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi>
                    vol. iv., the rod is suspended by strings passing over pullies, and the ends of
                    the strings are fixed to a counterpoise. On a similar principle' is Peacock’s
                    instrument, described in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi>

                    The pencil may delineate the base of a cone similar and opposite to
                    the-perspective cone. If the rays from the extreme points of an object cross on
                    the ray from the centre, as they do in passing through a small hole into a dark
                    room, and if it be supposed that, in the place of one of the rays a slender
                    inflexible rod is substituted movable on a centre at the hole, when this rod is
                    moved so that its outer extremity goes over the outlines of the external image,
                    a pencil fixed to its inner extremity will form an inverted drawing of the
                    object. Of this nature is the op-tigraph of Ramsden and Thomas Jones, described
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine.,</hi> vol. xxviii. 1807, p. 67.
                    The image of the object is seen in a telescope. There is a piece of plain glass
                    near <hi rend="italic">c</hi> in the focus of the eye-glass of the telescope F,
                    fig. 5. On the centre of this piece of glass is a dot; <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    is a plain mirror, inclined so as to reflect the image of the object down into
                    the telescope. This mirror remains fixed, whilst the telescope is movable on a
                    universal joint at its object-glass <hi rend="italic">l&gt;.</hi> Near <hi
                        rend="italic">c</hi> is another plain mirror, which reflects the rays to the
                    eye-glass. The eye being placed at the eye-glass at e, the telescope is to be
                    moved by the handle Λ, so that the dot in the focus of the eye-glass shall pass
                    over the outlines of the image seen by the eye, and the pencil at L performing a
                    similar motion to that of the dot, and sliding freely in its sheath, presses
                    with its weight on the paper: a drawing of the object is the result. If the
                    stand and slider H be lengthened, an enlarged drawing will be obtained. The
                    instrument packs in a box 14 inches by 6 and 3.</p>
                <p part="N">The instrument used for drawing profiles of the face consists of a long
                    rod which moves on a joint. One end of the rod is moved over the face, the other
                    end, which terminates in an iron point, describes the profile on paper.
                    Professor Wallace of Edinburgh has constructed an improved drawing instrument,
                    which will be described under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Eidograph.</hi>
                    It is of the nature of the pento-graph, and serves for copying and reducing. <hi

                        rend="italic">Obscura,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Park Chamber,</hi> in <hi
                        rend="italic">Optics,</hi> a machine or apparatus representing an artificial
                    eye, by which the images of external objects, received through a double convex
                    glass, arc exhibited distinctly, and in their native colours, on a white matter
                    placed within the machine, in the focus of the glass. The first invention of
                    this instrument is ascribed to Baptista Porta.</p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">camera obscura</hi> affords very diverting
                    spectacles; both by exhibiting images perfectly like their objects, each being
                    clothed in its native colours, and by expressing, at the same time, all their
                    motions, which n∙o other art can <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> imitate. By means
                    of this instrument, a person unacquainted with designing will be able to
                    delineate objects with the greatest accuracy and justness, and another well
                    versed in painting will find in it many things to perfect his art.</p>
