                    archipelago, situated between Java and Borneo, and extending from about 2° north
                    to 6° south latitude, and from 119° to 125° east longitude. It is of the most
                    irregular form, consisting of four long peninsulas united togetheι at a central
                    point. It was first discovered by the Portuguese in 1525. In 1660 that people
                    were driven out by the Dαteh, who had to sustain a long series of contests with
                    the natives, till in 1699 they succeeded in forming a permanent settlement.
                    Their principal establishment has always been Fort Rotterdam, at Macassar, on
                    the western coast of the island, situated in 5° 9' south latitude, and 119°
                    48’east longitude. The fort is about eight hundred feet from the sea, and is
                    well fortified with high and strong walls. The town lies on a plain to the
                    north, and is tolerably built, and the streets are broad, erossing each other at
                    right angles. The trade is not considerable, the eountry affording few articles
                    of export exeept rice and a number of slaves for the supply of Java. The chief
                    object of the Dutch in making this settlement was to secure their communication
                    with the Spice Islands. They had repeated at-taeks to sustain from the rajah of
                    Macassar, whose power in 1778 they finally subverted, and transferred the
                    superiority to their ally, the rajah of Bony. His territory is situated round
                    the great bay on the southern coast, called the Bay of Bony, Sewa, or Buggess.
                    The inhabitants are termed Bonginese, or Bonnians, corrupted by the English into
                    Buggesses. These are a very remarkable people, and possess many excellent
                    qualities. In a manuscript account which we have seen, written by a gentleman
                    long resident in this part of India, they are considered as by much the most
                    meritorious of the inhabitants of the East India islands. They manufacture the
                    cotton of their own country, and of Java, into a species of cloths, whieh, from
                    their superior quality, are in universal demand throughout the archipelago.
                    Their permanent residence he states to be around a great lake in the interior,
                    whieh they leave at the commencement of the season favourable for navigation.
                    They then sail down a river into the Bay of Bony, whence they spread themselves
                    over all the neighbouring seas. There is not a coast from the extremity of New
                    Holland to the Malay peninsula in whieh their prows are not habitually seen.
                    Besides exchanging their own commodities for those of their neighbours, they act
                    as caιτiers between the countries that lie remote from each other. Our informant
                    describes their conduct as traders to be not less upright and honourable than it
                    is active and enterprising. They defend themselves and their property against
                    the attacks of the Malay pirates with the most heroic and desperate valour.
                    Major Thorn, in his <hi rend="italic">Account of Java,</hi> mentions an instance
                    in which a Bonginese crew, being overcome and boarded, fired a barrel of
                    gunpowder whieh was on board, and thus blew up at once themselves and their
                    assailants.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1814 the rajah of Bony being considered inimical to the British
                    government, an expedition was sent against him from Java under General
                    Nightingale. It arrived at Maeassar on the 7th of June, and immediately landed.
                    The British force, led by Colonel Maeleod, attacked the town and palace, and
                    carried them in about an hour, though with some loss, the rajah escaping into
                    the interior of his dominions. A new government was then established; but the
                    revolution in Europe has, we believe, restored this settlement to the Dutch, its
                    former possessors.</p>
                <p part="N">The interior of Celebes, and the remainder of its coasts, are almost
                    entirely unknown. The great bay of Gonong Zello, on the east eoast, presents
                    many natural advantages. Gold is exported from its coasts, and the amount is
                    said to be capable of almost indefinite augmentation. Tortoise shell is likewise
                    produced in considerable quantity. Bentham Bay, to the south-east of Maeassar,
                    has a fort and some trade. The country around produces excellent rice.</p>
                <p part="N">The exports are nearly similar to those of Borneo. Gold <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193350526?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-0526-0271"/>is found,
                    as there, in alluvial soil, washed down by the rivers. Sometimes even springs,
                    slightly impregnated; with that metal, issue from the rocks. The total value of
                    the gold exported is estimated by Mr Hamilton at L.120,000. The cotton cloths
                    manufactured in Celebes, called <hi rend="italic">camhays,</hi> are universally
                    worn throughout the Indian islands; but their use does not extend farther. The
                    imports coincide precisely with those of Borneo. <hi rend="smallcaps"
