                    of the tombs of St Peter and St Paul; and Μ. Chastelain observes, that, among
                    the more intelligent of the people of Rome, the word <hi rend="italic"
                        >catacomb</hi> is never applied to the subterranean burying-places
                    hereinafter mentioned, but only to a chapel in St Sebastian, one <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> the seven stational churches, where, the ancient Roman
                    calendars say, the body of St Peter was deposited, under the consulate of Tuscus
                    and Bassus, in 258.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Catacombs</hi> of Italy, a vast assemblage of
                    subterranean sepulchres near Rome, chiefly about three miles from that city, in
                    the Via Appia; supposed to be the sepulchres of the martyrs, and which are
                    accordingly visited by devotees, and relics thence taken and dispersed
                    throughout the Catholic countries, after having been first baptized by the pope
                    under the name of some saint. These <hi rend="italic">catacombs</hi> are said by
                    many to be caves or cells in which the primitive Christians held their
                    interdicted assemblies, and where they interred such of their number as were
                    martyred. Each <hi rend="italic">catacomb</hi> is three feet broad and eight or
                    ten feet high, running in form of an alley or gallery, and communicating with
                    others. In many places they extend within a league of Rome. There is no masonry
                    or vaulting in them, but each supports itself; and the two sides, which we may
                    look on as the <hi rend="italic">parietes</hi> or walls, were the places where
                    the dead were deposited lengthwise, three or four rows, one above another, in
                    the same <hi rend="italic">catacomb,</hi> parallel to the alley. They were
                    commonly closed with large thick tiles, and sometimes pieces of marble cemented
                    in a manner which the moderns have failed to imitate. Sometimes, though very
                    rarely, the name of the deceased is found on the tile; frequently a palm is
                    seen, painted or engraven, or the cipher Xp, which is commonly read <hi
                        rend="italic">pro Christo.</hi> The opinion entertained by many Protestant
                    authors is, that the <hi rend="italic">catacombs</hi> are heathen sepulchres,
                    being the same with the <hi rend="italic">puticuli</hi> mentioned by Festus
                    Pompeius; that although it was the practice of the ancient Romans to burn their
                    dead, they, in order to avoid expense, threw the bodies of their slaves to rot
                    in holes of the ground; that the Roman Christians, observing at length the great
                    veneration paid to relics, resolved to have a stock of their own; and that,
                    entering the <hi rend="italic">catacombs,</hi> they added what ciphers and
                    inscriptions they pleased, and then shut them up again, to be opened on a
                    favourable occasion; while those in the secret dying or removing, the
                    contrivance was forgotten, till chance opened them at last. But this opinion has
                    even less of probability than the former. Mr Monro, in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Philosophical Transactions,</hi> supposes the <hi rend="italic"
                        >catacombs</hi> to have been originally the common sepulchres of the early
                    Romans, and excavated in consequence of the belief that shades hate the light,
                    and that they love to hover about the places where the bodies are laid.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Catacombs</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">of Egypt</hi> are still extant, and have been described by
                    various travellers, particularly by Belzoni. The bodies found in them are called
                    mummies. The chambers containing these extend a great way under ground. In some
                    of the chambers the walls are adorned with figures and hieroglyphics; in others
                    the mummies are found in tombs ranged around the apartment, and hollowed out in
                    the rock.</p>
                <p part="N">The Egyptians seem to have excelled in the art of embalming and
                    preserving their dead bodies, as the mummies found in the catacombs of Egypt are
                    in a better state than the bodies found either in the Italian catacombs or in
                    those of any other part of the world.</p>
                <p part="N">Depositing the bodies of the dead in caves is certainly the original way
                    of disposing of corpses, and appears to have been introduced by the Phoenicians
                    in the countries to which they sent colonies; interment, as now practised in the
                    open air or in temples, was first introduced by the Christians. When an ancient
                    hero died, or was Killed in a foreign expedition, as his body was liable to
                    conuption, and for that reason unfit to be transported entire, they fell on the
                    expedient of burning, in order to bring horne the ashes, and oblige the <hi
                        rend="italic">manes</hi> to follow; that so his country might not be
                    destitute of the benefit of his tutelage. It λvas thus that cremation seems to
                    have had its origin; and by degrees it became common to all who could afford the
                    expenses of it, and displaced the ancient method of interment. Thus <hi
                        rend="italic">catacombs</hi> became disused among the Romans after they had
                    borrowed the manner of burning from the Greeks, and then none but slaves were
                    laid in the ground.</p>
