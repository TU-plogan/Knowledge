                <p part="N"><label type="entry">CHURCH</label> bas different significations,
                    according to the different subjects to which it is applied.</p>
                <p part="N">It is understood of the collective body of Christians, or of all those
                    on the face of the earth who profess to believe in Christ, and to acknowledge
                    him as the Saviour of mankind. This is what the ancient writers call the
                    Catholic or Universal Church. Sometimes the word Church is considered in a sense
                    still more extensive, and divided into several branches; as the church militant,
                    which is the assembly of the faithful on the earth; and the church triumphant,
                    which is that of the faithful already in glory; to which the Catholics add the
                    church patient, which, according to their doctrines, is that of the faithful in
                    purgatory.</p>
                <p part="N">Church is applied to any particular congregation of Christians who
                    associate together and concur in the participation of all the institutions of
                    Jesus Christ, with their proper pastors and ministers. Thus we read of the
                    church of Antioch, the church of Alexandria, the church of Thessalonica, and the
                    like.</p>
                <p part="N">Church denotes a particular sect of Christians, distinguished by
                    particular doctrines and ceremonies. In thia sense we speak of the Roman
                    Catholic Church, the Greek Church, the Reformed Church, the Church of England,
                    the Church of Scotland, and the like.</p>
                <p part="N">The Latin or Western Church comprehends all the churches of Italy,
                    France, Spain, Africa, the north, and all other countries whither the Romans
                    carried their language. Great Britain, part of the Netherlands, part of Germany,
                    and part of the north, have been separated from this church ever since the time
                    of Henry VIH., and constitute what we call the Reformed Church, and what the
                    Catholics denominate the Western Schism.</p>
                <p part="N">The Greek or Eastern Church comprehends the churches of all the
                    countries anciently subject to the Greek or Eastern empire, and through which
                    their language was carried; that is, all the space extending from Greece to
                    Mesopotamia and Persia, and thence into Egypt. This church has been divided from
                    the Roman Catholic ever since the time of the emperor Phocas.</p>
                <p part="N">The Gallican Church denotes the Church of France under the government
                    and direction of their respective bishops and pastors. This church has always
                    enjoyed certain franchises and immunities, not as grants from popes, but as
                    derived from her origin or foundation, and which she has taken care never to
                    relinquish. These liberties depend upon two maxims; the first of which is, that
                    the pope has no authority or right to command or order any thing, either in
                    general or in particular, in which the temporalities and civil rights of the
                    kingdom are concerned; and the second, that notwithstanding the pope’s supremacy
                    is acknowledged in cases purely'spiritual, yct in France his power is limited
                    and regulated by the decrees and canons of ancient councils received in that
                    realm.</p>
                <p part="N">The word Church is used to signify the body of ecclesiastics, or the
                    clergy, in contradistinction to the laity.</p>
                <p part="N">Church is used for the place where a particular congregation or society
                    of Christians assemble for the celebration of divine service. In this sense
                    churches are variously denominated, according to their rank, degree, discipline,
                    and the like, as the metropolitan church, the patriarchal church, cathedral
                    church, parochial church, collegiate church, and so on.</p>
                <p part="N">In ecclesiastical writers we meet with Grand Church, which is used to
                    signify the chief church of a place. Thus, in the Greek liturgy, the church <hi
                        rend="italic">of St</hi> Sophia at Constantinople, the see of the patriarch,
                    founded by Constantine, and consecrated under Justinian, is denominated Grand
                    Church.</p>
                <p part="N">The first church publicly built by the Christians is supposed by some to
                    have been that of St Saviour at Rome, founded by Constantine; while others
                    contend that several churches abroad, called by the name of St Peter Vivus, were
                    built in honour of that apostle during his life-time.</p>
                <p part="N">High Church was a denomination originally given to those otherwise
                    called Nonjurors, who refused to acknowledge the title of William III. Prince of
                    Orange, to the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355934?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0706-5934-0687"/>crown of Great Britain, under a notion that
                    James II. though excluded, was still their rightful sovereign. This appellation
                    was given them because they entertained high notions of the dignity and power of
                    the church, and the extent of its prerogatives and jurisdiction. And those, on
                    the contrary, who disapproved of the succession and obstinacy of the nonjurors,
                    were called Low Churchmen, being distinguished by their moderation towards
                    dissenters, and less ardent in extending the limits of church authority. The
                    denomination of High Churchmen is now more generally applied to all who form
                    lofty and ambitious conceptions of the authority and jurisdiction of the church,
                    and who would raise it to an absolute independence of all human power.</p>
