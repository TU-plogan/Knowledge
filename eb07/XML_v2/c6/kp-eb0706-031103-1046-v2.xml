                        Thomas</hi></label>, a statesman, soldier, and poet, descended from a good
                    family in Denbigh, in Wales, was born in London about the year 1515. Having been
                    educated in both universities, but chiefly at Cambridge, he w as introduced at
                    the court of Henry VIII. who sent him abroad in the retinue of Sir Henry Knevet,
                    ambassador to Charles V. and he had the honour to attend that monarch on his
                    ill-fated expedition against Algiers in 1541. Soon after the fleet left that
                    place, he was shipwrecked on the coast of Barbary, in a very dark night; and
                    having exhausted his strength by swimming, he chanced to strike his head
                    -against a cable, which he had the presence of mind to catch hold of with his
                    teeth, and, with the loss of several of them, was drawn up by’ it into the ship
                    to which ∙he belonged. Mr Chaloner returned soon after to England, and was
                    appointed first clerk of the council, which office he held during the rest of
                    that reign. On the accession of Edward VI. he became a favourite of the Duke of
                    Somerset, whom he attended to Scotland, and was knighted by that nobleman after
                    the battle of Musselburgh in 1547. The protector's fall put a stop to Sir Thomas
                    Chaloner’s expectations, and involved him in difficulties. During the reign of
                    Queen Mary, being a determined Protestant, he was in some danger; but having
                    many powerful friends, he had the good fortune to escape. On the accession of
                    Queen Elizabeth he appeared again at court, and was so particularly
                    distinguished by her majesty, that she appointed him ambassador to the Emperor
                    Ferdinand I. being the first ambassador she nominated. His commission was of
                    great importance; and the queen was so well satisfied with his conduct, that
                    soon after his return she sent him in the same capacity to Spain. But Sir Thomas
                    was by no means satisfied with this instance of her majesty’s confidence: the
                    courts of England and Spain being at this time extremely dissatisfied with each
                    other, he foresaw that his situation would be very disagreeable, and soit
                    proved. Elizabeth, however, must be obeyed. He embarked for Spain in 1561, ançl
                    returned to London in 1564, in consequence of a request to his sovereign, in an
                    elegy written in imitation of Ovid. After his return he resided in a house built
                    by himself in Clerkenwell Close, w here he died in the year 1565, and was buried
                    in St Paul’s. Sir William Cecil assisted as chief mourner at his funeral.</p>
                <p part="N">So various were the talents of Sir Thomas Chaloner, that he excelled in
                    every thing to which he applied himself. He made a considerable figure as a
                    poet. His poetical works were published by William Malim, master of St.Paul’s
                    school, in 1579. His principal work was that <pb break="no"

                    restoring the English Republic, in ten books,” which he wrote when he was
                    ambassador in Spain.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Chaloner,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sir Thomas,</hi>
                    the younger, though inconsiderable as an author, deserves to be recorded as a
                    skilful naturalist, in an age when natural history was very little understood in
                    this or any other country; and particularly as the founder of the alum works in
                    Yorkshire, which have since proved exceedingly advantageous to the commerce of
                    this kingdom. Hc was the only son of Sir Thomas Chaloner mentioned in the last
                    article, and was born in the year 1559. Being very young at the time of his
                    father’s death, the lord treasurer Burghley, taking charge of his education,
                    sent him to St Paul’s school, and afterwards to Magdalen College in Oxford,
                    where, like his father, he discovered considerable talents for Latin and English
                    poetry. About the year 1580 he made the tour of Europe, and returned to England
                    before 1584; for in that year we find him a frequent attendant at the court of
                    Queen Elizabeth. About this time he married the daughter of Sir William
                    Fleetwood, recorder of London. In 1591 he was knighted; and, some time
                    afterwards, discovered the alum mines on his estate at Gisborough, near the
                    river Tces, in Yorkshire.</p>
                <p part="N">Towards the latter end of the queen’s reign, Sir Thomas visited
                    Scotland; and returning to England in the retinue of King James I. found such
                    favour in the sight of that monarch, that he was immediately appointed governor
                    to Prince Henry, whom he constantly attended; and when his royal pupil visited
                    Oxford, he was honoured with the degree of master of arts. How he was employed
                    after the death of the prince is not known. Some years before that event he
                    married a second wife, the daughter of Mr William Blount of London, by whom he
                    had some children. He died in the year 1615, and was buried at Chiswick in
                    Middlesex. His eldest son William was created a baronet in the year 1640; but
                    the title became extinct in 1681. He wrote, 1. Dedication to Lord Burghley, of
                    his father’s poetical works, dated 1579; 2∙ The Virtue of Nitre, wherein is
                    declared the sundry cures by the same effected. Lond. 1584, 4to.</p>
