                    well-watered and pleasant valleys, and some fertile plains, surrounded by
                    mountains. The western part of this tract is by no means so mountainous as the
                    northern; and in former times it was a fertile and well-inhabited region, as
                    appears from many magnificent ruins that are scattered over it. From Candahar a
                    tract ofvery considerable extent stretches westward for upwards of two hundred
                    miles. Its general breadth is a hundred miles. This tract is very imperfectly
                    defined, the hills on the north sometimes running into the plain, and the
                    southern parts of the inhabited country not being easily distinguished from the
                    desert on which they border. The aspect of this country approaches to that of a
                    desert. Scarce a tree is to be found in the whole region; the plains are covered
                    merely with low bushes. Through this arid region many various streams diffuse
                    occasional fertility. The banks of the Furrah, the Khaush, and other streams,
                    are well cultivated, and produce wheat, barley, pulse, and abundance of
                    excellent melons. Even at a distance from the streams some patches of
                    cultivation are to be found, which are artificially watered. There are villages
                    among the cultivated lands; but the mass of the inhabitants are scattered over
                    the face of the country in tents. The banks of the Helmund must, however, bé
                    excepted from the general unproductive character of the country, along which a
                    fertile strip extends about two miles in breadth, beyond which the sandy desert
                    begins, and stretches out for many days journey. To the northward of this desert
                    tract is a hilly region, dependent on the Paropamisan range, which includes
                    fertile plains, that are well watered, and produce abundance of wheat, barley,
                    and rice, together with madder and artificial grasses. On these plains grow the
                    tamarisk and the mulberry, and a few willows and poplars; and the orchards
                    contain all the fruit trees of Europe. The country around the city of Candahar
                    is level, of tolerable fertility, irrigated<pb break="no"

                    water courses from the rivers and springs, and most industriously cultivated. It
                    abounds in grain, good vegetables, excellent fruit; in madder, assafoetiđa,
                    lucern, clover, and tobacco, which is in great repute.</p>
                <p part="N">The wild animals of this country are leopards, bears, wolves, hyenas,
                    jackals, foxes, deer, hares, boars, and the wild ass. The tame animals are
                    camels, horses, cattle, mules, asses, sheep, goats, dogs, &amp;c. They have also
                    a few buffaloes. The country produces no metals, nor has it any peculiar
                    manufactures. But as the road between India and Persia passes through it, it has
                    a considerable transit trade. Besides the Dooraunees, one of the chief tribes of
                    the Afghan country, there are in Candahar Hindus, Persians, Belooches, and
                    Taujiks. The Taujiks generally inhabit towns, and follow different trades. The
                    bankers and shop-keepers are all Hindus.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Candahar,</hi> the capital of the above province,
                    and a large and populous city. Its form is that of an oblong square; and as it
                    was built at once on a fixed plan, it has the advantage of great regularity. All
                    the four great streets or bazars in the city meet in a central point, where
                    there is a circular space of about forty or fifty yards in diameter, covered
                    with a dome. This place is called the Chaursoo. It is surrounded with shops, and
                    may be considered as the public market-place, where proclamations are made, and
                    where the bodies of criminals are exposed to the view of the populace. The four
                    streets are each about fifty yards broad. The sides consist of shops of the same
                    size and plan, all one story in height, with the lofty houses of the town
                    overlooking them from behind; and in front runs an uniform veranda, along the
                    whole length of the street. There are gates at the entrance of the streets, with
                    the exception of the northern one, where stands the king’s palace facing the
                    Chaursoo∙ All the other streets run from these four; and though they are narrow,
                    they are all straight, and almost all cross each other at right angles. This
                    city, however, though it is more regular in its plan than most of the cities of
                    Asia, has but a mean appearance, being built for the most part of brick, often
                    with no other cement than mud. It is divided into various quarters, which are
                    attached to the respective tribes and nations which form the inhabitants of the
                    city. Almost all the great nobles of the Dooraunee tribe have houses in
                    Candahar, and some of them are said to be large and elegant. Among the common
                    people the Hindus have the best houses, which they are in the practice of
                    building very high. There are many caravanseraisand mosques; but of the latter,
                    one only near the palace is said to be handsome. The palace is not remarkable;
                    but it contains several courts, many buildings, and a private garden. Near the
                    palace stands the tomb of Ahmed Shah, which is not a large building, but has a
                    handsome cupola, and is elegantly painted, gilt, and otherwise ornamented
                    within. It is held in high veneration, and is a sure asylum, from which the king
                    does not even venture to drag his enemies. It is also common for any of the
                    great lords who are discontented with the world, to retire to this tomb, and to
                    spend the remainder of their lives in prayer. The city is well watered by two
                    large canals from the river Urghundaub, which are crossed in different places by
                    small bridges. From these canals small water-courses run to almost every street
                    in the town, which are in some parts open, and in others are under ground.
                    Candahar is a place of great trade and resort; its streets are crowded from noon
                    till evening; all sorts of trades are carried on in it; and alł articles of
                    manufacture from the west are in much greater plenty and perfection than at
                    Peshawer. The Turcoman merchants from Buckharia and Samarcand frequent the
                    markets of Candahar, whence they transport into their own country a considerable
                    quantity of indigo and other commodities. Candahar so far differs from the other
                    cities in Afghanistan, that the greater part of the inhabitants are Afghans, and
                    of these the greater number of the Dooraunee tribe. But the rude institutions
                    and manners of the Afghans are here superseded by regular government and an
                    efficient police. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Afghanistan.)</hi> The other
                    inhabitants are the same as those in the province, being an assemblage from the
                    different nations of the East. Candahar is surrounded with gardens and orchards,
                    and many places of worship, which are more frequently scenes of pleasure than of
                    devotion. About two miles to the north of the city stands the fortress of
                    Candahar, on the top of a precipitous rock, which, before the introduction of
                    cannon, was considered impregnable. This fortress was in very early times the
                    residence of a Hindu prince. In the beginning of the eleventh century it was in
                    possession of the Afghan tribes, from whom it was taken by Sultan Mahmoud of
                    Ģhizne. It was afterwards captured by the troops of Ghenghis Khan in the
                    beginning of the thirteenth century, and by those of Timour in the fourteenth.
                    In 1507 it was taken by the Emperor Baber, but was soon afterwards recovered by
                    the Afghans. In 1521 Baber again got possession of it, after a long siege.
                    Homayon, the son of Baber, when he was expelled from the throne of Hindustan,
                    agreed to make over the fort and districtof Candahar to the Persian monarch, in
                    return for the aid which he gave him. But repenting of his promise, he again got
                    possession of the fortress, which by its strength defied all the efforts of the
                    Persians to reduce it, and it remained an appendage of Hindustan until the year
                    1625, when it was taken by Shah Abbas the Great, and being surrendered by
                    treachery, was recovered iu 1649, and was successfully defended against
                    Aurungzebe with an army of 50,000 men. Three years after, he was again compelled
                    to retreat from it with disgrace. It remained in possession of Persia till 1709,
                    when it was taken by an Afghan tribe. It was retaken by Nadir Shah, after a
                    siege of two years; and on his assassination, it was taken in 1747 by Ahmed, the
                    chief of the Ab-dallies, who thereby laid the foundation of the Afghan power. We
                    have no information as to the population. Elphinstone, to whom we are indebted
                    for the preceding account, says, “I am utterly at a loss to fix the extent of
                    Candahar, or the number of inhabitants which it contains.” The travelling
                    distance from Delhi by Cabul is 1071 miles; from Calcutta, 2047 miles. (Foster’s
