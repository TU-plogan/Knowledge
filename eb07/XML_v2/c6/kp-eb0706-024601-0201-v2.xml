                    an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, contiguous to the coast of Brazil. It is
                    six miles in breadth from east to west, and twenty-four in length from north to
                    south. A channel, in some places scarcely a mile and a half in breadth,
                    separates it from the main land. The soil of this island is extremely fertile,
                    and produces in abundance rice, maize, mandioca, coffee of excellent quality,
                    oranges equal to any in the world, and a variety of other fruits. Small
                    quantities of sugar and indigo are also raised. The climate is genial, and
                    accordingly a profusion of the finest flowers, amongst which are myrtles and a
                    beautiful specimen of the passion flower, variegate the ground. All the land
                    capable of improvement is in a high state of cultivation. From the demand for
                    timber for ship-building, the extensive tracts of wooded land have been cleared;
                    and that article, at least of a good quality, has now beeome scarce. There is
                    much low swampy land, which is favourable for the production of rice. Flax, of
                    which the fishermen make their lines, nets, and cordage, is also raised. The
                    surrounding seas abound in excellent fish, which arc accordingly very cheap on
                    the island, as are most other articles of food. The climate is healthy, the
                    solstitial heats being moderated by breezes from the south-west and north-east,
                    which generally prevail here. The island is divided into four parishes, and
                    contains above 30,000 inhabitants. It is defended by several fortresses, the
                    most considerable of which is Santa Cruz. Long. 47. 15. W. Lat. 27. 10. S.</p>

                    capital of the foregoing island, and situated on its eastern shore. It has a
                    harbour which is guarded by the fort of Santa Cruz, and may be entered by ships
                    of three hundred tons burden. The town consists of several streets. The houses
                    are well built, and generally of two or three stories in height. It is an
                    agreeable retirement for merchants who have secured an independence, and wish to
                    enjoy it undisturbed. The trade of this place is inconsiderable, as the produce
                    does not mueh exceed the demand of the inhabitants. The latter are estimated at
                    about 6000.</p>
