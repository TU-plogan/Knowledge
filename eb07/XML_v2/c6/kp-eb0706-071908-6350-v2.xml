                    the useful minerals, which have long been wrought upon a very extensive
                    scale.</p>
                <p part="N">Between the Ochil Hills, which form the northern boundary of this
                    district, <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> and the rich alluvial tracts on the banks
                    of the Forth, which winds along in a very irregular line on its opposite
                    extremity, there is a considerable variety of surface. An elevated ridge rises
                    on the west, and, running through the middle of the county, spreads itself
                    gradually till it reaches the eastern boundary, skirting the alluvial or carse
                    lands on the south, and the vale of Dovan on the north. And still farther to the
                    north, the OEhil Hills, the highest of which, Beneloch, in the parish of
                    Tillicoultry, rises nearly 2500 feet above the level of the sea, form a very
                    picturesque landscape, having their generally verdant surface broken by bold
                    projecting roeks, and deeply indented ravines, the beds of many a pellucid
                    stream, with coppice and thriving plantations occasionally interspersed. These
                    hills protect the lower grounds from the piercing winds which blow from the
                    north and north-east, and give Clackmannanshire some advantage, in regard to
                    climate, over the adjoining counties.</p>
                <p part="N">The only streams worthy of notice which traverse this county are the
                    Dovan and the Black Dovan, or, as they are often called, the North Devon and
                    South Devon. The Dovan rises in the county of Perth, and, descending with
                    impetuosity from the Ochils, where its course is to the east, makes a very sharp
                    turn towards the west, and, proceeding placidly in that direction through the
                    pleasant vale already mentioned, falls into the Forth at the village of Cambus.
                    Exclusive of its windings, the course of this river is more than twenty-six
                    miles, though the distance in a direct line from its source to its embouchure
                    does not exceed six miles. It has long been remarkable for the deep and dark
                    chasms which it has worn in the rocks, and through which it flows in the earlier
                    part of its course, being in some places hardly visible. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Devil's Mill,</hi> so called from the supposed resemblance of the sound of
                    the water to that of machinery; the <hi rend="italic">Rumbling 13 ridge,</hi> a
                    very narrow and unguarded pass across a chasm ninety feet deep; and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Cauldron Lynn,</hi> where the water is perpetually agitated in
                    the immense cauldron-like excavations which it has formed in the rock, have been
                    frequently visited by the lovers of natural scenery. Though this river is liable
                    to be suddenly swelled by rains, and frequently descends in torrents overflowing
                    its banks, it is in general of no great depth, but might be rendered navigable
                    for small vessels at a moderate expense, to the effect of bringing 10,000 aeres
                    of coal within reach of water-carriage.</p>
                <p part="N">The Black Dovan has its source in the county of Fife, flows westward in
                    a direction nearly parallel to the Dovan, and falls into the Forth near
                    Clackmannan. This river is extensively employed in turning mills and coal
                    engines, its whole course being over coal strata. In a dry season it is an
                    inconsiderable stream, the greater part of its waters being then collected into
                    reservoirs for the supply of machinery.</p>
                <p part="N">The Forth is navigable as far as it forms the boundary of this county.
                    Ships of 500 tons burden run up as far as Alloa. Its windings, or <hi
                        rend="italic">links</hi> as they are called, are very remarkable. The
                    distance from the quay of Alloa to that of Stirling, measured in the middle of
                    the stream, is seventeen miles, and to the bridge of Stirling it is nineteen and
                    a half, whereas the distance by land from the latter place to Alloa does not
                    exceed seven miles. A little above Alloa there are three islets in the river,
                    the largest containing more than seventy aeres. A remarkable ledgc of roek
                    stretches across the Forth below the two smaller islets, which obstructs the
                    passage of vessels of more than sixty tons burden, and where it is fordable at
                    low water of spring tides. The breadth at this place being only about 500 yards,
                    it was long since proposed to throw a bridge over it, the expense of which was
                    estimated at L.70,000. Mr Rennie, the celebrated engineer, made a survey with a
                    view to a bridge at the Alloa ferry, which he declared to be pracfieable at an
                    expense of L. 150,000; a work which has never been attempted. The passage,
                    however, has of late been improved by means of new piers and a steam boat. The
                    estuary of the Forth, for several miles above and below Clackmannan, exhibits a
                    singular phenomenon in its tides, which rise there from sixteen to twenty-two
                    feet. During neap tides in good weather, and sometimes also during spring tides,
                    if the weather be uncommonly fine, after the water has flowed for three hours,
                    it retires in an hour and a half, nearly as far as the line from which it had
                    begun t□ flow, but returns immediately, and, in an hour and a half more, reaches
                    the same height it had attained before. This flux and reflux takes place both in
                    the flood and ebb tides, so that double the usual number of tides occur in this
                    part of the river. In very boisterous weather, however, these <hi rend="italic"
                        >lecky tides,</hi> as they are called by sailors, are not regular, the water
                    then only rising without any perceptible current, as if two tides were acting
                    against each other.</p>
                <p part="N">The soils of the arable land of Clackmannanshire arc in general
                    productive and well cultivated; though the greater part of the elevated range
                    which is interposed between the earse lands on the Forth, and the vale of Dovan
                    at the base of the OEhils on the north, consists of inferior soils, often
                    incumbent on an impervious elay. All the crops commonly raised in Scotland grow
                    luxuriantly on either side of this tract, which also contains within itself a
                    considerable proportion of valuable soil. From the rental of the abbacy of
                    Cambuskenneth, founded in 1147, it appears, that wheat was cultivated on the <hi
                        rend="italic">links</hi> of the Forth at a very early period; yet it is
                    certain that fifty years ago fields of this grain were only occasionally to be
                    met with in the county. As a proof how early and well the earse lands near Alloa
                    had been cultivated, it may bc mentioned, that more than a century ago some
                    farms in that quarter paid as much grain and 6ther kinds of produce, in name of
                    rent, as the present money-rent of similar soils would purchase at the average
                    prices of the last twenty-five years. The farms would be thought small in other
                    counties; few of the arable ones exceeding 200 Scotch or 250 English acres, and
                    the far greater number being below 100 acres. The rent of the county was
                    returned to the collector of the property-tax for the year ending in April 1811,
                    at L.32,047. 12s., so that, after making allowance for that part of the surface
                    which is covered by water, or otherwise altogether unproductive, every acre must
                    have paid at least 20s. upon an average of all soils and situations. At the same
                    time, the rent of the houses was stated at L.2827. 5s. The old valuation, by
                    which the land-tax and county-rates are apportioned, is L.26,482.10s. 10d.
                    Scots, or L.2206. 17s. 7d. sterling, of which somewhat more than a third belongs
                    to estates held under entail. The richest earse land under current leases now
                    (1832) lets for three bolls a Scotch acre, half wheat and half barley, payable
                    by the fiars, and in the measure of the county. Good carse land commonly rents
                    at three bolls an acre, one of which is wheat, one barley, and one oats. The
                    first effective thrashing machine in Scotland was constructed at Kilbagie, in
                    the parish of Clackmannan, in 1787, by Mr Georgc Meikle, the son of its
                    celebrated inventor; and the last one, it is believed, at which old Meikle
                    himself worked, is on the estate of the Earl of Mar, near Alloa. One of the
                    greatest disadvantages which the agriculture of this district labours under is
                    the want of limestone, of which, however, very large quantities are <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193356376?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-6376-0721"/>
                    brought from Dunbar and other places on the Forth, and afterwards calcined in
                    the county, where coal is always plentiful and cheap. Limeshells are also
                    imported to a considerable extent from the Earl of Elgin’s works in Fife.</p>
                <p part="N">This small county is rich in minerals. Silver, copper, lead, iron-ore
                        <hi rend="italic">(Jiaematites),</hi> cobalt, and arsenic, have all been
                    discovered in the Ochil Mountains, between Λirthry and Dollar; but, after having
                    been wrought for a time with little success, the labour was discontinued. The
                    operations, however, were not conducted upon an extensive scale; in no instance
                    did the miners penetrate below the level of the plain from which the Ochils
                    rise; and it is still believed that these hills abound in valuable metallic
                    veins, ready to reward more skilful and enterprising adventurers. The hazard
                    would be in working for silver, as it is found chiefly in detached nodules.
                    Ironstone is wrought to a considerable extent for the Devon iron-works, in the
                    parish of Clackmannan. It is found either in strata, or in detached oblate
                    balls, imbedded in the schist, and yields from 25 to 30 per cent, of iron. That
                    obtained from the mine now opened at Vicar’s Bridge, near Dollar, affords, it is
                    said, above 40 per cent. The quantity of ironstone extracted in 1830 was 14,500
                    tons.</p>
                <p part="N">The Abbey Craig, near Stirling, a great mass of greenstone rock,
                    crystallized in the internal structure, and rudely columnar in its external
                    appearance, deserves to be particularly noticed, in this view of
                    Clackmannanshire, from its having afforded a very useful substitute, in the
                    manufacture of flour, for the French bur-stones, which it was so difficult to
                    procure during the late war. This discovery was made by a miller of the name of
                    James Brownhill, then employed at the Alloa mills. Several hundreds of these
                    millstones are now working both in England and Scotland, and are found to be in
                    some respects superior to the burs. The Society for the Encouragement of Arts in
                    London presented this ingenious person with a hundred guineas for his discovery,
                    after they had received the most satisfactory proofs of its great
                    importance.</p>
                <p part="N">Coal has been wrought for two hundred years in this county. The quantity
                    at present annually obtained may be estimated at 160,000 tons, of which a great
                    part is shipped for Leith, Dunbar, Tay water, and foreign ports. In the scale of
                    working, the collieries stand thus: 1. Alloa; 2. Sauchy; 3. Clackmannan; 4.
                    Dollar; 5. Tillicoultry; 6. Kennet. It is all either cubical or slate coal, both
                    being often found in the same bed, of an open burning quality; and no smithy or
                    caking coal has yet been discovered. The thinnest seam which has been wrought is
                    twenty-seven inches thick; and in a depth of 105 fathoms there are nine scams of
                    more than this thickness. The pit opened this year (1832) at Hill End, near
                    Clackmannan, contains a seam six feet eight inches in thickness. The strata
                    which compose the coal-field are varieties of sandstone, argillaceous schistus,
                    fire-clay, and argillaceous ironstone. Limestone is found among the lowest veins
                    of the coal strata. Organic remains of shell-fish and plants abound in them; and
                    of the latter, many are of a kind now found only in the equatorial regions.
                    Carbonic acid gas, termed choke-damp, is the most abundant of the noxious
                    vapours found in the coal mines of this field. Hydrogen gas, or inflammable air,
                    was never known here till lately, and it is still in small quantity. The great
                    coal-field of Scotland, which passes in a diagonal line from the mouths of the
                    Forth and Tay to the Irish Sea, is bounded by the Ochils. No coal has been found
                    to the north of them, excepting at Brora, in the county of Sutherland.</p>
                <p part="N">Machinery for drawing water from the mines was constructed and much
                    improved in this county, before the invention of the steam-engine. The Alloa
                    colliery is drain ed by an overshot water-wheel, 30 feet diameter, which lifts
                    the water from the depth of 300 feet. The Sauchy collieries are drained by
                    powerful steam-engines; that employed by the Devon Company is capable of raising
                    10,000,000 gallons of water in twenty-four hours, from the depth of 280 feet. At
                    the Alloa colliery there is an improved cast-iron railway, of about two and a
                    half miles in length, upon which a horse takes down eight waggons with as many
                    tons of coals. The general price paid for working great coal is from 2s. to 3s.
                    per ton; and the selling price on the hill 6s. 8d., which is said to yield but a
                    very small return to the coal-master.</p>
                <p part="N">At the Alloa colliery the workmen have fora great number of years had a
                    court, composed of five of their own number, appointed annually by the
                    proprietor of the works. By this court all differences amongst themselves are
                    settled. The highest fine exacted is half a guinea, and all the fines are put
                    into a general fund for the support of the poor.</p>
                <p part="N">Under the head of manufactures, the distilleries of this county form by
                    far the most prominent and considerable branch. In this small district there
                    were, twenty years ago, no fewer than six large distilleries. Of these, Kilbagie
                    and Kennetpans paid to government an excise-duty greater than the land-tax of
                    Scotland; the former alone ξ&gt;aying no less at one time than about half a
                    million sterling. <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> reviously to 1788, the quantity
                    of grain annually consumed at Kilbagie exceeded 60,000 bolls (45,000 quarters);
                    while 7000 cattle and 2000 swine were fattened upon the grains and dreg. The
                    saving in the stock of food for man, effected by the stoppage of the
                    distilleries, is therefore much less considerable than has been imagined; an
                    acre of barley used in distillation yielding nearly as much animal food as an
                    acre of middling pasture. It is understood that cattle may be fattened in a
                    complete manner, in the proportion of two, of 50 stones avoirdupois each, for
                    every gallon of a still, when working from grain; affording the means, at the
                    same time, of enriching the soil for future crops, by the abundance and good
                    quality of the manure they produce. The effects which distilleries produce on
                    the morals of the neighbourhood is another question.</p>
                <p part="N">The other manufactures of Clackmannanshire, though numerous, are not
                    conducted upon so very extensive a scale. At the Devon iron-works, already
                    noticed, about sixty tons of pig iron are prepared weekly, only a small part of
                    which is used by the foundery at these works. In the parish of Dollar, on the
                    banks of the Dovan, a bleachfield was established in 1787, of which the water
                    and the machinery are excellent. The cloth bleached here consists chiefly of the
                    fine table linen manufactured at Dunfermline. There is a very complete set of
                    corn-mills at Alloa, and there are mills for various purposes in several parts
                    of the county. In the same town, and in the neighbourhood, there are five
                    breweries, a glass work, a copper work, a rope and sail manufactory, a tannery,
                    a tile and brick work; and this year (1832) a steam-engine manufactory has been
                    commenced.</p>
                <p part="N">The port of Alloa is well situated for commerce, and has a substantial
                    well-built quay, and, a little above the harbour, a dry dock capable of
                    receiving vessels of large burden; the depth of the water at spring-tides being
                    sixteen feet, and the width of the gates thirty-four and a half. There is a
                    custom-house here, which comprehends the ports of Stirling and Kincardine, and
                    Clackmannan Pow, and at which 155 vessels were registered in 1831, carrying
                    19,000 tons, and navigated by 1020 men. There are cleared outwards annually, on
                    an average, from 1100 to 1200 vessels, carrying 55,000 tons, and employing about
                    3300 seamen; and inwards, about 700 vessels, carrying 32,000 tons, and 1800 men.

                    alcs for London, and British spirits. In 1830, 430,000 gallons of spirits were
                    shipped for the English market; and in the same year, the excise duties,
                    customs, and taxes rceeived in Alloa, and paid into the exchequer, amounted to
                    L.244,097. The annual imports consist, for the most part, of grain for the
                    distilleries and breweries, of which a great proportion is barley from the
                    county of Norfolk, and goods from Leith, Glasgow, Greenock, and London. Timber,
                    iron, and other commodities, arc occasionally imported from the Baltic. The
                    establishment of packets betwixt Alloa and Leith is likely to prove of much
                    benefit to this district, from the low rates at which goods are transported. A
                    most convenient and expeditious conveyance for passengers, by means of
                    steam-boats, has been recently introduced, with great success, between Newhaven
                    and Alloa, and other places on the Forth.</p>
                <p part="N">Among the antiquities of this county may be mentioned the ruins of
                    Castle Campbell, originally called Castlc Gloom, in a singularly wild and almost
                    inaccessible situation, within a recess of the mountains, above the village of
                    Dollar. The period of its erection and its early history are unknown. It became
                    the property of the Argyll family in 1465, from whom it derived its present
                    name, and was the ordinary residence of Archibald earl of Argyll at the time of
                    the Reformation. In this stronghold John Knox found a temporary retreat. In 1644
                    it was burned by Montrose, and since that time it has been suffered to remain in
                    ruins. The tower of Alloa, built prior to the year 1300, the residence of the
                    Erskines, earls of Mar, and now belonging to the representative of that noble
                    family, is in good preservation. -The walls are eleven feet in thickness, and
                    the highest turret is eighty-nine feet above the ground. The tower of
                    Clackmannan was long the scat of the chief of the Bruces after the failure of
                    the male line. There is a charter, dated the 9th of December 1359, quoted by
                    Douglas, in which Dgvid II. grants to Sir Robert Bruce, whom he there styles his
                    dearly beloved re-∣ lation, the castle and manor of Clackmannan, with divers
                    other lands within the county. Since the death of Henry Bruce of Clackmannan, in
                    1772, leaving no male representative, it has been made a question whether the
                    Earl of Elgin or Bruce of Kennet be now the chief of that royal race.</p>
                <p part="N">Clackmannanshire sends a member to parliament, conjunctly with the
                    county of Kinross. By the reform bill, there are annexed to Clackmannanshire,
                    for the purposes of election, the parishes of Culross and Tullyallan, formerly
                    comprehended in the county of Perth; Alva, formerly belonging to Stirling; and
                    the Perthshire portion of Logie. This arrangement will increase the population
                    to 21,392 souls. Clackmannanshire thus comprehends eleven parishes, the
                    constituency of which, as determined by the sheriff, is as follows :—</p>
