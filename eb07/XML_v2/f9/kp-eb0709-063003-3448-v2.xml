                <p part="N"><label type="entry">FLUTE</label>, an instrument of music, the simplest
                    of all those of the wind kind. It is played on by blowing it with the mouth; and
                    the tones or notes are changed by stopping and opening the ventiges arranged
                    along its side. There is a very ancient instrument. It was at first called the
                    flute <hi rend="italic">a bec,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">bee,</hi> an old
                    Gaulish word signifying the beak of a bird or fowl, but more especially of a
                    cock; the term <hi rend="italic">flute a bee</hi> therefore signifies the <hi
                        rend="italic">beaked flute,</hi> which appears a very proper appellation in
                    comparison with the traverse or German flute. The word <hi rend="italic"
                        >flute</hi> is derived from <hi rend="italic">fluta,</hi> the Latin for a
                    lamprey or small eel found in the Sicilian Seas, and having seven holes
                    immediately below the gills on each side, the precise number of those in the
                    front of the flute.</p>
                <p part="N">By Mersenne this instrument is called the <hi rend="italic"
                        >fistula</hi><hi rend="italic">dulcis seu</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Anglica;</hi> and, according to him, the lowest note for the treble flute
                    is <hi rend="italic">C fa ut,</hi> and the compass of the instrument fifteen
                    notes. 1here is however a flute known by the name of the <hi rend="italic"

                        >te,</hi> the lowest note of which is r. Indeed ever since the introduction
                    of the flute into concerts, the lowest note of the instrument, of what size
                    soever it may be, has been called F; when in truth its pitch is determinable
                    only by its correspondence in respect of acuteness or gravity with one or other
                    of the chords in the <hi rend="italic">scala</hi><hi rend="italic">maxima</hi>
                    or great system.</p>
                <p part="N">Besides the true concert flute, others of a less size were soon
                    introduced into concerts of violins; in which case the method was to write the
                    flute part in.a key corresponding to its pitch. This practice was introduced in
                    1710 b <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi> one 5 oođcock, a celebrated performer on
                    this instrument, and William Babell, organist of the church of All-Hallows,
                    Bread Street, London. They failed, however, in procuring for the flute a
                    reception into concerts of various instruments; for which reason Thomas
                    Stanesby, a curious maker of flutes and other instruments of the like kind,
                    having about the year 1732 adverted to the scale of Mersenne, in which the
                    lowest note is C, invented what he called the <hi rend="italic">new system,</hi>
                    in which, by making the flute of such a size as to be a fifth above concert
                    pitch, the lowest note became <hi rend="italic">C sol fa ut.</hi> By this
                    contrivance the necessity of transposing the flute part was taken away; for a
                    flute of this size, adjusted to the system above mentioned, became an octave to
                    the violin. To further this invention of ' Stanesby’s, Louis Merci, performer on
                    the flute, published, about the year 1735, six solos for this instrument, three
                    of which are said to be accommodated to Stanesby’s new system; but the German
                    flute had now become a favourite instrument, and Stanesby’s ingenuity failed to
                    produce the effect intended. Indeed one great objection against this instrument,
                    which equally affects all perforated pipes, is, that they are never perfectly in
                    tune, or cannot be made to play all their notes with equal exactness. The utmost
                    that the makers of them can do is to tune them to some one key; and to effect
                    this truly, is a matter of no small difficulty. The English flutes made by the
                    younger Stanesby came the nearest to perfection; but those of Bressan, though
                    excellent in their tone, were all too flat in the upper octave. For these
                    reasons some are induced to think that the utmost degree of proficiency on any
                    of those instruments is not worth the labour of attaining it.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">German</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Flute</hi> is
                    an instrument entirely different from the common flute. It is not, like the
                    latter, put into the mouth to be played; but the end is stopt with a tompion or
                    plug, and the lower lip is applied to a hole about two inches and a half or
                    three inches distant from the end. This instrument is usually about a foot and a
                    half in length; rather larger at the upper end than the lower; and perforated
                    with holes, besides that for the mouth, the lowest of which is stopped and
                    opened by the little finger pressing on a brass or sometimes a silver key, like
                    those in hautboys, bassoons, and other similar instruments. Itssound is
                    exceedingly sweet and agreeable; and it serves as a treble in a concert.</p>
