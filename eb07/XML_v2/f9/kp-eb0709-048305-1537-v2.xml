                            Gabriel</hi></label>, a celebrated anatomist and surgeon of the
                    sixteenth century, was born at Modena in 1523. Although he taught anatomy with
                    great distinction, and enjoyed an immense reputation, the details of his life
                    are not exactly known, and have been variously related by different biographers;
                    some, as Tomma-sini and Ghilini, fixing his birth in 1490, which is a manifest
                    error, refuted by F ’ allopius himself; and others, again, contending that he
                    was the disciple of Vesale, although Martine and Haller attest the contrary. But
                    be this as it may, Fallopius made great progress in medical study, first at
                    Ferrara under Antonio Musa Brassavola, and afterwards at Padua. For a time,
                    indeed, he possessed a canonry in the cathedral of Modena; but he soon renounced
                    this function, which prevented him from indulging his taste for dissection.
                    After having taught anatomy for some months in the university of Ferrara, and
                    during three years in that of Pisa, he was chosen by the senate of Venice, in
                    1551, to fill the chair of anatomy and surgery at Padua. He was, besides,
                    entrusted with the demonstration of medicinal plants, and the inspection of the
                    botanic garden, which he enriched with several vegetables collected during his
                    travels in Italy, France, and Greece. But whilst discharging with equal zeal and
                    distinction the various duties which these functions imposed upon him, his
                    career was suddenly arrested by death, on the 9th of October 1562, before he had
                    attained the fortieth year of his age. Fallopius only published a single work,
                    which is not voluminous, but full of curious facts and useful discoveries; it is
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Observationes</hi><hi rend="italic">Anαtomie(e,</hi>
                    Venice, 1561, in 8vo, also, Padua, 1562, Paris, 1562, Cologne, 1562, Helmstadt,
                    1588; and certainly forms an epoch in the annals of anatomical science. It is
                    the first work, indeed, in which we find the exact osteology and angiology of
                    the foetus; notions perfectly sound in regard to the epiphyses; and a luminous
                    description of the delicate and complicated organ of hearing. The illustrious
                    author clearly makes known the cochlea, the demi-circular canals, and the
                    tortuous canal, which still bears the name of Fallopius. He describes, with a
                    care formerly unknown, the ethmoid and sphenoid bones, the alveolar processes in
                    which the teeth are encased, and the arteries, with the veins and nerves
                    connected with them. He has likewise bequeathed his name to the ligament which
                    runs from the anterior point of the ileon to the symphysis pubis. He points out,
                    sometimes individually, at other times with more of method and detail, the
                    occipital, palatine, laryngian, pharyngian, and pyramidal muscles of the
                    abdomen; also the auricular, ocular, and facial muscles; together with the
                    elevator of the eyebrow, and the sphincter of the bladder. Less profound in the
                    knowledge <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751550?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0709-1550-0484"/>of the vessels, he nevertheless enriched that
                    portion of anthropotomy. Before his time anatomists had the most confused and
                    inaccurate ideas respecting the sinus of the spinal marrow, the carotid,
                    meningean, and ethmoidal arteries, the jugular and vertebral veins, and the
                    origin of the artery of the penis. Nor was neurology less indebted to the
                    researches of Fallopius, who discovered the fourth pair of nerves, enumerated
                    the three branches of the fifth, and completed the description of the eighth.
                    Lastly, he carried the same critical spirit into splanchnology in general, over
                    which he diffused much light, particularly in regard to the different sets of
                    apparatus for secreting the bile, the urine, and the semen; and he also traced
                    an excellent description of the clitoris, of the round ligaments, and of the
                    extremities of the womb. To this enumeration of the anatomical labours of
                    Fallopius it may be added, that he was powerfully seconded in his efforts by the
                    principal men of the state. The protection afforded him by the grand duke of
                    Tuscany was carried a length which may probably strike our readers with horror:
                        <hi rend="italic">Princeps jubet</hi><hi rend="italic">ut nobis dent</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">hominem, quem</hi><hi rend="italic">nostro</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">modo interficimus, et illum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >anatomisamus.</hi> The unfortunate men here alluded to were no doubt
                    criminals; yet it is impossible to avoid being shocked beyond expression by the
                    perusal of these w ords. The lectures of Fallopius were published, after his
                    death, by several of his disciples; but none of the latter seems to have
                    performed this task in a manner either creditable to himself or worthy of the
                    great teacher of anatomy by whom they were delivered.</p>
