                    equally celebrated as a restorer of ancient mathematics, and an original author
                    of modern improvements, was born at Toulouse about 1595. His public life was
                    occupied by the active duties attached to the situation of a counsellor of the
                    parliament of Toulouse, in which he was distinguished both for legal knowledge
                    and for strict integrity of conduct. Besides the sciences, which were the
                    principal objects of his private studies, he was an accomplished scholar, an
                    excellent linguist, and even a respectable poet.</p>
                <p part="N">His <hi rend="italic">Opera</hi><hi rend="italic">Mathematica</hi> were
                    published at Toulouse, in two volumes folio, 1670 and 1679; they are now become
                    very scarce. The first contains the <hi rend="italic">Arithmetic of
                        Diophantus,</hi> illustrated by a commentary, and enlarged by a multitude of
                    additional propositions. In the second we find a <hi rend="italic">Method or the
                        Quadrature of Parabolas</hi> of all kinds, and a <hi rend="italic">Treatise
                        on Maxima and Minima, on Tangents, and on Centres of Gravity</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> containing the same solutions of a variety of problems
                    as were afterwards incorporated into the more extensive method of fluxions, by
                    Newton and Leibnitz; and securing to their author, in common with Cavalleri,
                    Roberval, Descartes, Wallis, Barrow, and Sluse, an ample share of the glory of
                    having immediately prepared the way for the gigantic steps of those illustrious
                    philosophers. The same volume contains also several other treatises on <hi
                        rend="italic">Geometric Loci,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Spherical
                        Tangencies,</hi> and on the <hi rend="italic">Rectification of Curves,</hi>
                    besides a restoration of <hi rend="italic">Apollonius'</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p part="N">It was too much Fermat’s custom to leave lιis most important
                    propositions wholly uudemonstrated; sometimes, perhaps, because he may lιave
                    obtained them rather by induction than by a connected train of reasoning; and,
                    in other cases, for the purpose of proposing them as a trial ot strength to his
                    contemporaries. The deficiency, however, has in many instances been supplied by
                    the elaborate investigations of Euler and Lagrange, who have thought it no
                    degradation to their refined talents to go back a century in search of these
                    elegant intricacies, which appeared to require further illustration. It happened
                    not uncommonly, that the want of a more explicit statement ot the grounds of his
                    discoveries deprived Fermat, in the opinion of his rivals, of the credit justly
                    due to him for accuracy and originality. It was thus that Descartes attempted to
                    correct his method of <hi rend="italic">maxima</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >minima,</hi> and could never be persuaded that Fermat’s first propositions
                    on the subject were unexceptionable. Fermat , was however enabled to pursue his
                    favourite studies with less interruption than Descartes; and the products of his
                    labour were proportionate, as Lacroix remarks, to the opportunities he enjoyed,
                    as well as to the talents he possessed.</p>
                <p part="N">There is a very ingenious proposition of Fermat, wnι deserves to be
                    particularly noticed, on account of the discussion that it not long ago excited
                    among mathematic <pb break="no" facs="nls:193752005?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0709-2005-0519"/>philosophers. He has demonstrated that the
                    true law of the refraction of light may be deduced from the principle, that it
                    describes the path by which it can arrive in the shortest possible time from any
                    one point of its tract or course to another; on the supposition, however, that
                    the velocity of light is inversely proportional to the refractive density of the
                    medium: and the same phenomena of refraction have been shown by Maupertuis to be
                    deducible, upon the opposite supposition with respect to the velocities, from
                    the law of the minimum of action, considering the action as the product of the
                    space described into the velocity. But the law of Fermat is actually a step in
                    the process of nature, according to the conditions of the system to which it
                    belongs in its original form; whilst that of Maupertuis is at most only an
                    interesting commentary on the operation of an accelerating force. It was Newton
                    who showed the necessary connection between the action of such a force and the
                    actual law of refraction; demonstrating that all the phenomena might be derived
                    from the effect of a constant attraction, perpendicular to the surface of the
                    medium: and, except in conjunction with such a force, the law of Maupertuis
                    would even lead to a false result. For if we supposed a medium acting on a ray
                    of light with two variable forces, one perpendicular to the surface, and the
                    other parallel to it, we might easily combine them in such a manner as to obtain
                    a constant velocity within the medium, but the refraction would be very
                    different from that which is observed, though the law of Maupertπis would
                    indicate no difference; so that the law must be here applied with the tacit
                    condition that the refractive force is perpendicular to the surface. In
                    Laplace’s theory of extraordinary refraction, on the contrary, the tacit
                    condition is, that the force must <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be perpendicular to
                    the surface; so that this theory not only requires the gratuitous assumption of
                    a different velocity for every different obliquity, which is made an express
                    postulate, but also the implicit admission of the existence of a force,
                    determinate in direction and in magnitude, by which that velocity is modified,
                    and without which the law of Maupertuis would cease to be applicable. It may
                    indeed be said, that the supposition of a medium exhibiting unequal velocities,
                    and attracting the light perpendicularly, is unnatural, and that the law is the
                    more valuable for not being applicable to it; but a mathematical equation is
                    true even with respect to impossible quantities, and a physical law, however
                    useful it may be, requires physical proof; and it will not be asserted that the
                    law of Maupertuis has been or can be established by physical evidence
                    sufficiently extensive to render it universal.</p>
                <p part="N">Fermat died at Toulouse in the end of 1664, or beginning of 1665, at the
                    age of seventy. He left a son, Samuel de F ermat, who was a man of some
                    learning, and published translations of several Greek authors. <hi
