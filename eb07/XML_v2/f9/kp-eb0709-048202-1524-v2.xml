                <p part="N"><label type="entry">FALKIRK</label>, a town of Scotland, in the county
                    of Stirling. It is beautifully situated on the face of an eminence which
                    overlooks the wide expanse of country called the Carse of Falkirk, and consists
                    of one broad street, with a number of narrow streets and lanes branching off
                    from it, or running parallel to it. The houses are in general lofty and well
                    built; and the High Street is ornamented by a spire and clock of modern
                    erection. Besides the parish church, there are a number of meeting-houses for
                    dissenters. Several fine villas have recently been built towards the north of
                    the town, and form a handsome continuation of it, uniting it with the villages
                    of Graham-stone and Bainsford. Falkirk enjoys considerable trade; but the only
                    manufacture carried on is one of leather. The inland trade constitutes the
                    support of the town, the populous neighbourhood being supplied by it with most
                    of the necessaries of life. The Canon iron-works, which are very extensive, are
                    situated about two miles north of the town, and the numerous individuals there
                    employed make Falkirk their general market. There are also some extensive
                    coal-works, distilleries, malt-works, and flourmills, in the immediate
                    neighbourhood; and brewing is carried on to some extent. Falkirk is thus
                    calculated to be a commercial depot for a population amounting to nearly thirty
                    thousand individuals. The town is chiefly noted for its three great cattle
                    markets or <hi rend="italic">trysts,</hi> held annually <hi rend="superscript">
                        7</hi> in August and the two following months. These markets are considered
                    as amongst the largest in Great Britain, and to them a vast quantity of live
                    stock <hi rend="italic">of</hi> every description is brought. The traffic
                    carried on in Falkirk is assisted by branches of the Bank of Scotland and
                    Commercial Banking Company. It was at one time a burgh of barony-under the earls
                    of Linlithgow; but since the fall of that family, and the abolition of the
                    heritable jurisdictions, it has possessed no form of municipal government. The
                    affairs of the town are administered by a body of stent-masters, chosen by the
                    different trades. A justιce-of-peace court is held on the first Monday of every

                    place of some note in the early part of the eleventh century <hi

                    Malcolm Ceanmore assumed the sovereignty. The new church, which was built upon
                    the site of the old one, in front of the town, is a very plain edifice, with an
                    ancient spire attached to it. In the neighbourhood of this town was fought a
                    celebrated battle between the Scotch and English, during the period when Edward
                    I. of England attempted to usurp the sovereignty of Scotland. The Scotch, under
                    Cuming of Badenoch and the renowned Sir William Wallace, were worsted, and two
                    Scottish chiefs, Sir John Graham and Sir John Stewart, fell in the conflict.
                    Their graves are still pointed out in the churchyard; and over the former a
                    monument was erected with an inscription, which has been from time to time
                    renewed. A second battle was fought here on the 17th of January 1746, between
                    the royalists and the insurgents under Prince Charles Edward Stuart. The
                    population of Falkirk, in 1821, amounted to 4000, and in 1831, including the
                    parish, to 12,743. It is at the distance of twenty-four miles from Edinburgh,
                    and twenty-two from Glasgow.</p>
