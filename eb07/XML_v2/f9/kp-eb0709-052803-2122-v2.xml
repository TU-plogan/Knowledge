                    extent, being finely watered, are in the highest degree fertile, and capable of
                    producing all the luxuries of the eastern and western worlds. The soil oι the
                    interior is a rich black loam, which, although but very slightly cultivated, is
                    remarkably prolific. The mountainous parts also might, by suitable cultivation,
                    be made to produce abundantly those fruits which thrive best in the nil y
                    regions of warm climates; but they are for the most part utterly neglected. The

                    separates Fez from the province of Tcdla; and the Seboo, which waters the
                    interior of the country. Fez is estimated to contain about 89,000 square miles

                    capital of the above kingdom, was built in 786, by a prince of the name of
                    Edris, and having soon risen to be a city of the first magnitude, became the
                    capital of the western Mahommedan states. In the twelfth century it is said to
                    have contained seven hundred temples and nosques, a number of which were erected
                    upon a magnificent scale, and adorned with a profusion of marble pillars. It was
                    at one time held, in the highest veneration; and when the road to Mecca was shut
                    up, in the fourth century of the Hegira, pilgrimages to Fez were performed by
                    the western Moslemins, who considered it as a place nearly equally sacred with
                    that where the Prophet had been born. It was also distinguished for its
                    learning, at a time when the Saracens may be said ‘to have enjoyed a monopoly of
                    all the knowledge which then existed. Its schools of philosophy, physic, and
                    astronomy, were famous throughout the Mahommedan kingdoms of Spain and Africa,
                    and were not only resorted to by the youth of these countries, but likewise by
                    Christians. When the Moors were driven out of Spain, Fez became the resort of
                    numerous refugees, who, being superior in knowledge and civilization to their
                    original countrymen, introduced several of the arts, the practice of which for a
                    time retrieved the decaying fortunes of the city. But it gradually sunk with the
                    declension of arts and wealth in Northern Africa; and when the lringdom of which
                    it was the capital became incorporated with the empire of Morocco, it ceased to
                    possess almost any political importance.</p>
                <p part="N">Fez is situated upon the slope of several hills, which surround it on
                    every side except the north and north-cast. As the town is built on inclined
                    planes, and the ground is unpaved, the streets are very dirty, especially in
                    rainy weather. They are, besides, ső narrow, that two horsemen cannot ride
                    together abreast in them; and the gloom thus produced is deepened by the houses
                    (which are very high) having a projection on the first floor. The light is also
                    intercepted by a sort of galleries or passages which connect the upper parts of
                    the houses, and by the high walls which are raised at certain distances from one
                    side of the street tθ the other, as if to support the buildings. These walls
                    have arched passages, which are shut at night, and all communication between one
                    part of the city and another is by this means cut off. The houses have a mean
                    and ruinous appearance; they are either altogether destitute of windows, or
                    possess but a few which are seldom larger than a common sheet of paper, and
                    being placed very high, are generally covered with blinds. Behind the high walls
                    there are some buildings which in the inside present something <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> θ comfort; but it is the general taste of the
                    country to ave a mansion composed of a court-vard, surrounded with a colonnade,
                    which forms a kind of gallery both above and below. By these galleries the
                    adjoining rooms are reached, and these commonly receive their light only from
                    the door, which, on this account, is necessarily large. The rooms are long and
                    narrow; the ceiling, composed of planks, is lofty, and sometimes ornamented; and
                    the floors are paved with bricks, Dutch tiles, or marble, according to the
                    wealth of the occupant. The roofs are covered with stamped earth, about one foot
                    thick; and this singular casing, on account of its weight, bulges the walls
                    outwards, and rends them into fissures, whilst it does not protect the houses
                    from rain. -</p>
                <p part="N">Fez properly consists of two distinct towns, <hi rend="italic">Fas el
                        Bćilee,</hi> or Old Fez, and <hi rend="italic">Fas el Jedid,</hi> or New
                    Fez. The latter, which was founded in the thirteenth century, stands on an
                    eminence commanding the old city, and is surrounded with gardens, which abound
                    in all sorts of delicious fruits and odoriferous flowers. This portion of Fez is
                    principally inhabited by Jews. At the bottom of the valley, which is formed by
                    the surrounding hills into a sort of funnel, runs the river <hi rend="italic"
                        >Wed el Juhor,</hi> the river of pearls, so called on account of its value.
                    Besides refreshing vegetation as it passes along, and plentifully supplying the
                    city with water, it is made to turn several water-mills. Fez possesses a vast
                    number of mosques, the finest of which is called <hi rend="italic">El
                        Cαrou-bin.</hi> It was built during the flourishing period of the city, and
                    is described by Leo Africanus as being a mile and a half in circumference. It is
                    constructed of bricks, stones, and lime, but the architecture is said to be
                    mean. It possesses, however, a great number of gates and arches, and two
                    handsome fountains in the court. There are two other celebrated mosques, one of
                    which (namely, that dedicated to Edris, the founder of the city), is the most
                    frequented in Fez. The palace of the sultan is composed of a great number of
                    court-yards, which serve as entrances to apartments. These consist, besides
                    those for domestic uses, of rooms in which the business of government is
                    transacted. The palace is situated upon an elevation in New Fez. None of the
                    other buildings are in any respect remarkable. There are a great number of
                    shops, to which the inhabitants of the surrounding country daily resort as to a
                    fair, for the purchase of commodities, as they have neither shops nor
                    working-places amongst themselves. Provision-markets are numerous, and the city
                    contains about two hundred caravanserais or inns. The various trades, and the
                    different articles sold, arc divided into classes in separate streets, so that a
                    whole street is occupied by those pursuing one species of traffic or art. Fez
                    contains a vast number of public baths, some of which are good, and consist of
                    several rooms heated to different degrees of temperature. There is an hospital
                    richly endowed, but it is occupied solely by lunatics. There are also a great
                    number of schools, the most distinguished of which are established at the
                    mosques of Carou-bin and of Muley Edris, in a small house or mosque called <hi
                        rend="italic">Emdarsa</hi> or academy. In these philosophy is taught, but of
                    course very imperfectly.</p>
                <p part="N">The manufac tures of Fez consist of woollen hhaĩks, sashes, and silk
                    handkerchiefs, slippers of good leather, which they tan remarkably well, red
                    felt caps, some coarse linen cloth, fine carpets, a curious kind of earthenware,
                    weapons of several kinds, saddlers’ ware, and copper utensils. There are .a few
                    goldsmiths; but the adorning of the person with gold and silver being considered
                    as a sin, this branch of industry is not much patronized. The arts here find
                    little encouragement, and are indeed far inferior to those of Europe, except in
                    the preparation of leather, and in the fabrication of carpets and of hhaiks,
                    which the manufacturers know how to weave as fine and as transparent as gauze.
                    They are also expert in wax-works, weapons, and harness. The heat during the

                    about fifteen miles; to the eastward by the mountains of Wadan, at the distance
                    of about thirty miles; to the westward by a distant range of hills; and to the
                    northward by the country above described. The town, which is abouta mile in
                    circumference, is walled, and contains, according to Major Denham, considerably
                    more than 3000 persons. The streets are very narrow, and the houses are built of
                    mud mixed with small stones. The water is almost all brackish or bitter. In the
                    immediate neighbourhood there are several hundred thousand date trees, which pay
                    duty to the government. Sockna pays of duty annually about 2000 dollars,
                    exclusively of a tax of one dollar on every 200 date trees. The Tripoli money is
                    the currency of Sockna; and this occasions a considerable loss to the traders,
                    who are obliged to pay their taxes in Spanish dollars, which they purchase at
                    exorbitant prices. The dates grow in a belt of sand, at the distance of two or
                    three miles from the towns; and then-quality is far superior to any produced in
                    the north of Africa, in consequence of which they bring a very high price in
                    Tripoli. In the gardens situated about three miles from Sockna, barley, maize, a
                    small quantity of onions, and a few other garden-stuff’s, are cultivated. But
                    there is little or no other kind of vegetation, so that all the animals are fed
                    on dates. This place is infested with an immense quantity of flies, attracted
                    probably by the dates, which are preserved in storehouses. The men have in
                    general a clean and neat appearance, whilst the women are pretty <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 7</hi> and handsome, but remarkable, it seems, for their
                    love of intrigue. The latitude of Sockna is 29. 5. 36. N.Ten miles east by south
                    from Sockna stands the town of Hoon. It is smaller than the former, but is built
                    and walled in the same manner. Palm groves and gardens approach close to the
                    walls of the town, and completely conceal it. The soil is sand, but it is
                    fertilized aud refreshed by little streams from wells of brackish water. Twelve
                    miles east by north of Hoon stands the town of Wadan. Its external aspect is
                    pleasing, being built upon a conical hill, on the top of which are some enclosed
                    houses called the castle; but internally it is inferior to the two other towns
                    in point of neatness, comfort, and convenience. There is here a well of great
                    depth, cut through the solid rock. The bulk of the inhabitants of Wadan are <hi
                        rend="italic">schereefs,</hi> that is, pretended descendants of the Prophet,
                    and Arabs who act as shepherds. A few miles eastward of the town there is a
                    chain of mountains, which, with the town itself, derives its name from a species
                    of buffalo called <hi rend="italic">wadan</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                        i</hi> which is found here in immense numbers. There is also a great
                    abundance of ostriches amongst these mountains, by hunting which many of the
                    natives obtain a subsistence. At all the three towns, Sockna, Hoon, and Wadan,
                    it is the practice to keep tame ostriches in a stable, and in two years to take
                    three cuttings of the feathers.The whole way to Mourzouk is now an almost
                    uninterrupted succession of stony plains and gloomy wadyş, with no water but
                    that of wells, generally muddy, brackish, or bitter, and placed at widely
                    extended intervals. Sand winds also prevail, and their visitations are at all
                    times harassing, and not urifrequently destructive. Several towns or villages
                    are situated in this long and dreary waste, and they are usually encircled with
                    groves of palm. Sebha, whip stands in latitude 27. 3. 8. N., is a mud-walled
                    town, pae' turesquely situated on a rising ground, and surrounded by a palm
                    grove. Two marches farther on lies Ghroodwa, a small and miserable collection of
                    mud huts. The palms here, which are the property of the sultan, extend fro∏ <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ten to fifteen miles east and west. The leading
                    features of the above remarkable tract of country may be ≡hθ <hi
                        rend="superscript"> rt</hi><hi rend="italic">1</hi> described. The basaltic
                    chain known by the name or θ Soudah, or Jebel Assoud, that is, Black Mountains,
                    com mences near Sockna, and extends from north to south t re the year,
                    particularly winter, the climate is agreeable. With regard to the number of
                    inhabitants, much difference of opinion prevails amongst travellers. Mr Jackson
                    estimates the population of the old and new city at 380,000 souls, which is
                    certainly an exaggeration; whilst other authorities reduce the number as low as
                    60,000 and even 30,000 individuals, which is probably below the mark. The
                    traveller who assumed the fictitious name of Ali Bey was told, whilst he
                    remained there, that Fez contained 100,000 souls, and that before the last
                    plague the inhabitants were double that number. Of this population about 2000
                    are Jews, who live in the most abject state, on account of the sovereign
                    contempt with which they are treated by the Moors. They are almost all either
                    artisans or merchants, and they have several synagogues, and a market-place,
                    which is well provided. According to Ali Bey, the city is situated in long. 4.
                    58. 15. W. lat. 34. 6. 3. N. It is 160 miles south of Gibraltar, and 200
                    north-north-east of Morocco.</p>
