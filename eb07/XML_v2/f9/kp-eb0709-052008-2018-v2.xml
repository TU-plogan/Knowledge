                    was descended from an ancient family in Hertfordshire, and born about the year
                    1510, at a village near St Alban’s. He was educated at Oxford, and thence
                    removed to Lincoln’s Inn, where, having applied with uncommon diligence to the
                    study of the law, he soon became distinguished for his elocution at the bar.
                    Cromwell, earl of Essex, the great minister of Henry VIII. introduced him ⅛o the
                    king, who employed him as his menial servant, and in 1535 gave him a grant of
                    the manor of Flamstead, in his native county. This is supposed to have been a
                    profitable estate; but Mr Ferrars being a gay courtier, and probably an
                    expensive man, about seven years afterwards he was taken on execution by a
                    sheriff’s officer, for a debt of two hundred merks, and lodged in the compter.
                    Being at this time member for Plymouth, the House of Commons immediately
                    interfered, and he soon obtained his liberty. He continued in favour with the
                    king till the end of his reign; and in that of Edward VI. he attended the lord
                    protector Somerset as a commissioner of the army, in his expedition to Scotland
                    in 1548. In the same reign, the young king being then at Greenwich, Mr Ferrars
                    was proclaimed Lord of Misrule, that is, prince of sports and pastimes; which
                    office he discharged during twelve days, in Christmas holidays, to the entire
                    satisfaction of the court. This is all that is known of Mr Ferrars, excepting
                    that he died in 1579, at Flamstead in Hertfordshire, and was buried in the
                    parish church. He was not less celebrated for his valour in the field than for
