                    25'north latitude, and bounded by the River and Frith of Tay on the north, by
                    the German Ocean on the east, by the Frith of Forth on the south, and by parts
                    of Kinross, Perth, and Clackmannan on the west. Its greatest length is about
                    fifty miles, and its greatest breadth about twenty miles; but its medium length
                    from east to west is only about thirty-six miles, and its breadth from north to
                    south about fourteen miles. Its area, therefore, contains about 504 square
                    miles, or 322,560 English acres.</p>
                <p part="N">The most prominent features in Fifeshire, when viewed at a distance from
                    the south, are the two Lomond Hills, in the middle of the county, the westmost
                    of which rises 1721 feet above the level of the sea; Largo Law, farther east,
                    952 feet; and Kelly Law, 810 feet. Besides these, there are numerous other
                    elevations scattered throughout the county; and indeed it is everywhere found to
                    present a pleasant variety of hill and valley, stretching in general from west
                    to east, parallel to the Tay and the Forth. The principal valley is that through
                    which the river Eden flows, and is called the Howe of Fife. It lies to the north
                    of the Lomond range of hills, and divides the county into the northern and
                    southern portions. The valleys of the Leven and the Ore, and the valleys
                    connected with, or as it were opening into, the Howe of Fife, are of much
                    smaller extent and appearance. The hills and country on the north of the Hoιve
                    of Fife seem to be a continuation of the Ochil Hills, and have been considered
                    by geologists as belonging to the old red sandstone formation. The prevailing
                    rocks found there are red and white sandstone, amygdaloid, compact felspar,
                    claystone, clinkstone, greenstone, basalt, traptuff, and wacke. Limestone is
                    also found near Newburgh, and shell marl in abundance at Rossie and Lords
                    Carnie.</p>
                <p part="N">The mineral structure of the Howe of Fife, and of some of the other
                    valleys, has never yet been minutely explored. Sandstone quarries, however, have
                    been opened at different <pb break="no" facs="nls:193752317?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0709-2317-0543"/>places, and here and there are to be seen
                    eminences of ' gravel regularly stratified. The rocks of the southern division
                    of Fifeshire chiefly belong to the eoal formation of geologists, and form a
                    portion of the great eoal field of the Forth. Here glanee eoal, or blind eoal as
                    it is sometimes called, is met with occasionally; and slate coal, piteh eoal,
                    and cannel eoal, are oecasionally found together in the same bed, and sometimes
                    in separate strata in the same pit.</p>
                <p part="N">From a charter dated in Mareh 1291, it would appear that coal has been
                    worked in this eounty for more than five centuries. William de Oberville there
                    grants liberty to the convent of Dunfermline to open a eoal-pit in his lands of
                    Pityncreiff. But it has been alleged that this is not the first instance of a
                    Seottish charter containing a right to work coal; for one dated 1284-85 is said
                    to exist, from which it may be inferred that coal was worked in the lands of
                    Tranent before that period. The prineipal eoal works in the county at present
                    are those in the parishes of Dunfermline, Dysart, Wemyss, and Markineh; but eoal
                    is also worked at present, or has been so formerly, in the parishes of
                    Torryburn, Inverkeithing, Dalgety, Burntisland, Abbotshall, Auchterderran,
                    Seoonie, Largo, and Pittenweem.</p>
                <p part="N">In the southern division of Fifeshire limestone is aιso abundant. The
                    lime works at Charleston, belonging to the Earl of Elgin, are perhaps the
                    greatest in Scotland. Upwards of 100,000 tons are said to be raised annually in
                    his lordship’s quarries; whieh quantity is either shipped or sold in its native
                    state, or after being caleined. The Carron Company also work out extensively the
                    lime on their estate of Newbigging, in the parish of Burntisland, and ship it at
                    the harbour of Starleyburn, on the Forth, for their works at Carron, where it is
                    used for smelting iron. The great iron work on the Devon is also supplied for a
                    similar purpose with limestone from Whinnyhall, in the parish of Burntisland.
                    The limestone in the interior of the county is likewise transported aeross the
                    Howe of Fife, and by the way of Newburgh, to the Carse of Gowrie, and
                    Forfarshire and Perthshire.</p>
                <p part="N">Sandstone abounds in the southern division of the county; and, in many
                    plaees, it is of a fine grain and durable nature. The prineipal quarry in the
                    eounty is at Cullello, in the parish of Aberdour. The stone obtained from it, in
                    consequence of its superior quality, has been used for some of the finest
                    buildings in Edinburgh, as well as carried over land to great distances.
                    Ironstone also abounds in the eoal field, and was once worked extensively at
                    Balgonie, where it was smelted. But it is now chiefly worked at Dysart, and sold
                    to the Carron Company. The other roeks found in this coal field are bituminous
                    shale, slate elay, flinty slate, wacke, traptuff, amygdaloid, greenstone, and
                    basalt. Stones somewhat resembling the preeious garnet are sometimes found
                    imbedded in the traptnff at Ely, and are known by the name of the Ely rubies.
                    Copper and zine are also said to have been met with in different plaees, and
                    lead has been worked in the Lomond Hills. Marl is also often found in the
                    marshes and in the lakes, and sometimes in dry seasons it is carried away for
                    agricultural purposes.</p>
                <p part="N">There are none of the mineral springs in the county so remarkable as to
                    be at present frequented as watering plaees. those which arise in the coal
                    fields are frequently chalybeate. One of the two mineral springs at Dysart
                    yields a chalybeate water of considerable strength. In the Howe °l Fife springs
                    issuing from the sandstone or gravel are said to be frequently saline. But in
                    the portions of the county where the trap-roeks abound, the springs, whatever
                    virtues they are supposed to possess, seldom yield any thing <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 5ut</hi> pure water. From the Inkcraig of Carnoek,
                    adjoining tθ a dam dike, there is said to issue a spring of petroleum, <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ro</hi> 5J which there constantly drops a liquid
                    resembling ink.</p>
                <p part="N">the only streams of any note in the county are the Leven and the Eden.
                    The former, which issues fromLoeh Leven, in Kinross-shire, flows eastward,
                    through a beautiful strath, by Leslie, Balgonie, and Balfour, and, after a
                    course of about twelve miles, during which it receives the Lothrie and the Orr,
                    falls into the Frith of Forth at the town of Leven. From the declivity of its
                    channel, it is well fitted for impelling machinery; and accordingly a great many
                    mills and other works have been erected on its banks. An act of parliament was
                    lately obtained, the ehief object of whieh was the erection of works and the
                    construction of mechanism, to regulate the rise or fall of the water in the
                    lake, and to restrain or increase the flow of the river for the benefit of the
                    bleaehfields and other manufactories ereeted upon its banks; and these objects
                    have been accomplished at a sum considerably exceeding L.30,000. The Leven
                    abounds in salmon and sea trout, and where it falls into the sea there is a
                    salmon fishery. The Eden is formed by the confluence of several small streams in
                    the parish of Strathmiglo on the west, near the boundary of Fife with
                    Kinross-shire, and winding slowly through the level valley, and sometimes
                    overflowing its banks, passes the town of Cupar, and loses itself in the German
                    Ocean about eighteen miles from its souree. It contains trout, pike, and eels,
                    and has also a salmon fishery where it discharges itself into the sea. The Guard
                    Bridge over this river, consisting of six arehes, was built in the beginning of
                    the fifteenth century.</p>
                <p part="N">There are a number of lakes in the eounty, none of them very large, but
                    some of them very beautiful, such as those at Lindores,Kilconquhar, Kinghorn,
                    Loehgellie, Camilla, Lochfittie, and Otterston. Most of these lakes abound in
                    pike, perch, and eels, and are frequented by ducks, coots, and other water fowl.
                    The county onee contained many more lakes, whieh have been drained at great
                    expense. Amongst these, the most considerable are the lakes of Rossie and
                    Lochore. Their beds are now used in raising valuable erops.</p>
                <p part="N">From the extensive drainage of the lakes, and the general improvement of
                    the eounty, its elimate within the last forty years has been considerably
                    ameliorated, and is more free than formerly from the injurious fogs whieh used
                    to arise from the lochs and damp lands. At present the elimate may be described
                    as mild. The harvests are early, and snow seldom lies long. As the direction of
                    the hills in the eounty is from east to west, it is mueh exposed to the easterly
                    winds, whieh often eheck vegetation in the spring months; and hoar frosts are
                    not unfrequent so late as the middle of June. The heaviest rains are from the
                    south-west, the south-east, and the north-east, and the winds from the two last
                    points bring the heaviest falls of snow. The driest and most steady weather
                    comes from the north-west and east.</p>
                <p part="N">Four fifths of the county at least are considered at present as arable,
                    and the remainder consists of hills, marshes, moors, lands covered with drifted
                    sand and ehiefly bearing bent, extensive plantations, and high roads. Along the
                    banks of the Forth, above the trap-roeks, and the traet of country on the north
                    of the Howe of Fife, the soil is for the most part of excellent quality, being
                    rieh loam, good clay, and gravel mixed with loamy earth. The soil from St
                    Andrews to the western parts of the county, where the strata underneath consist
                    of freestone, eoal, or slate, is in general greatly inferior. The Howe of Fife
                    contains a eonsiderable proportion of moor and moss, besides a tract of loam
                    partly deep and moist, and partly light and dry.</p>
                <p part="N">Within the last forty years extensive woods haye been planted in the
                    eounty. For instance, there is a forest of Seoteh firs in the Howe of Fife,
                    stretching for many miles in length, on the Leven, Crawfurd, and other estates.
                    I o-rests of all kinds of trees have also been planted on the Raith estate, by
                    Mr Ferguson, the proprietor; and a princely ride along the Cullello Hills, of
                    considerable Iengt , <pb break="no" facs="nls:193752330?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0709-2330-0544"/>was formed and adorned with plantation several
                    years ago by Mr Stuart of Dunearn. Indeed there is hardly a proprietor in
                    Fifeshire of the least consequence who has not contributed extensively to the
                    creation of forests and pleasure grounds on his estate. The oldest woods in Fife
                    are round Leslie House, the seat of the Earl of Rothes.</p>
                <p part="N">There are a great number of splendid mansions in the county belonging to
                    the nobility and gentry, and situated upon their estates. There are some of
                    these estates pretty large, and a greater number above L.500 Scotch of valuation
                    than in any other county in Scotland. But of the 638 estates which it contained
                    in 1811, 491 were below that amount. The annual value of the real property, as
                    assessed in April 1815, amounted to L.405,770 sterling.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1811, the number of freeholders entitled to vote for a
                    county member of parliament was only 207. In 1832, the roll of these voters last
                    made up under the old law contained 234 names, and of this number sixty-three
                    were considered as paper voters; that is, two or three were apparent heirs of
                    owners who were on the roll, and the remainder of the sixty-three were merely
                    nominal owners of the estates from which they derived their privilege. The
                    number of voters for the county member at present on the roll, under the act 2
                    and 3 William IV. cap. 65, is 2228.</p>
                <p part="N">The average size of the farms in Fife used to be about 150 acres; few of
                    them were what might be called large, the greater number were small. Of late
                    years, however, the tendency has been to join several together under one tenant.
                    Many of the farmers are now men of capital and enterprise; and under their
                    direction, supported by the liberality of the proprietors, the recent extensive
                    agricultural improvements, which are visible throughout every part of the
                    county, have been undertaken. The most improved implements of husbandry are
                    everywhere in use. Thrashing-mills are to be found on most farms, some of them
                    moved by horses, a few by wind-mills, others by waterwheels, and of late a
                    number by steam-engines, a power which seems to be in progress of superseding
                    all others. The farm-steadings, and the dwellings of the peasantry, have in a
                    great measure been renewed within the last thirty years, and much improved and
                    enlarged; and the greater part of the fields in the county are well enclosed
                    either with stone dikes or hedges.</p>
                <p part="N">All the farm crops common in the south of Scotland are cultivated here
                    upon a large scale, and almost always according to the most approved system.
                    Flax is now seldom raised. The crops commonly cultivated are, different kinds of
                    oats, barley, wheat, rye, beans, peas, and tares; clover and ryegrass, potatoes,
                    and turnips; and mangel worzel has in some places been recently introduced.
                    Farm-yard dung, the cleanings of the streets of the many towns and villages, and
                    the sea-weed cast ashore and cut upon the rocks, are the principal manures. Lime
                    is universally used, and marl in a few places. Bone dust has also been tried
                    within the last few years, and, upon the whole, very successfully.</p>
                <p part="N">Cattle of the Fife breed have long been in high repute both as fattening
                    and dairy stock. The prevailing colour is black; limbs short and body round;
                    horns small, white, and turned up at the points; bone small in proportion to the
                    carcass; and weighing, when fat, and from three to four years old, from forty to
                    sixty stone. The cows, when well fed, yield from ten to fourteen Scotch pints of
                    milk dąily during the best of the grass season, and continue long in milk; yet,
                    except in the neighbourhood of the considerable towns, the dairy is considered
                    as a secondary object. The oxen were formerly much employed in labour, but they
                    are now seldom to be seen at work. Flocks of sheep are not very numerous. The
                    horses are much the same as in all the lowlands of Scotland. A great many pigs
                    have of late years been reared in the county, and many of them are killed and
                    shipped in a fresh state for the London market. Pigeons are very numerous, the
                    pigeon-houses being lately estimated at no less than 300. Rabbits are in some
                    places protected; and hares, pheasants, and partridges are plentiful. There are
                    few grouse or black-cock; and fallow deer have been frequently seen at
                    Lochfittie, Torbain, and other places.</p>
                <p part="N">Grain is sold in stock and sample at various weekly markets in Fife, of
                    which the most considerable are at Anstruther, Auchtermuchty, Kirkaldy, Largo,
                    and Newburgh. There are also weekly markets at Dunfermline, Cupar, and other
                    places, for the same purpose; and every town of any consequence has one or two
                    yearly fairs for the sale of cattle, &amp;c. although it must be admitted that
                    the number of the yearly fairs in Fife has been much diminished.</p>
                <p part="N">The staple manufacture of this county is linen. Dunfermline has long
                    been famous for its extensive and almost exclusive manufacture of damasks and
                    diapers. Of late years, by the introduction of French improvements in the
                    machinery, and the ingenuity of the workmen, the quality of the fabrics has been
                    much improved, and the trade greatly enlarged. Ticks, checks, sail-cloth,
                    dowlas, and other plain linens and sheetings of every, quality, are made in
                    several towns in the county, but the great seat of the manufacture is Kirkaldy.
                    In 1812, no less than 4,500,000 yards of linen cloth were made by the
                    manufacturers, and stamped of the value of L.280,000; and in 1800, about 600,000
                    yards of plain linen were supposed to have been made by private families for
                    their own use, which were not stamped. The number of hands employed in all the
                    branches of this manufacture in 1800 was computed at 23,192; but the number of
                    hands now employed is greatly increased. No part of the work of weaving in this
                    county is at present, however, carried on with the aid of steam power. There was
                    one steam-loom factory lately in Kirkaldy, but it has been converted into a
                    spinning mill.</p>
                <p part="N">Flax has seldom or never been spun by the hand since the introduction of
                    spinning mills. These now amount to forty-five in number, and include in all
                    upwards of 29,000 spindles. Of these, Mr Fergus of Strathore employs at present,
                    in his great work at Prinlaws, 2684 spindles; and erections have been made at
                    the same work for receiving about 3000 more. Messrs C. Arthur and Sons at
                    Kinghorn run upwards of 2000; Nelson and Co. at Kirkland 1800; Mr John
                    Rutherford, Dunfermline, 1376; Henry Balfour and Co. Leven, 1240; Arthur Aitken
                    and Co. Dunfermline, 1066; W. &amp; J. Yule, Ceres, 1048; Mr Swan, Kinghorn,
                    1026; Mr George Moon, Russel Mill, 1012; but the various other mills have less
                    than 1000 spindles each at work. Supposing each spindle to spin half a spyn-dle
                    daily, making suitable allowances for stoppages and holidays, the various mills
                    in Fife will spin 13,000 spyn-đles daily, 78,000 per week, or 3,900,000 per
                    mill-spinner’s year of fifty weeks; producing yarn to the value of L.438,750,
                    and consuming 6500 tons of flax. The persons employed at these mills consist of
                    hecklers, male and female preparers, spinners, reelers, &amp;c.; and allowing
                    one individual for each twelve spindles, there will be employed at the spinning
                    mills in Fife, of all ages and in all the departments, about 2240 people. Messrs
                    Nelson and Company, at the Kirkland works, manufacture a large proportion of
                    their yarns into sail-cloth and other fabrics, and Mr Rutherford, Dunfermline,
                    converts the greater part of his yarns into threads of all colours. Tlιe yarns
                    at the other mills are generally sold as they are spun.</p>

                    is a good harbour and dry dock; as also at Kirkaldy, Anstruther, and Scotscraig.
                    There are, besides, in the county, forty-eight brewers of ale and beer, the
                    greater part of whom also make malt; fifty-six other maltsters, six extensive
                    distilleries, 1140 retailers of ale and spirits, about 200 retailers of foreign

                <p part="N">The shipping of the county is pretty extensive, and the vessels
                    belonging to it are of such burden as to trade to all parts of the world; a
                    number of them being engaged in the whale fisheries, and others in the Baltic,
                    American, and Australian trade. The exports are the manufactures already
                    mentioned, and the produce of the whale fisheries, coal, limestone, lime,
                    potatoes, and grain of all sorts; and the imports from foreign parts are timber,

                <p part="N">The banking business of the county is extensive. It is managed by
                    branches of the Bank of Scotland at Dunfermline, Kirkaldy, and St Andrews; of
                    the Commercial Bank of Scotland at Cupar, Colinsburgh, Dunfermline, and

                <p part="N">Fifeshire contains thirteen royal burghs with parliamentary privileges.
                    St Andrews, Cupar, Anstruther Easter, Pittenweem, Crail, Kilrenny, and
                    Anstruther Wester, with a constituency at present of 635, send one member to
                    parliament; Kirkaldy, Dysart, Burntisland, and Kinghorn, with a constituency of
                    415, send another; and Dunfermline, having a constituency of 500, and
                    Inverkeithing of thirtyeight, join with Stirling, Q,ueensferry, and Culross in
                    electing a member to represent them. The voters in these thirteen Fife burghs
                    have now increased their constituency to 1588, instead of the 304 individuals
                    who formerly composed their corporations.</p>
                <p part="N">The courts in the county for the trial of crime and civil suits consist,
                    1+ of the burgh courts, the magistrates of which have jurisdiction within their
                    respective royalties or burgh territory only; 2&lt;7Zy, of the sheriff courts,
                    for similar purposes, which are held at Dunfermline for the parishes in that
                    presbytery, and at Cupar for the other parts of the county, at each of which
                    towns the cases are tried either by the sheriff in person, or by substitutes, of
                    whom he has for the purpose one constantly resident at Cupar, and another at
                    Dunfermline, he himself being usually resident in Edinburgh; <hi rend="italic"

                <p part="N">The principal jails in the county are at Dunfermline, Kirkaldy, Cupar,
                    and St Andrews. There is also a small jail attached to the town-hall of almost
                    every burgh in the county, but many of these are seldom used for the recep-t <hi

                    Cupar, ⅛kaldy, and Kinghorn, which are the best in the county, having been
                    erected within the last twenty-five years, none of them have airing ground
                    attached to them for the use of ae prisoners, or are well fitted as places of
                    confinement.</p>
                <p part="N">The great turnpike-roads of the county, which are madfe and maintained
                    by the revenue of the toll-bars, and the ∣ye-roads, which are maintained by a
                    tax on householders, on carriages, and on each plough-gate of land, are under
                    the charge of parliamentary trustees, consisting chiefly of the justices of the
                    peace, and commissioners of supply for the county. Each of the four presbyteries
                    forms a district for managing its own roads. The accounts of the turnpike
                    trustees are printed and published annually. The accounts of the bye-road trusts
                    have however not yet been published. The turnpike-roads and many of the
                    bye-roads are in excellent order, great attention being paid to the introduction
                    of the most recent improvements in road-making. Private railways of wood or iron
                    have been used for many years in transporting for several miles the produce of
                    the coal and lime quarries to the harbours where they are shipped. The most
                    extensive of these railroads is that belonging to the Earl of Elgin. It proceeds
                    from near Dunfermline to Charleston harbour, and has been lately opened to the
                    public for the use of rail coaches carrying passengers.</p>
                <p part="N">Fifeshire is divided into sixty-one parishes, belonging to the four
                    presbyteries of St Andrews, Cupar, Kirkaldy, and Dunfermline, which compose the
                    synod of Fife; but there are four parishes besides in the presbytery of
                    Dunfermline, and one in the presbytery of Kirkaldy, which are not situated in
                    this county.</p>

                    increase of eight percent.; in 1821, 114,550, an increase of thirteen per cent.;
                    and in 1831, 128,800, an increase above the preceding census of twelve per
                    cent.</p>
