                    Bishop of Rochester, was born at Beverley, in Yorkshire, in the year 1459, and
                    educated in the ∞llegiate church of that place. In 1484, he removed to Michael
                    House in Cambridge, of which college he was elected master in the year 1495.
                    Having applied himself tθ the study of divinity, he took orders; and becoming
                    emi- <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> ent as a divine, attracted the notice of
                    Margaret, countess of Richmond, mother of Henry VII., who appointed him her
                    chaplain and confessor. In 1501 he took the degree of doctor in divinity, and
                    the same year was elected chancellor of the university. In the year following he
                    was appointed Lady Margaret’s first professor of divinity in Cambridge; and in
                    1504 he was consecrated bishop of Rochester, a see which he would never resign,
                    though he was offered both Ely and Lincoln. It is generally known that the
                    foundation of the two colleges of Christ-Church and bt John s <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 5</hi> Cambridge, was owing to Bishop Fisher’s persuasion
                    and influence with the Countess of Richmond; he not only formed the design, but
                    superintended the execution, and was appointed by the statutes visitor for life
                    after the death of Lady Margaret. On the promulgation of Luther’s doctrine, the
                    bishop was the first to enter the lists against him. Upon this occasion he
                    exerted all his influence, and is generally supposed to have written the book on
                    account of which Henry VIII. obtained the title of <hi rend="italic">Defender of
                        the Faith.</hi> Hitherto he had continued in favour with the king; but in
                    1527, having opposed his divorce, and denied his supremacy, the implacable Harry
                    determined, and finally effected, his destruction. In 1533 the parliament found
                    him guilty of misprision of treason, for concealing certain prophetic speeches
                    of a fanatical impostor, Elizabeth Barton, otherwise called the Holy Maid of
                    Kent, relative to the king’s death, and condemned him, with five others, to
                    suffer loss of goods and imprisonment during his majesty’s pleasure; but he was
                    subsequently released, upon paying a fine of L.300 for the king’s use.</p>
                <p part="N">King Henry having now espoused Anne Boleyn, his obsequious parliament
                    took the oath of allegiance proper for the occasion. But in this oath the Bishop
                    of Rochester steadily refused to join, alleging that his conscience had not been
                    convinced that the king’s first marriage was against the law of God. For this
                    refusal he was attainted by the parliament of 1534, and committed to the Tower,
                    where he experienced cruel treatment, and would probably have died a natural
                    death, had not the pope created him a cardinal. The king, having now determined
                    on his destruction, sent Rich the solicitor-general, under the pretence of
                    consulting the bishop upon a case of conscience, but really with a design to
                    draw him into a conversation concerning the supremacy. The honest old bishop
                    spoke his mind without suspicion or reserve; and an indictment and conviction of
                    high treason were the consequence. He was beheaded at Tower Hill on the 22d of
                    June 1535, in the seventy-seventh year of his age. Thus died this veteran
                    prelate, who, notwithstanding his inflexible enmity to the Reformation, was
                    undoubtedly a learned, pious, and honest man.</p>
