                        John</hi></label>, an eminent English latvyer in the reign of Henry VI. was
                    descended from an ancient family in Devonshire, though both the time and place
                    of his birth are unknown. He is supposed to have been educated at Oxford, and
                    the great learning displayed in his writings does no discredit to such a
                    supposition; but it is nevertheless altogether uncertain at which university he
                    studied, or whether he ever studied at any. When he turned his views to the
                    legal profession he entered himself of Lincoln’s Inn, where he soon
                    distinguished himself by his knowledge of the civil as well as of the common
                    law. In the fourth year of Henry VI. he was appointed one of the governors of
                    Lincoln’s Inn, and three years afterwards the same office was again conferred
                    upon him. In 1441 he was made a king’s seιjeant at law, and the following year
                    chief justice of the King’s Bench. As a judge Fortescue is highly commended for
                    his wisdom, gravity, and uprightness; and he seems to have enjoyed great favour
                    with the king, who is said to have given him some substantial proofs of esteem
                    and regard. He held his office during the remainder of the reign of Henry VI. to
                    whom he steadily adhered; and having faithfully served that unfortunate monarch
                    in all his troubles, he was attainted of treason in the first parliament of
                    Edward VI. which assembled at Westminster in November 1461, having been included
                    in the same act by which Henry VI., Margaret of Anjou his queen, Edward their
                    son, and many persons of the first distinction, were likewise attainted. When
                    Henry subsequently fled into Scotland, he is supposed to have appointed
                    Fortescue, who appears to have accompanied him in his flight, chancellor of
                    England; and although the name of the latter is not found recorded in the patent
                    rolls, because, as Selden remarks, “being with Henry VI. driven into Scotland by
                    the fortune of the wars with the house of York, he was made chancellor of
                    England while he was there,” yet several writers have mentioned him by this
                    style and title; and in his book <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Laudibus Legum</hi><hi rend="italic">Anglia,</hi> he calls himself <hi
                        rend="italic">Cancellarius</hi><hi rend="italic">Anglia,</hi> which seems to
                    settle the question. Early in 1463, Fortescue embarked at Bamburg with Queen
                    Margaret, Prince Edward her son, and many other persons of distinction who
                    followed the fortunes of the house of Lancaster, and landed at Helvoetsluys,
                    from which the party were conducted by Bruges and Lisle to Lorraine. Being thus
                    expatriated, he remained many years on the Continent, moving about from place to
                    place, as the necessities of the royal exiles required, and endeavouring to
                    promote their interest by every means in his power. But his most important
                    labours during this period were of a different and more lasting kind. Having
                    observed that Prince Edward applied himself wholly to military exercises, and
                    seemed to think of nothing but qualifying himself to command in battle,
                    Fortescue, who had observed in him indications of a sound understanding, judged
                    it high time to endeavour to give him other impressions, and particularly to
                    infuse into his mind just notions of the constitution of his country, as well as
                    a due regard for its laws. With this view he drew up his celebrated work <hi
                        rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Laudibus Legum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Anglia,</hi> which, though it failed of its primary intention, owing to the
                    barbarous murder of the young prince, for whose benefit it was composed, will
                    yet remain a lasting monument of the author’s learning and patriotism. When the
                    prospects of the exiles began to brighten a little, the queen and the prince
                    returned to England, accompanied by Fortescue and others, who no doubt hoped
                    that a more auspicious day was about to dawn upon the descendant of
                    time-honoured Lancaster. But destiny still counter-worked the designs of the
                    heroic Margaret. Her attempt to assert the rights of her son totally failed; and
                    the chancellor, forced to reconcile himself as he best could to the victorious
                    Edward IV. wrote an apology for his conduct, which, though Selden had seen it,
                    has never been published. Little further is known respecting the life of this
                    remarkable man, excepting that, amidst all the changes of masters and varieties
                    of fortune, he stedfastly maintained those constitutional principles which he
                    had with equal ability<pb break="no" facs="nls:193755190?mode=fullsize"

                    treatise ' above referred to. He appears to have died at a very advanced age,
                    though the time of his death, like the date of his birth, has not been
                    ascertained.</p>
                <p part="N">Fortescue’s masterly vindication of the laws of England, though received
                    with great favour by the learned of the profession to whom it was communicated,
                    did not appear in print until the reign of Henry VIΠ. when it was published by
                    Whitechurch in 16mo, but without a date. In 1516 it was translated by Mulcaster,
                    and printed by Tot-tel; and again in 1567,1573, and 1575, and also by White in
                    1598, 1599, and 1609. It was likewise printed, with Hengham’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Summa Magna</hi><hi rend="italic">et Parva,</hi> in 1616 and 1660, 12mo;
                    and again with Selden’s notes in 1672, in 12mo. In 1737 it appeared in folio;
                    and, in 1775, an English translation, with the original Latin, and Selden’s
                    notes, besides a variety of remarks relative to the history, antiquities, and
                    laws of England, was published in 8vo. Waterhouse’s <hi rend="italic"

                    though prolix and defective in style, may be consulted with advantage, and will
                    serve to facilitate the labours of more judicious and able inquirers. 2. Another
                    valuable and learned work by the same author, but written in English, was
                    published in the reign of Queen Anne, under the title of The Difference between
                    an absolute and limited Monarchy, as it more particularly regards the English
                    Constitution, and accompanied with some remarks by John Fortescue Aland of the
                    Inner Temple, London, 1714, in 8vo; and a second edition with amendments
                    appeared in 1719, 8vo. In the Cotton Library there is a manuscript of this work,
                    in the title of which it is said to have been addressed to Henry VI.; but many
                    passages show plainly that it was written in favour of Edward IV. 3. Or the
                    author’s other writings, which were pretty numerous, but never printed, we know
                    nothing more than can be collected from the titles, and the commendations
                    bestowed on them by persons who had perused the manuscripts. Those still extant
                    are, 1. <hi rend="italic">Opusculum</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi

                    observation, will, we trust, yet be printed. When lord-chancellor, Fortescue is
                    said to have drawn up the statute of the 28th Henry VI. on the resumption of
                    certain grants of the crown, which, though much relied on by writers on that
                    subject, is not extant in any edition of the statutes. <hi rend="smallcaps"
