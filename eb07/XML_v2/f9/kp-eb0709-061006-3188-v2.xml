                        >Placidus</hi></label>, a learned astronomer, was ' born at Achleuthen, near
                    Linz, in Austria, on the 28th of May 1721. He received the rudiments of his
                    education in the monastery of Kremsmunster, of which his uncle Alexander was
                    abbot; afterwards went to Salzburg, where he studied a regular course of
                    philosophy, but turned his attention particularly to the mathematics. In 1737,
                    he was admitted as a novice into the Benedictine monastery, Kremsmunster, and
                    the next year he took the solemn vowin presence of the abbot. After being two
                    years in this monastery, during which time he devoted every leisure hour to the
                    study of mathematics and philosophy, he returned to Salzburg to finish his
                    studies in theology and jurisprudence, and at the same time acquired a competent
                    knowledge of the oriental and modern languages, besides history and antiquities.
                    In 1745, he obtained the degree of doctor in divinity, after which he received
                    priest’s orders in his own monastery, and was created professor of
                    ecclesiastical law, which office he held during forty years, discharging its
                    duties until within a few days of his death. He was also chosen as dean of the
                    higher schools, and regent of the young nobility, offices which he retained
                    during his life.</p>

                    truly illustrious. His uncle Alexander fitted up an apartment for containing the
                    instruments necessary for the pursuit of mathematical knowledge; and he also
                    erected an observatory, which was begun in 1748, and completed in 1758, under
                    the direction of Anselm Dering of Emsdorf, a celebrated architect. Whilst the
                    observatory was building, Fixlmillner led a life of retirement and severe study,
                    his favourite pursuit during this time being astronomy. When the edifice was
                    finished, Dobler, a mathematician of some note, was appointed first astronomer;
                    but the successors of his uncle the abbot having discovered Fixlmillner’s
                    extensive mathematical knowledge, made him an offer of the astronomical
                    department, and the sole direction of the observatory; and this place he
                    accepted in the year 1762, at the same time retaining his chair as professor of
                    ecclesiastical law. He was not yet master of the learning which practical
                    astronomy requires; but to remedy this defect he perused attentively Lalande’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Exposition du</hi><hi rend="italic">Calcul

                    of the same author, and in 1766 published his <hi rend="italic"

                    reputation. Ten years after this period he gave the world his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Deeeηηiwη Astronomicum,</hi> Steyer, 4to, containing many curious and
                    important particulars respecting the theory and practice ot astronomy. His <hi

                    decease, still further increased his astronomical reputation; and he was,
                    besides, a large contributor to many periodical publications in different
                    countries.</p>
                <p part="N">He made and collected a great number of observations on the planet
                    Mercury, the importance of which was publicly acknowledged by Lalande, as they
                    greatly assisted him in constructing his tables of that planet. Fixlmillner was
                    one of the first astronomers who calculated the orbit of the new planet Uranus
                        <hi rend="italic">{Geoτgium Sidus)</hi>, his tables respecting which will be
                    found in the Berlin Almanac for 1789. He also proved the truth of what had
                    formerly <pb break="no" facs="nls:193753201?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0709-3201-0611"/>been conjectured, that the thirty-fourth star
                    of Taurus, which Flamsteed observed in 1690, was the new planet. It may be said
                    of most philosophers, that they observe a great deal and calculate little; but
                    the conduct of Fixlmillner was exactly the reverse. He turned his attention more
                    than any of his predecessors to the solar spots, which he observed in the years
                    1767, 1776, 1777, 1778, and 1782, and from which he deduced important inferences
                    respecting the revolution of the sun on his axis.</p>
                <p part="N">Fixlmillner had a genius singularly adapted for the study of mechanics,
                    by which he was enabled to invent a new micrometer, and a machine for grinding
                    concentric circles. As he resided in the country, he was in a great measure
                    deprived of literary assistance; but his indefatigable zeal, diligence, and
                    perseverance more than supplied the want of such aid. He was but little subject
                    to the influence of the stronger passions. Like the laws of nature, which it was
                    his chief delight to study, he was simple, uniform, and constant; and by the
                    mildness and integrity of his character, he acquired the love and esteem of
                    mankind. His high reputation never inspired him with’vanity, and he rather
                    wished to conceal than to propagate what had been written in his praise. His
                    health having been very much impaired by his intense application, he terminated
                    his earthly career on the 27th August 1791, in the seventy-first year of his
                    age.</p>
