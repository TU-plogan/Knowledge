                <p part="N"><label type="entry">INCOMMENSURABLE</label>, in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Geometry,</hi> is a term applied to homogeneous magnitudes which have no
                    common measure, or whereof one cannot be denoted as either multiple, aliquot
                    part, or aliquot parts, of the other, or whose ratio cannot be represented by
                    numbers.</p>
                <p part="N">The great Σror&gt;∕ε∕ωnj5 of the ancients has not expressly called
                    attention to this negative relation of magnitudes earlier than in the tenth book
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but he has kept
                    it steadily in view in the preceding parts of the work. Hence he has two
                    distinct treatises of proportion; the one of proportion in <hi rend="italic"
                        >magnitudes,</hi> the other of proportion in <hi rend="italic"
                    >numbers.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">In the second proposition of the tenth book it is shown, that if from
                    the greater of two magnitudes we take the less, or the highest multiple of the
                    less which it contains, then take from the less the remainder, or the highest
                    multiple of the remainder which is contained in it, and so on continually;
                    whenever this process becomes interminable, the magnitudes have no common
                    measure.</p>
                <p part="N">The simplest instance of this interminable process to which we can
                    refer, is in the case of a straight line and the greater segment of the same
                    divided in extreme and mean ratio. For, by proposition 5, book xiii. it appears,
                    that when the greater segment is taken from the whole, the remainder (that is,
                    the less segment) has exactly the same relation to this greater segment which
                    the greater has to the whole, and so on for ever.</p>
                <p part="N">If we begin a similar process with the diagonal and side of a square, at
                    the end of every two operations the two lines with which we have to proceed have
                    the same <hi rend="italic">relative</hi> magnitude as the two with which we
                    began; and thus we should never come to an end. If, therefore, the side of a
                    square be one foot, we cannot possibly express the diagonal in feet or parts of
                    a foot.</p>
                <p part="N">In fact, although, in ultimate practice, every quantity with which the
                    mathematician has to deal is represented by numbers, whole or fractional, the
                    cases where this representation is not metaphysically accurate are far more
                    numerous than where it is perfect.</p>
                <p part="N">Take, for instance, the vulgar logarithms of the natural <hi
                        rend="italic">p</hi> numbers. Let^ be the logarithm of the number N (where
                        <hi rend="italic">p, q,</hi> and the other general characters which we shall
                    use, p denote integer numbers). Then N = 10 <hi rend="superscript"> y</hi>,
                    whence N <hi rend="superscript"> ¢</hi> &gt; = 10 <hi rend="superscript"> p</hi>
                    = 2 <hi rend="superscript"> p</hi> × <hi rend="italic">5</hi><hi rend="italic
                        superscript"> p</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> And, since the <hi
                        rend="italic">q</hi> power of N contains no prime factors but 2 and 5, N
                    itself can contain no other. Let N = <hi rend="italic">2</hi><hi rend="italic

                        rend="superscript"> P</hi>; so that <hi rend="italic">qr</hi> and <hi

                    Thus^ is necessarily integer, consequently not one logarithm of the series can
                    be properly a fraction; and those which are integer succeed only at intervals,
                    of which each is ten times as great as the preceding.</p>
                <p part="N">We have said that the impossibility of reducing the relation of concrete
                    magnitudes to that of numbers, in an infinity of cases, has caused Euclid to
                    form two distinct treatises of proportion. And it is easy to see by what
                    considerations he has passed from the simpler to the more complex, though this
                    last has priority in the order of the <hi rend="italic">Elements.</hi></p>

                    And both commensurable and incommensurable magnitudes might be brought under the
                    following definition: “The first of four magnitudes has the same ratio to the
                    second which the third has to the fourth, when, according as the first is
                    greater than any multiple, part, or parts whatsoever of the second, equal to it,

                    writers of elements have endeavoured to supersede it. That he has been able to
                    accomplish it logically, without even mentioning the existence of
                    incommensurable magnitudes, is the best possible evidence of its perfection.</p>
                <p part="N">His tenth book has often been called a treatise of incommensurables, or
                    of surds. Not that Euclid has any mode of expressing abstract surds; but he
                    treats of linee and areas whose relation could not be signified arithmetically
                    without surds. The extent of his doctrines on this subject, in more than a
                    hundred propositions, only embraces relations expressed by square roots, and
                    their union with integral or fractional numbers, including repeated extractions
                    of square roots, so as to produce biquadratic roots, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic"

                    rectangle is a fourth of the square of the less.” He discusses with equal
                    fulness the propositions contained in the kindred formula √AB = √U(A + √A <hi
