                <p part="N">This monastery was founded about 1123, by Alexander I. In passing the
                    Frith of Forth he was overtaken by a violent storm, which drove him to this
                    island, where he met with the most hospitable reception from a poor hermit, then
                    residing in the chapel of St Columba, and who, for the three days during which
                    the king remained there tempest-bound, entertained him with the milk of his cow
                    and a few shell-fish. His majesty, from the sense of the danger which he had
                    escaped, and in gratitude to the saint to whom he attributed his safety, vowed
                    some token of respect, and accordingly founded here a monastery of Augustines,
                    and dedicated it to St Columba. Allan de Mortimer, lord of Aberdour, who
                    attended Edward III. in his Scotch expedition, bestowed half of those lands on
                    the monks of this island, for the privilege of a family burial-place in their
                    church. The buildings erected in consequence of the piety of Alexander were
                    considerable; and there is still to be seen a large square tower belonging to
                    the church, with the ruins of the church, and of several other buildings. The
                    wealth of this place in the time of Edward HI. proved so strong a temptation to
                    his fleet, then lying in the Forth, as to suppress all the horror of sacrilege
                    and respect to the sanctity of the inhabitants. The English landed, and spared
                    not even the furniture more immediately consecrated to divine worship. But due
                    vengeance overtook them; for, in a storm which instantly followed, many of them
                    perished; and those who escaped, struck with the justice of the judgment, vowed
                    to make ample recompense to the injured saint. The tempest ceased, and they
                    performed the promised atonement.</p>

                    frith, about midway between the port of Leith and Kinghorn on the opposite
                    shore. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Forth.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">This island is said to derive its name from the gallant Keith, who so
                    greatly signalized himself by his valour in 1010, in the battle of Barry, in
                    Angus, against the Danes; after which he received in reward the barony of Keith,
                    in Lothian, and this little island. In 1549 the English fleet, sent by Edward
                    VI. to assist the lords of the congregation against the queen-dowager, landed,
                    and began to fortify this island, the importance of which they became sensible
                    of, after their neglect of securing the port of Leith, so lately in their power.
                    They left here five companies to cover the workmen, under the command of
                    Cotterel; but their operations were soon interrupted by Μ. Desse, general of the
                    French auxiliaries, who took the place, after a gallant defence on the part of
                    the English. The Scotch kept possession of the island for some years; <pb

                    but at last the fortifications were destroyed by act of parliament, to prevent
                    it from being of any use to the former. The French gave it the name of <hi

                    property of fattening horses. A light-house, which has proved highly beneficial
                    to the shipping frequenting the Forth, was erected on the island in 1805.</p>
