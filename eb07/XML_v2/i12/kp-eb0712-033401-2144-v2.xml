                    in Scotland, situated between 56° 40' and 57° 36' north latitude, and between 3°
                    50' and 5° 50' west longitude from Greenwich, is bounded on the north by the
                    shires of Ross and Cromarty; on the east by those of Aberdeen, Banff, Moray, and
                    Nairn, and by the Moray Frith; on the south by the counties of Perth and Argylc;
                    and on the west by the Atlantic Ocean. It is from fifty to seventy-five miles in
                    length; in breadth from thirty to fifty miles; and its area is computed at 3036
                    square miles, of which the space occupied by lakes has been estimated at 132
                    miles, and the land at 29Ó4, or 1,858,560 English acres.</p>
                <p part="N">The exterior outline of this county is exceedingly irregular. On the
                    north-east, where the county town is situated, a narrow tract runs out between
                    Nairnshire and the Moray Frith. Farther to the east, a portion of it is detached
                    and enclosed by the counties of Moray and Banff; Argyleshire penetrates into it
                    from the south-west; and on the west it is indented by Lochs Moidart, Aylort,
                    Nevis, Hourn, and other arms of the sea.</p>
                <p part="N">The surface is still more varied, consisting of ranges of lofty
                    mountains, alternating with deep narrow valleys, the beds of a great many lakes
                    and rivers. The most prominent feature is Glenmore, or the Great Glen, for the
                    most part a mile in breadth, and bounded on either side by precipitous high
                    grounds, which traverses the county from south-west to north-east, dividing it
                    into two nearly equal parts. In this glen, from north to south, are Loch Ness,
                    Loch Oich, and Loch Lochy, which, being united by the Caledonian Canal, form a
                    line of inland navigation between the east and west scas, or from the Moray
                    Frith on the north-east, to Linnhe Loch, an arm of the Atlantic, on the
                    south-west, a distance of about sixty miles, for frigates of thirty-two guns,
                    and vessels of 600 tons. Loch Ness is remarkable for never freezing, a
                    circumstance ascribed to its great depth; and for its waters having been
                    violently agitated during the great earthquake at Lisbon in November 1755. On
                    each side of this valley there is a number of glens and straths, separated by
                    mountainous ridges, with lakes which receive the waters from the high grounds,
                    and discharge them by outlets, partly into the lakes in the central valley, and
                    partly, by a more direct course, into the arms of the Atlantic on the west, or
                    by rivers which flow from this county into the counties on the east, and thence
                    into the German Ocean.</p>
                <p part="N">The western side, or the country between the great valley and the
                    Atlantic, from Argyleshire on the south to Ross-shire on the north, a distance
                    of about seventy miles, is the most wild and mountainous tract of
                    Inverness-shire, and is therefore known by the name of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Rough Pounds</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> yet, before reaching the
                    sea-coast, the general elevation is somewhat diminished. In this tract,
                    beginning at the south, the principal divisions are, Moidart, Arasaig, Morar,
                    Knoidart, and Glenelg, which contain a variety of glens or valleys, among which
                    are, Glengarry, Glen Moriston, Glen Urquhart, and Strathglass. The most
                    considerable lakes in this quarter are, Loch Eil, Loch Shiel, Loch Arkaig, Loch
                    Garry, and Loch Maddy. Lochan Uain, in the parish of Kilmorack, about forty
                    miles west from Beauly, is said to have been known to remain frozen all the year
                    through. On the east side of the valley lies the extensive district of Badenoch;
                    at its southern termination is Lochaber; and at its northern the Aird, the most
                    fertile part of the county. These divisions also include a great many glens,
                    lakes, and rivers, extensive woodlands, and not a little productive land. The
                    principal valleys here are Glenroy, noted for its parallel roads, which, it is
                    now agreed, must have been formed by the gradual subsidence of the waters, and
                    not by the hand of man; Strathspey, Strathcrrick, Strathearn, and Strathnairn.
                    Treig, Ericht partly in Perthshire, Laggan, Insch, and Moy, are the names of the
                    most considerable of the lochs in this quarter; and here the Spey, the Findhorn,
                    and the Nairn, and a number of smaller streams, have their source.</p>
                <p part="N">The general aspect of Inverness-shire may be further conceived, when it
                    is stated that two thirds of the surface are covered with heath; that only a
                    fortieth part is corn land; and that the corn land, woodlands, and green
                    pastures, together, do not exceed eight acres in an hundred. In many large
                    tracts heath prevails to such a degree that, for twelve or fourteen miles,
                    scarcely any verdure is to be seen, except where a solitary rivulet has
                    occasionally overflowed its banks. On the south of Badenoch there is a flat of
                    deep moss, supposed to be the most extensive in Britain, in which a great number
                    of small lakes are interspersed, some of them containing wooded isles, where the
                    deer, from the inaccessible nature of the ground, find shelter from their
                    pursuers. But the far greater part of the county is occupied with mountains. Ben
                    Nevis, 4380 feet high, stands on the south-west, a little to the east of the
                    Caledonian Canal; Meal Fourvounie, on the west of Loch Ness, is more than 3000
                    feet high; and Cairngorm, partly in Banffshire, upwards of 4000. It has been
                    remarked, as a singular circumstance, that several of the hills, which are
                    covered with heath on the sides, are green on the summit, and produce valuable
                    pasturage. The productive land lies chiefly on the sea-coast, and along the
                    banks of the lakes and rivers; much of it in the latter situation is alluvial
                    and fertile. There is also clay in a few places; but the prevailing soil is
                    sand, or a sandy loam, well adapted to the growth of barley, potatoes, turnips,
                    and other green crops.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal rivers of Inverness-shire are, the Spey, which rises from
                    a loch of that name, a little to the east of the Great Valley, and, flowing in a
                    course from southwest to north-east for about ninety-six miles, falls into the
                    sea about eight miles east of Elgin, in Morayshire, carrying with it the waters
                    of 1300 square miles; the Ness, which issues from Loch Ness, and, flowing
                    through the town of Inverness, falls into the Moray Frith, after a <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:192942157?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-2157-0335"
                    />course of six miles; the Lochy issues from Loch Lochy, and has a course of
                    tert miles westward, till it falls into Loch Eil near Fort λVilliam; soon after
                    it leaves its parent lake, it is joined, from the east, by the Spean, which is
                    remarkable for being crossed by a bridge, two of the arches of which are
                    ninety-five feet high; and the Beauly, which has its source in the north-west,
                    and carries the united waters of the Glass and other two rivulets into the frith
                    of the same name. The Findhorn and Nairn on the east, and the Garry and the
                    Morriston on the west, are smaller streams. The Foyers, which flows into Loch
                    Ness from the south, is remarkable for its celebrated falls, one of which,
                    according to Dr Garnet, is seventy feet, and the other, half a mile lower, 212
                    feet. There are cascades not inferior to these in the parish of Kihnorack, on
                    the waters which unite to form the Beauly, and at Loch Leven head in the
                    southern quarter; near which last place there are also some remarkable
                    caverns.</p>
                <p part="N">Granite, limestone, slate, marble, brick-clay, abound in many parts of
                    Inverness-shire. Lead has been discovered in Ben Nevis, and at three other
                    places in that neighbourhood, and also at Glengarry, but none of it is wrought.
                    A vein of plumbago has also been found at Glengarry. A great part of the
                    mountain of Ben Nevis is composed of beautiful porphyry. There is no coal, and
                    for want of it much of the limestone is of little value.</p>
                <p part="N">From the trees found in great numbers, and some of them of a remarkable
                    size, in all the mosses, there is reason to believe that this country was, at an
                    early period, almost covered with wood; and at present there is a greater space
                    covered with natural pines here than in all the rest of Britain. In Strathspey
                    it is said that three - tiers of stocks have been found, directly above one
                    another, in a moss; from which it is inferred that the deepest must have come to
                    maturity, and been destroyed, before the one next above it was formed. In the
                    same district there are about 15,000 acres of natural firs, besides 7000 of
                    planted firs and larches; and the natural woods on Loch Arkaig, in Glengarry,
                    Glenmoriston, Strathglass, Strathfarrer, and at the head of Loch Shiel, are also
                    very extensive. Full-grown trees of ash, lime, beech, oak, plane, and
                    mountain-ash, are found at Castle Grant, Culloden, and Belladrum, in the
                    northern quarter of the county; but in most other places the woods are in the
                    state of coppice. The birch is in great abundance on the sides of Loch Ness,
                    Loch Laggan, about Rothicmurchus, andin the vale of Urquhart. Part of the great
                    Caledonian Forest extends for several miles near the boundary of this county
                    with Perthshire. Considerable tracts have been planted, chiefly with firs and
                    larches, particularly in the north-east, where the county town is situated, in
                    Badenoch, and <hi rend="italic">on</hi> Loch Eil.</p>
                <p part="N">There are several fishing villages on the east coast, yet the
                    sca-fishery is not prosecuted to a great extent. But the arms of the sea, and
                    the numerous lakes and rivers, afford an abundant supply of fish. The herring
                    occasionally visits Loch Eil; salmon yield a considerable rent on the rivers
                    Lochy, Beauly, and Ness, and are found also in the Morrer, in Loch Insch in
                    Badenoch, and at Invermoriston. Char is caught in several of the lochs, and
                    flounders and sprats in the Beauly. The moors and woodlands are plentifully
                    stocked with game, viz. red and roe decr, the Alpine and common hare, black game
                    and ptarmigan, grouse, partridges, &amp;c.; and pheasants have lately been
                    introduced. Foxes and wild cats are still numerous, and, in the lakes and
                    rivers, otters. There are also eagles, hawks, and owls; and a multitude of water
                    fowls, particularly swans, resort to Loch Insch, and the other lakes of
                    Badenoch.</p>
                <p part="N">. The territory of Inverness-shire is divided into estates θf great
                    extent, and, in proportion to the rental of the county, of great value. In 1804
                    more than the half, if we may judge from the old valuation, belonged to seven
                    proprietors, and as much more was held by other six, as made the possessions of
                    these thirteen individuals equal to more than two thirds of the whole; each of
                    them, at a medium, must, therefore, have contained about 100,000 acres. There
                    are thirty-nine estates valued at above L.500, and thirty-five estates below
                    L.500 and above L.100. The greatest landed proprietors are Lord Macdonald, the
                    Earl of Seafield, Mr Fraser of Lovat, Mackintosh of Mackintosh, Macleod of
                    Macleod, Macdoncll of Glengarry, Colonel Cameron of Lochiel, Lord Glenelg, the
                    Earl of Moray, Chisholm of Chisholm, Colonel Macniel of Barra, Lord Dunmore, Mr
                    Grant of Ballindalloch, Mr Stewart of Belladrum, Mr Baillie of Lochaber, Mr
                    Grant of Glenmoriston, &amp;c. The valuation taken in 1601 was L.73,188. 9s.
                    Scots, and in 1811 the real rent of the lands was L.195,843. 15s. sterling, and
                    of the houses, L.9235. 2s. sterling. The valuation taken in 1814 was L.152,078.
                    12s. 2∣d.; but this sum is nothing like the real rent, being made, merely for
                    collecting the property tax. There are several estates of very considerable
                    income, though not of great extent, such as Muirtown, Insches, Culduthell, and
                    others. The old valuation of the whole of Scotland, as fixed about the middle of
                    last century, and which is still the rule by which county assessments are
                    imposed, is to the actual rent of the lands alone in 1811, as L.l Scots is to L.
                    1.263 sterling; whereas in this county, rents have risen in so much greater a
                    proportion than in the rest of Scotland, chiefly perhaps owing to the
                    introduction of sheep-farming, that its valuation is to its actual rent only as
                    L.l Scots is to L.2.675 sterling; and it is worthy of remark, that this rise
                    cannot be ascribed in any considerable degree to the outlay of capital by
                    proprietors, in building or otherwise, as in most other parts of Scotland.</p>
                <p part="N">Of the occupiers of the land, tacksmen, small tenants, and cottars, of
                    the size of the farms, and the rural economy of the county generally, we have
                    little to say in addition to what we have already offered under the Highland
                    counties of Scotland in the preceding part of this work. Small spots of
                    corn-land contiguous to the hamlets, of which the alternate ridges or lands
                    belong to different cultivators, who used to interchange their allotments once a
                    year, and more recently only oncc in three years; a larger space of <hi

                    till it is exhausted, and then left to nature, when another part, which had been
                    treated in the same manner, but which has been somewhat restored in the mean
                    while by the folding of cattle, takes its place; and beyond this outfield,
                    separated from the higher grounds by a <hi rend="italic">head dike,</hi> large
                    tracts of common pasture; these, with their miserable huts, their irregular and
                    always inefficient labour, their indolence, and their poverty, present a
                    striking picture of what must have been the condition of the great body of the
                    people of' Scotland during the feudal ages; but it is not now, as it was then,
                    somewhat relieved by hospitality and protection on the one side, and respect,
                    gratitude, and attachment, on the other.</p>
                <p part="N">This system, indeed, has been gradually approaching to its termination
                    during the last thirty years, and in some parts of Inverness-shire it exists no
                    longer in its original form. The change has been chiefly effected by the
                    introduction of shccp, which has occasioned many complaints, and probably much
                    real suffering for a time to many individuals, but which is likely in the end to
                    be most advantageous to the public at large. With respect to its effect on
                    population, one main topic of declamation, it has not been such as its opponents
                    allege; for the population of Inverness-shire, any more than of the Highlands in
                    general, has not diminished. On the contrary, its increase in this county, from
                    1755 to 1811, has been much greater than in <pb break="no"

                    />eHaddingtonshire and the other merely agricultural districts of Scotland.
                    Within that period, it has increased from 64,656 to 78,336, or upwards of
                    twenty-one per cent., whilst that of all Scotland has not been more than
                    forty-four per cent.; and it is well known that the far greater part of this
                    apparently general increase has been occasioned by the extension of manufactures
                    and commerce, and is chiefly confined to a few districts.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal exports are cattle, sheep, wool, timber, and slates. The
                    corn grown in the county, chiefly bear or big, and oats, and only on the east
                    coast wheat, is all consumed within itself, much of the bear in illicit
                    distillation; as well as all the potatoes, the most important article of food
                    for the greater part of tlτfe year; and the products of the dairy. It imports
                    coals, lime, flour, oatmeal, groceries, and other articles of domestic
                    consumption. The manufactures are, bagging from hemp, thread, kelp to a
                    considerable extent on the west coast, with some tiles and bricks. There are
                    also tan-works, breweries, bleaehfields, and an iron-foundery; and some attempts
                    have been made at different periods to carry on branches of the woollen
                    manufacture.</p>
                <p part="N">From the west sea a few vessels eome up to Fort William, from which the
                    exports are wool, skins, herrings, kelp, and slates. The most considerable
                    village is Maryburgh, or Gordonsburgh, near Fort William. Grantown is a neatly
                    built village on the great road along the Spey, and, under the auspices of Sir
                    James Grant, the proprietor, it has made considerable progress. It contains a
                    townhouse and prison, with a well-endowed school; and a few years ago a factory
                    was begun for carding and spinning wool, and for making blankets and woollen
                    eloths. Fairs are held for the sale of cattle, sheep, and wool, at Fort William,
                    Beauly, Grantown, and Kingussie, and four in the year in Inverness, where there
                    is also a well-supplied market every Tuesday and Friday. Some years back an easy
                    communication was formed throughout the greater part of the county, by means of
                    the roads made under the direction of theParliamentary Commissioners for
                    Highland Roads and Bridges, half the expense of which is borne by the county,
                    and the other half is granted by parliament.</p>
                <p part="N">Amongst the antiquities of Inverness-shire, which we can only notice
                    generally, are the circles of stones ascribed to the Druids, which are found in
                    many parts of the county, particularly at Corrimony in its northern quarter; two
                    artificial mounts in the parish of Petty, supposed to have been places for
                    administering justice; round buildings, called Picts’ Houses, in Glenelg, and
                    other parts; forts, built without mortar, one of which, called Castle Spynie,
                    two miles east from the church of Beauly, encloses a circle of fifty-four yards,
                    and another, in the parish of Laggan, stands on a rock, a hundred yards in
                    perpendicular height; vitrified forts on the hill of Craig Phadric, about two
                    miles from Inverness, Dundhairdghall in Glen Nevis, and Dun Thion near the river
                    Beauly; and a variety of castles, of which Inverloehy Castle a building of great
                    extent and unknown antiquity, on the banks of the Lochy, near Fort William, is,
                    perhaps, the most remarkable. On a hill near Inverness, called the Castle Hill,
                    stood the castle of the Thane of Cawdor where Macbeth is said to have murdered
                    Duncan. It was razed by Malcolm Ceanmore, who removed the town to the northward,
                    where it now stands, granted its first charter, and built a fortress on the site
                    of the old town, which was repaired in 1715, and finally demolished in 1765.
                    Cromwell erected a citadel at the mouth of the river Ness, which was demolished
                    by Charles II.</p>
                <p part="N">There is a chain of forts stretching across the island, along the line
                    of the Caledonian Canal. Fort George is a regular fortress, mounting eighty
                    guns, with barracks for 3000 men; it was begun in 1747, and completed in twenty
                    years, at an expense of about L. 160,000. It is situated eleven miles eastward
                    from Inverness, upon a neck of land on the Moray Frith, opposite to Fortrose in
                    Ross-shire. Fort Augustus, also a regular fortification, though a place of no
                    great strength, with four bastions, and barracks for 400 men, is situated at the
                    west end of Loch Ness, nearly midway between the east and west seas. It was
                    first built in 1730, at some distance from Loch Ness; but having been demolished
                    by the rebels in 1745, it was afterwards rebuilt nearer the lake. Fort William,
                    built in the reign of William HL, is situated on a navigable arm of the sea,
                    called Loch Eil, at the south-western termination of the great valley. These
                    forts are now useless in a military point of view, though kept in a state of
                    good repair, and answering as barracks for a few soldiers. On Culloden Moor, a
                    level heath to the eastward of Inverness, on the 16th April 1746, was fought the
                    battle which put an end to the rebellion of 1745; the greater part of this heath
                    is now covered with plantations.</p>
                <p part="N">Inverness-shire contains twenty-eight entire parishes, and shares
                    several others with the counties of Argyle, Nairn, and Moray. Of these, twenty
                    are on the mainland, and the remainder in its islands. Some of the parishes on
                    the mainland, as well as in the islands, would form a square of twenty miles
                    each. Kilmalie and Kilmoraek are still larger, extending in length about sixty
                    miles, and in breadth almost thirty. Many of the inhabitants are Roman
                    Catholics, particularly in the districts of Moidart, Arasaig, Morar, and
                    Knoidart, on the west side. The county sends one member to parliament, and the
                    town of Inverness, along with Forres, Nairn, and Fortrose, choose one for the
                    burghs. The sheriff holds courts at four places, two of which, Inverness and
                    Fort William, are for the mainland, and two more for the isles in Skye and Long
                    Island. The population of the whole shire in 1811, 1821, and 1831, is given in
                    the annexed table. (See the <hi rend="italic">Statistical Account of
