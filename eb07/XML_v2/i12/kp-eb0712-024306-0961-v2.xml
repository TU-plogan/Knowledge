                <p part="N"><label type="entry">IDOLATRY, or the worship of idols</label>, may be
                    distinguished into two sorts. By the first, men adore the works of God, the sun,
                    the moon, the stars, angels, daemons, men, and animals; by the second, men
                    worship the work of their own hands, as statues, pictures, and the like: but to
                    these may be added a third, that by which men have worshipped the true God under
                    sensible figures and representations. This indeed may have been the case with
                    respect to each of the above kinds of idolatry; thus the Israelites adored God
                    under the figure of a calf.</p>
                <p part="N">The host of heaven were the first objects of idolatrous worship, on
                    account of their beauty, their influence on the productions of the earth, and
                    the regularity of their motions, particularly the sun and moon, which are
                    considered as the most glorious and resplendent images of the Deity. But
                    afterwards, when the sentiments of mankind became more corrupt, they began to
                    form images, and to entertain the opinion, that by virtue of consecration, the
                    gods were called down to inhabit or dwell in these statues. Hence Arnobius takes
                    occasion to rally the pagans for guarding so carefully the statues of their
                    gods, who, if they were really present in their images, might save their
                    worshippers the trouble of securing them from thieves and robbers.</p>
                <p part="N">As to the adoration which the ancient pagans paid to the statues of
                    their gods, it is certain, that the wiser and more sensible heathens considered
                    them only as simple representations or figures designed to recal to their minds
                    the memory of their gods. This was the opinion of Varro and Seneca; and the same
                    sentiment is clearly expressed in Plato, who maintains that images are
                    inanimate, and that all the honour paid to them has respect to the gods whom
                    they represent. But as to the vulgar, they were stupid enough to believe the
                    statues themselves to be gods, and to pay divine worship to stocks and
                    stones.</p>
