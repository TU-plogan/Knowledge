                <p part="N"><label type="entry">ILLUMINATING</label>, a kind of miniature painting,
                    anciently much practised for illustrating and adorning books. Besides the
                    writers of books, there were artists whose profession it was to ornament and
                    paint manuscripts, and who were called illuminators. The writers of books first
                    finished their part, and the illuminators embellished them with ornamented
                    letters and paintings. We frequently find in manuscripts blanks left for the
                    illuminators, which, however, were never filled up. Some of the ancient
                    manuscripts were gilt and burnished in a style superior to those of later times.
                    The colours were excellent, and the skill in preparing them must have been very
                    great.</p>
                <p part="N">The practice of introducing ornaments, drawings, emblematical figures,
                    and even portraits, into manuscripts, is of great antiquity. Varro wrote the
                    lives of seven hundred illustrious Romans, which he enriched with their

                    2). Pomponius Atticus, the friend of Cicero, was the author of a work on the
                    actions of the great men amongst the Romans, which he ornamented with their
                    portraits, as we are informed by Cornelius Nepos in his life of that illustrious
                    Roman. But these works have not been transmitted to posterity. There are,
                    however, many precious documents remaining, which exhibit the advancement and
                    decline of the arts in different ages and countries. These inestimable paintings
                    and illuminations display the manners, customs, habits ecclesiastical, civil,
                    and military, weapons and instruments of war, utensils and architecture, of the
                    ancients; and they are of the greatest use in illustrating many important facts
                    relative to the history of the times in which they were executed. In these
                    treasures of antiquity are preserved a great number of specimens of Grecian and
                    Roman art, which were executed before the arts and sciences fell into neglect
                    and contempt. The manuscripts containing these specimens form a valuable part of
                    the riches preserved in the principal libraries of Europe; the Royal, Cottonian,
                    and Harleian Libraries, as also those in the two universities of England, the
                    Vatican at Rome, the Imperial at Vienna, the Royal at Paris, St Mark’s at
                    Venice, and many others.</p>
                <p part="N">A very ancient manuscript of Genesis, which was in the Cottonian
                    Library, and almost destroyed by a fire in 1731, contained two hundred and fifty
                    curious paintings in watercolours. Twenty-one fragments, which escaped the fire,
                    have been engraved by the Society of Antiquaries of London. Several specimens of
                    curious paintings also appear in Lambecius’s catalogue of the Imperial Library
                    at Vienna, particularly in volume third, where forty-eight drawings of nearly
                    equal antiquity with those in the Cottonian Library are engraven; and several
                    others may be found in various catalogues of the Italian libraries. The drawings
                    in the Vatican Virgil, executed in the fourth century, before the arts were
                    entirely neglected, illustrate the different subjects treated of by the Roman
                    poet. A miniature drawing is prefixed to each of the gospels brought over to
                    England by St Augustin in the sixth century, which is preserved in the library
                    of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In the compartments of those drawings are
                    depicted representations of several transactions in each gospel. The curious
                    drawings and elaborate ornaments in St Cuthbert’s gospels, made by St Ethelwald,
                    and now in the Cottonian Library, exhibit a striking specimen of the state of
                    the arts in England in the seventh century. The same observation may be made
                    respecting the drawings in the ancient copy of the four gospels preserved in the
                    cathedral church <pb break="no" facs="nls:192941052?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0712-1052-0250"/>of Lichfield, and those in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Codex Rushιvorthianus</hi> in the Bodleian Library at Oxford.
                    The life of St Paul the Hermit, now remaining in Corpus Christi College,
                    Cambridge, affords an example of the style of drawing and ornamenting letters in
                    England in the eighth century; and the copy of Prudentius’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Psycomachia</hi> in the Cottonian Library exhibits the style of drawing in
                    Italy in the ninth century. Of the tenth century there are Roman drawings of a
                    singular kind in the Harleian Library, No. 2820; whilst Nos. 5280, 1802, and
                    432, in the same library, contain specimens of ornamented letters, which'are to
                    be found in Irish manuscripts from the twelfth to the fourteenth century.
                    Caedmon’s Poetical Paraphrase of the book of Genesis, written in the eleventh
                    century, which is preserved amongst Junius’s manuscripts in the Bodleian
                    Library, exhibits many specimens of utensils, weapons, instruments of music, and
                    implements of husbandry, used by the Anglo-Saxons. The like may be seen in
                    extracts from the Pentateuch of the same age in the Cottonian Library. The
                    manuscript copy of Terence in the Bodleian Library displays the dresses, masks,
                    &amp;c. worn by comedians in the twelfth century, if not earlier. The very
                    elegant Psalter in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge, exhibits specimens
                    of the art of drawing in England in the same century. The Virgil in the Lambeth
                    Library of the thirteenth century, and written in Italy, shows, both by the
                    drawings and writing, that the Italians produced works much inferior to ours at
                    that period. The copy of the Apocalypse, in the same library, contains a curious
                    example of the manner of painting in the fourteenth century. The beautiful
                    paintings in the history of the latter part of the reign of King Richard II., in
                    the Harleian Library, afford curious specimens of manners and customs, both
                    civil and military, at the close of the fourteenth and in the beginning of the
                    fifteenth century. Many other instances might be produced; but those who desire
                    further information may consult Strutt’s <hi rend="italic">Regal and
                        Ecclesiastical Antiquities,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Horda
                        Angelcynηan,</hi> published in three volumes.</p>
                <p part="N">This art was much practised by the clergy, and even by some in the
                    highest stations in the church, <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> The famous
                    Osmund,” says Bromton, “who was consecrated Bishop of Salisbury, <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 1076, did not disdain to spend some part of his
                    time in writing, binding, and illuminating books.” Mr Strutt, as already
                    noticed, has given the public an opportunity of forming a judgment as to the
                    degree of delicacy and art with which these illuminations were executed, by
                    publishing prints of a prodigious number of them, in his <hi rend="italic">Regal
                        and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of England,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic"
                        >View of the Customs of England.</hi> In the first of these works we are
                    presented with the genuine portraits, in miniature, of all the kings and several
                    of the queens of England, from Edward the Confessor to Henry VII. mostly in
                    their crowns and royal robes, together with the portraits of many other eminent
                    persons of both sexes.</p>
                <p part="N">The illuminators and painters of this period seem to have been in
                    possession of a considerable number of colouring materials, and to have known
                    the arts of preparing and mixing them, so as to form a great variety of colours;
                    for, in the specimens of their miniature-paintings which are still extant, we
                    perceive not only the five primary colours, but also various combinations of
                    these. Though Strutt’s prints do not exhibit the bright and vivid colours of the
                    originals, they give us equally a view, not only of the persons and dresses of
                    onr ancestors, but also of their customs, manners, arts, and employments, their
                    arms, ships, houses, and furniture, and enable us to judge of their skill in
                    drawing. The figures in these paintings are often stiff and formal; but the
                    ornaments are in general fine and delicate, and the colours clear and bright,
                    particularly the gold and azure. In some of these illuminations the passions are
                    strongly represented. Terror, for example, is strongly painted in the faces of
                    the Earl of Warwick’s sailors when they were threatened with a shipwreck, and
                    grief in the countenances of those who were present at the death of that hero.
                    After the introduction of printing, this elegant art of illuminating gradually
                    declined, and at length became quite neglected.</p>
                <p part="N">Before concluding, it may not be improper to observe, that from the
                    fifth till the tenth century, the miniature paintings which we meet with in
                    Greek manuscripts, are generally good, as are also some which we find amongst
                    those of Italy, England, and France. From the tenth till the middle of the
                    fourteenth century they are commonly very bad, and may be considered as so many
                    monuments of the barbarism of those ages; but towards the latter end of the
                    fourteenth, the paintings in manuscripts were much improved; and in the two
                    succeeding centuries many excellent performances were produced, especially after
                    the restoration of the arts, when great attention was paid to the works of the
                    ancients, and the study of antiquity became fashionable.</p>
