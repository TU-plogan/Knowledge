                    for these lands was not definitively stated; but only in general they were to
                    pray for the souls of the donor and his heirs, dead or alive. Hence they did no
                    fealty, which is incident to all other services, because this religious service
                    was of a higher and more exalted nature. This is the tenure by which almost all
                    the ancient monasteries and religious houses held their lands, and by which also
                    the parochial clergy, and many ecclesiastical and eleemosynary foundations, hold
                    them at this day. But the nature of the service was altered at the Reformation,
                    and made conformable to the reformed doctrines of the church of England. It was
                    an old Saxon tenure; and continued under the Norman domination, from the
                    veneration paid to religious institutions. This was also the reason why tenants
                    in frank-almoigne were exempted from all other services except the <hi
                        rend="italic">trinoda</hi><hi rend="italic">necessitas,</hi> of repairing
                    the highways, building castles, and repelling invasions, just as the Druids,
                    amongst the ancient Britons, had <hi rend="italic">omnium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >rerum immunitatem.</hi> And even at present this is a tenure of a very
                    different nature from all others, being not in the least feudal, but merely
                    spiritual; for, if the service be neglected, the law gives no remedy by
                    distress, or otherwise, to the lord of whom the lands are holden, but merely
                    enters complaint to the ordinary or visitor to correct it.</p>

                    daughter or cousin of the donor, to hold in frank-marriage. By such a gift,

                    an inheritance, like the word <hi rend="italic">frank-almoigne,</hi> but
                    likewise limits that inheritance, supplying not only words of descent, but also
                    of procreation. Such donees in frank-marriage are liable to no service but
                    fealty; for a rent reserved therein is void until the fourth degree of
                    consanguinity be past between the issues of the donor and donee.</p>
