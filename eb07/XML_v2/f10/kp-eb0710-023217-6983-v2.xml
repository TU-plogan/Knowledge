                    animal passion, but from an opinion entertained by each of them that the other
                    is adorned with some amiable or respectable qualities.</p>
                <p part="N">The object of the general principle of benevolence is <hi rend="italic"
                        >mankind,</hi> not any particular individual. Gratitude regards the person
                    from whom he who feels its emotions has received a favour, whether that person
                    be a virtuous or a vicious, a respectable or a contemptible character; it
                    prompts the person obliged to make some suitable return to his benefactor, but
                    not to enter into any particular intimacy with him merely on account of the
                    favours which he has received. Many connections are formed and dignified with
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">friendship,</hi> upon no other principle but the
                    sordid hope which one or perhaps each of the parties entertains of accomplishing
                    some selfish purpose through the assistance of the other. The instinctive
                    affection which a parent entertains for his child, as well as that which the
                    child feels for his parent, seems intended by nature to form an union between
                    the persons thus related to each other; but the union between parents and
                    children, when supported by no other principle but instinct, is different from
                    friendship; it extends no further than to cause the parent to provide for his
                    child during his helpless years, and the child to look up to his parent for
                    protection and support. We need not mention that appetite which is the
                    foundation of love, and is the provision which nature has made for the
                    continuation of our species. This appetite alone, and unassisted by some nobler
                    principle, cannot give rise to any connection worthy of an honourable name.</p>
                <p part="N">After excluding these principles, we can refer the origin of friendship
                    only to “an opinion entertained by each of the parties between whom it subsists
                    that the other is adorned with some amiable or respectable qualities.” A
                    connection founded on different principles we cannot honour with the nameof
                    friendship; but that which flows from this pure source must be noble and
                    virtuous. When two persons of virtue and abilities contemplate each the other's
                    character and conduct, they cannot but view them with complacency and esteem.
                    Habits and actions displaying prudence, fortitude, moderation, integrity,
                    benevolence, and piety, naturally command the approbation of the impartial
                    spectator, and even affect him with delight. But as we are disposed to revisit a
                    landscape the beauties of which we have contemplated with rapture, and read with
                    frequent delight a poem in which genius has faithfully delineated some of the
                    most enchanting scenes or the most interesting events in nature; so we also
                    become desirous to enjoy frequent opportunities of contemplating a character
                    distinguished for eminent abilities and virtues. Hence, whenever men of truly
                    respectable characters enjoy opportunities of mutual intercourse, an attachment
                    naturally takes place between them, entirely disinterested, and founded solely
                    on the approbation with which the one cannot avoid regarding the conduct of the
                    other. The esteem which the one is thus induced to entertain for the other will
                    lead them to seek frequent opportunities of enjoying each other's society,
                    mutually to ask and listen to advice, to trust their most secret and important
                    purposes to each other’s confidence, and to be no less concerned each of them
                    for the other’s interest and honour than for his own. This, and this alone, is
                    genuine friendship, founded on virtue, and on that approbation which virtue
                    never fails to command; it is a natural consequence of intercourse between
                    virtuous men.</p>
                <p part="N">But perhaps such a pure and sublime attachment can scarcely be expected
                    to exist among beings of so mixed and imperfect a character as mankind. The wise
                    man of the</p>
                <p part="N">ļr ancient Stoics, or the Christian who fully obeys the pre-: s cepts
                    and follows the steps of his Saviour, might be capa- , b)e of it; but,
                    unfortunately, humanity never reaches such 1 perfection. Even the purest and
                    most disinterested of s those friendships which prevail among men owe their
                    origin to other meaner principles, as well as to that which 3 has been mentioned
                    as the principle of genuine friendship.</p>
                <p part="N">3 There are certain circumstances favourable, and others</p>
                <p part="N">- adverse, to the formation and continuance of friendship, r These,
                    making amends, as it were, for the imperfection of t human virtue and human
                    knowledge, lead men to overlook</p>
                <p part="N">- each other's faults and follies, and to unite in the bonds of
                    friendship; a friendship which, though less solid, less ge-I nerous, and less
                    lasting, than that which we have above described, is yet attended with effects
                    favourable to the . happiness of individuals, and to the interests of society!
                    in general.</p>
                <p part="N">Equality of age is favourable to friendship. Infancy, • manhood, and old
                    age, differ so considerably from each ι other in their views, passions, and
                    pursuits, that the man will seldom be disposed to associate with the boy or the
                    youth, in preference to one who has had equal experience in the world with
                    himself.</p>
                <p part="N">They who cultivate the same trade or profession enjoy opportunities
                    favourable to the formation of friendship. Equality of rank and fortune is also
                    favourable to friendship. Seldom will a man of fortune be able to gain the
                    sincere friendship of any of his dependents. Though he treat them with the most
                    obliging condescension, and load them with favours, yet still either the sense
                    of dependence, or resentment for imaginary injuries, or impatience of the debt
                    of gratitude, or some other similar reason, will be likely to prevent them from
                    regarding him with cordial affection. Similarity of taste and temper will
                    generally be found favourable to friendship. Two individuals of mild, humane
                    dispositions will naturally take delight in each other’s society and
                    conversation. They who are charmed with the bustle of a gay and active life
                    avoid the haunts of the indolent and contemplative, and join hand in hand to
                    climb the heights of ambition, or tread the round of amusement and
                    dissipation.</p>
                <p part="N">As friendship is an attachment which takes place between certain human
                    characters when placed in certain circumstances, there must therefore be laws
                    for supporting the attachment and regulating the intercourse of friendship.
                    Mutual esteem is the basis on which true friendship is established; and the
                    intercourse of friendship ought surely to be conducted in such a manner that
                    this foundation be not injured. Sincerity may be considered as the first law of
                    friendship. Artifice and hypocrisy are inimical to all social intercourse.
                    Between the deceitful and the honest, therefore, friendship can never subsist
                    for any length of time. But though sincerity is to be faithfully observed in the
                    intercourse of friendship, yet the harshness of contradiction must be carefully
                    avoided. Those obliging manners which are so agreeable in an acquaintance or
                    casual companion are still more so in a friend. If they are necessary to
                    recommend the advantages of social intercourse in general to the members of
                    society, they are no less necessary to communicate a charm to the intercourse of
                    friendship. Mild obliging manners are understood as the natural and genuine
                    expression of kindness and affection; boisterous rudeness, petulance, and
                    neglect, are naturally considered as expressive of opposite sentiments. Mutual
                    confidence is the very soul of friendship. If friendship be rightly defined to
                    be a mutual affection founded on mutual esteem, those who are united in the
                    bonds of friendship cannot but repose mutual confidence in each other.</p>
                <p part="N">Many instances are related which show what power it is possible for
                    friendship to acquire over the human heart.</p>

                <p part="N">We need not here repeat the well-known story of Damon and Pythias, whose
                    generous friendship afforded a spectacle which softened even the savage heart of
                    Dionysius. It is known to every school-boy; for the affecting narrative of
                    Valerius Maximus has been studiously detailed and commented on by almost every
                    succeeding story-teller or moralist. Addison, in one of his Spectators, gives a
                    beautiful little relation, which finely illustrates the power of both friendship
                    and love. The reader is referred to the number of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Spectator</hi> in which the narrative occurs.</p>
