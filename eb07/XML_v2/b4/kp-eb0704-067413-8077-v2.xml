                    literally, injurious or evil speaking. By the writers of the middle ages, it is
                    used to denote simply blaming or condemning any person or thing. But among the
                    Greeks, to blaspheme was to use words of evil omen, or portending something ill,
                    which the ancients were careful to avoid; substituting instead of them other
                    words of softer and gentler import, sometimes the very reverse of the proper
                    ones.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Blasphemy</hi> is more peculiarly restricted to
                    evil or reproachful words spoken of the Deity. Hence Augustin says, <hi
                        rend="italic">Jam vulgo blasphernia non accipitur nisi mala verba de Deo
                        dicere.</hi> According to Lindwood, blasphemy is an injury offered to God,
                    by denying that which is due and belongs to him, or by attributing to him what
                    is not agreeable to his nature. According to the Mosaic law, blasphemy was
                    punished with death; and the same punishment was also awarded by the civil law.
                    By the canon law, blasphemy was only visited by a solemn penance; and introduced
                    the commutation of corporal punishment into a pecuniary fine. According to the
                    English laws, blaspheming God, as denying his being or providence, and all
                    contumelious reproaches of Jesus Christ, are offences at common law, and
                    punishable by fine, imprisonment, and the pillory. And, by the statute law, he
                    who denies one of the persons in the Trinity, or asserts that there are more
                    than one God, or denies Christianity to be true, is for the first offence
                    rendered incapable of any office, and for the second adjudged incapable of
                    suing, being executor or guardian, receiving any gift or legacy, and ordered to
                    be imprisoned for three years.</p>
                <p part="N">By the law of Scotland, as it originally stood, the punishment of
                    blasphemy was death. The first species of blasphemy consists in railing at or
                    cursing God; and here the single act constitutes the crime. The second consists
                    in denying the existence of the Supreme Being, or any of the persons of the
                    Trinity, and in obstinately persevering in this denial to the last. For
                    reiterated denial does not fully constitute the crime, because the statute of
                    Charles II. 1661 admits of repentance before conviction as a compįete expiation.
                    And this statute of 1661 is ratified by an act of King Willjam, by which the
                    calling in question the existence of God, or of any of the persons of the
                    Trinity, or the authority of the Scripture, or the Divine Providence, is made
                    penal; the punishment for the first offence being imprisonment till satisfaction
                    be given by public repentance in sackcloth, and for the second a fine of a
                    year’s valued rent of the real estate of the culprit, and the twentieth part of
                    his personal estate; and the trial in both these cases being competent to
                    inferior judges. The punishment of the third offence is death, and hence it can
                    only be tried by the court of justiciary.</p>

                    crime thus deno-nnnated, and the grounds of the extreme guilt ascribed to it. Dr
                    Tillotson maintains that it consists in maliciously attributing to the devil the
                    miraculous operations which Christ performed by the power of the Holy Ghost. But
                    Dr.Whitby refers it to the dispensation of the Holy Ghost, which commenced after
                    our Lord’s resurrection and ascension; and contends that those were guilty of
                    the crime who persisted in their unbelief, and blasphemed the Holy Ghost,
                    representing him as an evil spirit. The crime was unpardonable, because it
                    implied a wilful opposition to the last and most powerful evidence which God had
                    vouchsafed to mankind, and precluded the possibility of a return to faith and
                    repentance.</p>
