                    celebrated chemist, member of the nstιtute of France, was born in 1725, at
                    Chalons-sur-aιne. He showed a great inclination to study, and was sent by his
                    parents to school at Troyes, where he went <hi rend="superscript"> 11</hi> θugh
                    a course of classical education with success.</p>
                <p part="N">1 he bent of his disposition was to physical science. He <hi
                        rend="superscript"> w</hi> ent to Paris in 1749, and became the pupil and
                    friend of an eminent druggist. In this situation he acquired a complete
                    knowledge of the profession; and, before the age of thirty, he was appointed
                    chief apothecary to the French army in Germany, in the Seven Years’ War, a
                    situation which he filled with industry, intelligence, and integrity.</p>
                <p part="N">After the conclusion of peace, he returned to Paris. The French
                    government had employed Rouelle to name chemists for the purpose of analyzing
                    the mineral waters which are found in different parts of France, and had
                    allotted funds for this purpose. One of the chemists named was Bayen, and he
                    employed himself ardently in these analyses for several years. Eĭis analysis of
                    the waters of Barége and of Bagnĕres de Luchon are published; and besides the
                    detail of accurate and well-contrived chemical processes, they contain matter
                    interesting to the medical man, to the naturalist, and even to the general
                    reader. He resided at the above-named baths, in the Pyrenees, whilst he was
                    employed in analyzing the waters. The project of the French government was not
                    carried farther than the analysis of these waters, so that the public employment
                    of Baycn now ceased.</p>
                <p part="N">He returned to Paris, and made the analysis of different minerals which
                    he had collected chiefly during his residence in the Alpine region of the
                    Pyrenees. Amongst these is the marble of Campan, of which there are two
                    varieties, the rcd and the grcen. They are brought from that country to Paris,
                    where they make a distinguished figure in ornamental architecture; as may bc
                    seen in the columns of the palace of Great Trianon, in the interior of the
                    church of St Sulpice, and in other great buildings. These analyses are published
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires présentes a l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic"
                        >Académie par divers Sαvaηs,</hi> commonly called <hi rend="italic">Mémoires

                <p part="N">He made most accurate experiments on the oxides of mercury, to show that
                    oxidation arises from the absorption of a portion of the atmospheric air, and
                    that the existence of the phlogiston of Stahl could not be proved. Lavoisier was
                    present when the account of these experiments was read, and was employed at the
                    same time in examining the metallic oxides; and it was Lavoisier that brought
                    the subject into a clearer light, and demonstrated the nature of oxygen, and the
                    composition of the atmosphere.</p>
                <p part="N">Bayen published an analysis of tin and pewter. In consequence of the
                    writings of some German chemists, fears had arisen amongst the public, that the
                    use of these metals in culinary vessels was pernicious. Bayen showed that these
                    fears were without any ground, if the pewter be of the legal standard, and be
                    not fraudulently mixed with too great a portion of lead.</p>
                <p part="N">His mode of analyzing minerals required a long time; he exposed the
                    mineral, without being reduced to powder, to the action of sulphuric acid at the
                    temperature of the atmosphere; after this action had continued for a length of
                    time, he got by lixiviation the sulphates formed by the combination of the acid,
                    with the different component elements of the stone. He did not make use of the
                    trituration of the stone to an impalpable powder, nor its fusion with caustic
                    potash, which facilitate the subsequent action of acids, and which are used with
                    so much advantage in the processes of modern chemists. The account he has
                    published of his analysis will nevertheless be instructive to the chemical
                    student, although the excellent and expeditious methods of Klaproth and
                    Vauquelin are those that should be followed in practice.</p>
                <p part="N">He enjoyed good health till sixty, and died at the age of seventy-six,
                    in the year 1801. He was a man of sound judgment, of strict integrity, and
                    acquainted with several other branches of knowledge besides that which he
                    particularly cultivated. There is a collection of his works, entitled <hi
