                    near Buckingham, in the year 1608. In 1629 he obtained a license, and for some
                    years practised in and about Oxford; but his practice was chiefly amongst the
                    Puritans, who at that time considered him as one of their party. In 1637 he took
                    his degree of doctor in physic, and became very eminent in his profession; so

                    royal party, and was made principal physician to the king, and fellow of the
                    Royal Society; all which preferment, it is said, was owing to a report raised on
                    purpose by his friends, that he had given the Protector a dose which hastened
                    his death. Dr Bate wrote in Latin an account of the civil commotions in England,
                    and some other pieces. He died at his house in Hatton-Garden, and was buried
                    atKingston-upon-Thames, in Surrey.</p>
                <p part="N">There was another George Bate, who wrote a work entitled, “The Lives,
                    Actions, and Execution, of the prime Actors and principal Contrivers of that
                    horrid Murther of our late pious and sacred King Charles I.”</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Bate Isle,</hi> an island of Hindostan, belonging
                    to the province of Gujerat, situated at the south-western extremity of the Gulf
                    of Cutch. This island has a good harbour, well secured from the prevailing
                    winds, but with a rocky anchorage. The island of Bate is a great resort of
                    Hindoo pilgrims; and the town contains 2000 houses, chiefly inhabited by
                    Brahmins. The island does not produce sufficient subsistence for the support of
                    the inhabitants, who consequently import large quantities of ghee, sugar, grain,
                    &amp;c. About 150 vessels of different sizes belong to the port, and with these
                    piracies were formerly carried on, until they were checked by the British. The
                    Bate Isle pirates were the dread of all the traders on the western coasts of
                    India. The port has been improved, but is still an insignificant place. It was
                    nevertheless attacked without success, and with great loss, in 1803, by a
                    British force. But, in 1807, a treaty was entered into with the chiefs of the
                    island, by which it was agreed that a free and open commerce should be permitted
                    to all British vessels. Long. 69. 21. E. Lat. 22. 22. N.</p>
