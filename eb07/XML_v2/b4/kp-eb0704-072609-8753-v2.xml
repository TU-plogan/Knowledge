                    the degree of master of arts the year after, and read natural philosophy in the
                    public schools. In 1569 he was one of the proctors of the university, and for
                    some time after officiated as public orator. In the year 1576 he quitted Oxford,
                    and made the tour of Europe. On returning to his college after four years
                    absence, he became gentleman-usher to Queen Elizabeth; and in 1585 he married
                    the widow of Mr Bell, daughter of Mr Carew of Bristol, a lady of considerable
                    fortune. Mr Bodley was soon after sent as ambassador to the king of Denmark, and
                    other German princes. He was next charged with an important commission to Henry
                    IV. of France; and in 1588 he went as ambassador to the United Provinces, where
                    he continued till the year 1597. On his return to England, finding his
                    preferment obstructed by the jarring interests of Burleigh and Essex, he retired
                    from court, and could never <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198766?mode=fullsize"

                    public employment. He now began the foundation of the Bodleian li- <hi
                        rend="subscript"> l</hi> brary, which was completed in 1599. Soon after the
                    ac- ' cession of King James I. he received the honour of knighthood. He died on
                    the 28th of January 1612, and was buried in the choir of Merton College. His
                    monument is of black and white marble, on which stands his effigy in a scholar’s
                    gown, surrounded with books. At the four corners are the emblematical figures of
                    Grammar, Rhetoric, Music, and Arithmetic, with a short inscription, signifying
                    his age and the time of his death. Sir Thomas Bodley was a polite scholar, an
                    able statesman, and a worthy man. Mr Granger observes, that he merited much as a
                    man of letters, but incomparably more in the ample provision he made for
                    literature, in which he stands unrivalled; and that his library is a mausoleum
                    which will perpetuate his memory as long as books themselves endure. Sir Thomas
                    wrote his own life to the year 1609; which, together with the first draught of
                    the Statutes, and his Letters, have been published from the originals in the
                    Bodleian library, by Mr Thomas Hearn, under the title of “<hi rend="italic"
