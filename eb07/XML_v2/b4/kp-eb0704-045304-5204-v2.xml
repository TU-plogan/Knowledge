                    Hastings and county of Sussex, 56 miles from London. It was the scene of the
                    conflict in 1066 which insured to William the Norman the crown of England. The
                    abbey founded by him forms a most magnificent pile of ruins, and the ancient
                    gatehouse is still in good preservation. The place is now celebrated for its
                    manufactories of the best gunpowder. There is a weekly market on Thursday, and a
                    monthly market on the first Tuesday of each month. The inhabitants amounted in
                    1801 to 2040, in 1811 to 2531, and in 1821 to 2852.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Battle,</hi> an action or engagement between the
                    forces of two armies. A battle is either general or partial; general, where the
                    whole, or at least the greater part, of each army is brought into action; and
                    partial, where only brigades, divisions, or corps d’armée are engaged. But,
                    however the numbers may vary, the great principles to be applied in délivering
                    battle are in almost every case the same.</p>
                <p part="N">It has indeed been said, by a high military authority, that there is
                    nothing invariable in the art of combats; and, looking to the endless diversity
                    of circumstances under which battles have been fought, as well as to the
                    apparent results, which are often at variance with the profoundest calculations
                    of science, the observation would seem to have some foundation in truth. But a
                    closer examination will be sufficient to convince us that this is not the case,
                    and that the maxim in question, like many others which pass <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193195217?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5217-0454"/>current in
                    the world, involves a fallacy equally glaring and dangerous. It is no doubt true
                    that, in the circumstances under which battles are fought, there is nothing
                    invariable; on the contrary, it is scarcely possible to suppose two cases, we do
                    not say alike in every particular, but resembling each other even in their great
                    or leading features. From the very nature of things, the data of the problem are
                    variable; but the grand principles by which the solution is to be evolved
                    continue immutably the same. The elements which enter into the calculations of a
                    general are constantly changing; and it is this circumstance which affords scope
                    for the exercise of his genius, his sagacity, and his military science. But it
                    would be manifestly absurd to maintain, that because the conditions are
                    incessantly diversified, the principles of the art experience equal mutations.
                    The issue of battle is always uncertain; because the calculations of the general
                    may be defective, his combinations unscientific, his foresight limited, or his
                    temperament rash and impetuous; and because, even where none of these causes <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> failure exist, events which no human sagacity could
                    have divined may occur to defeat the wisest plans and the ablest dispositions.
                    But all this implies, that if every thing could have been foreseen and provided
                    for, the result would not have been doubtful; and that the “grand chances” are
                    always on the side <hi rend="italic">of</hi> him who forms his plan with the
                    greatest sagacity, and executes it with corresponding vigour and ability. For,
                    variable as the results of battles appear, the most decisive success has
                    generally crowned the exertions of the greatest commanders; and victory in the
                    long-run has seldom failed to pay homage to science. There is nothing,
                    therefore, invariable in the art of combats, except those principles which
                    science has established as, <hi rend="italic">mutatis mutandis,</hi> universally
                    applicable.</p>
                <p part="N">A battle is not only the most imposing, but also the most important
                    event in war. It is the consummation to which all the previous combinations of
                    commanders necessarily tend; it is that grand act of war which may decide the
                    fate of kingdoms and empires, as well as that of armies and campaigns. The
                    highest and dearest interests of nations, nay even of humanity itself, may be
                    involved in its issue; and the mighty cause of civilization may be accelerated
                    or retarded according as the scales of the battle turn. It cannot, therefore, we
                    should think, be uninteresting or uninstructive, if we endeavour, by recurring
                    to the works of the great masters, to exhibit a condensed digest of those
                    general principles, by the skilful application of which the fate of battles, in
                    all ages, has more or less been determined.</p>
                <p part="N">All the combinations of a battle may be reduced to three systems. The
                    first, which is purely defensive, consists in waiting for the enemy in a strong
                    position, without any other object than that of maintaining it against him. Such
                    were the dispositions of Marshal Daun at Torgau, and of the Comte de Marsin in
                    the lines at Turin; dispositions, we may add, which proved wholly unavailing
                    against Frederick and Eugene, and forcibly exemplify the danger of receiving an
                    attack even in the strongest position. The second system, on the other hand, is
                    entirely offensive. It consists in attacking the enemy wherever he can be found,
                    as Frederick did at Leuthen and at Torgau, Buonaparte at Jena and at Ratisbon,
                    and the allied armies at Leipsic. The third system is in some sort a mean term
                    between the first and second. It consists in choosing a field of battle
                    possessing certain advantages both in a strategical and tactical point of view,
                    in order to wait there for the enemy, and, even in the day of battle, to watch
                    the favourable moment for assuming the initiative, and falling upon the
                    adversary with every chance of success. The combinations of Buonaparte at Rivoli
                    and at Austerlitz, and those of Wellington at Waterloo, as well as in the
                    greater part of his defensive battles during the peninsular war, are examples of
                    the mixed system, and must therefore be classed under this head.</p>
                <p part="N">It would be difficult, not to say impossible, to lay down any fixed
                    rules for determining when either of these two last systems, which are the only
                    suitable ones, ought to be employed. Regard must be had to the moral condition
                    of the troops of each party; to the national character, considered as more or
                    less solid or impetuous; and, lastly, to the obstacles presented by the ground.
                    These are circumstances which must always influence the decision of a general;
                    but allowing sufficient latitude for such considerations, the following
                    principles will nevertheless be found generally applicable: lóŕ, That with
                    veteran troops, and in an open country, the absolute offensive or initiative of
                    attack is always most advantageous; 2&lt;∕∕y, That in ground which, by reason of
                    its physical conformation or other causes, is of difficult access, the better
                    course is to allow the enemy to arrive in a position which has been previously
                    reconnoitred, and to assume the initiative as soon as his troops shall have been
                    exhausted by their first efforts; 3&lt;7Zy∕, That the strategical situation of
                    the two parties may nevertheless sometimes require that the positions of an
                    adversary be attacked by main force, without regard to any local consideration
                    whatever; as, for example, when it is necessary to prevent the junction of two
                    hostile armies, or to fall upon a portion of an army detached, or upon a corps
                    isolated beyond a river. In these and in all similar cases a skilful general
                    will direct an immediate and combined attack, without concerning himself about
                    any consideration extrinsic to the main object of overwhelming the body opposed
                    to him before it can be reinforced.</p>
                <p part="N">Orders of battle, or the dispositions best suited for conducting troops
                    to the combat, ought to have for their object to insure at once mobility and
                    solidity; and hence they ought neither to be too extended nor too profound.
                    An-attenuated order is weak: and troops crowded together in too dense an order
                    are paralyzed; for as the head of the mass only is engaged, disorder is easily
                    introduced, and the enemy’s artillery causes frightful ravages. To avoid this
                    double evil, and to fulfil both the conditions of a good order of battle, troops
                    which remain upon the defensive should be partly deployed and partly in columns
                    of battalions, like the Russian army under Beningsen at the battle of Eylau. But
                    troops disposed for the attack of a decisive point ought to be drawn up in two
                    lines of battalions, each of which, instead of being deployed, should be formed
                    in columns by divisions. This order presents infinitely more solidity than a
                    deployed line, the fluctuations of which deprive it of the impulsion necessary
                    for such an attack, and render it impossible for the officers to exercise the
                    necessary control over the troops. Nevertheless, in order to facilitate the
                    march, to avoid too great depth in the mass, and to extend the front without
                    materially lessening the consistence of an army, it may be advantageous to draw
                    up the infantry in two ranks. The battalions will thus possess greater mobility;
                    and, besides, they will have all the force desirable, since the three divisions
                    deployed will possess six ranks in depth, which is more than sufficient; while
                    the extended front will increase in a corresponding ratio the effect of the
                    musketry. In grounds of difficult access, as vineyards, inclosures, gardens, and
                    wooded heights, the defensive order of battle should be composed <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> battalions deployed, covered by numerous platoons of
                    sharpshooters. But the troops destined tor the attack, as well aş the reserve,
                    maybe advantageous y disposed in columns of attack by the centre. The reserve,
                    however, may be kept in part deployed until the mome∏∙</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195230?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5230-0455"/>
                <p part="N">of advance, in order, by its apparent extent, to impose on the enemy. In
                    a defensive battle upon open ground, squares of battalions may be substituted
                    for columns, by doubling the lines of two ranks so as to form four deep; and
                    each battalion will thus present a sufficient mass, with a front varying from
                    forty to fifty files. This order, which was that employed by the duke of
                    Wellington at Waterloo, appears advantageous when there is reason to apprehend
                    attacks of cavalry; for it affords at once safety to the infantry, and
                    protection to the cannoneers and train of artillery. But as it has both less
                    mobility and less impulsion than that in columns of attack, the latter has been
                    judged preferable; because, with well-disciplined troops, squares may be easily
                    formed in each battalion by a simple conversion to the right and left of the
                    division of the centre. The duke of Wellington, it is true, commonly fought
                    deployed; but, to say nothing of the incomparable military qualities of his
                    troops, his lines were generally formed four deep; so that, after all, the
                    exception is more apparent than real.</p>

                    Axes formed a principal part of the offensive arms of the Celtae. At the siege
                    of the Capitol by the Gauls under Brennus, one of the most distinguished of
                    their warriors was armed with a battle-axe; and Ammianus Marcellinus, many
                    centuries afterwards, describing a body of Gauls, states that all of them were
                    armed with battle-axes and swords. Some of these weapons have been found in the
                    sepulchres of the ancient Britons on the downs of Wiltshire and in the north of
                    Scotland. Four or five centuries ago the Irish went constantly armed with axes.
                    At the battle of Bannockburn, King Robert Bruce cleft an English champion to the
                    chine with one blow of his battle-axe. The Lochaber axe also remained long a
                    formidable weapon in the hands of the Scottish Highlanders; and it constituted
                    the principal arm of the city guard of Edinburgh till the year 1817, when that
                    body of military conservators of the peace was abolished.</p>
