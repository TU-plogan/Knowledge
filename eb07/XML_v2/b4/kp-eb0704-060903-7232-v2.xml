                    one of the principal pillars of the reformed church, was born at Vezelai in
                    Burgundy on the 24th June 1519. He was brought up by his uncle Nicholas Beza,
                    counsellor of the parliament of Paris, till the month of December 1528, when he
                    was sent to study at Orleans, and afterwards at Bourges, where, under the care
                    of Melchior Wolmar, he made extraordinary progress in learning, and imbibed the
                    principles of Calvinism. His uncle intended him for the bar; but the law not
                    suiting his disposition, he spent most of his time in reading the Greek and
                    Latin authors, and in composing verses. In 1539 he took his licentiate’s degree,
                    and went to Paris, where he fell into snares in his youth, and wrote some
                    licentious things. But sickness awakened him to a sense of his folly, and he
                    determined to perform a vow he had -formerly made of entering into the reformed
                    church. With this resolution he went to Geneva and made a public profession of
                    the reformed religion. In 1549 he accepted of the Greek professorship at
                    Lausanne, where he also read lectures in French on the New Testament to the
                    refugees of both sexes who dwelt in that city. Having settled at Geneva, he
                    adhered to Calvin in the strictest manner, and became in a little time his
                    colleague in the church and in the university. At the solicitation of some great
                    men of the kingdom he was sent to Nerac to convert the king of Navarre, and to
                    confer with him upon affairs of importance. This was when the Guises had got the
                    authority, under the reign of Francis II., to the prejudice of the princes of
                    the blood. The king of Navarre having testified, both by letters and deputies,
                    that he desired Beza might assist at the conference of Poissi, the senate of
                    Geneva consented. The assembly hearkened attentively to his harangue, till,
                    speaking of the real presence, he said, that the body of Jesus Christ was as
                    distant from the bread and wine, as the highest heaven is from the earth. This
                    produced a murmur: some cried out, “Blas-phemavit ;” and others got up to go
                    away. Cardinal de Tournon, who sat in the first place, desired the king and
                    queen either to silence Beza, or to permit him and his company to withdraw. The
                    king did not stir, nor did any of the princes; and leave was given him to
                    proceed. Throughout the whole conference he acquitted himself with great
                    ability. He often preached before the queen of Navarre, the prince of Condé, and
                    in the suburbs of Paris. After <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197245?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0704-7245-0610"/>the massacre of Vassi, he was deputed to the
                    king to complain of this violence. The civil war followed soon after, during
                    which the prince of Condé kept Beza with him; and while the prince was
                    imprisoned, he lived with Admiral de Coligni, and did not return to Geneva till
                    after the peace of 1563. In 1571 he was chosen moderator of the national synod
                    of Rochelle, and in the year after assisted at that of Nismcs; after which he
                    was present at the conferences of Montheliard, and at those of Berne. The
                    infirmities of age beginning to fall heavy upon him, he seldom spoke in public,
                    and at last left it off entirely in the beginning of the year 1600. However, in
                    1597, he wrote some animated verses against the Jesuits, on the occasion of a
                    report that was circulated of his death, and of his having before he died made
                    profession of the Romish faith. He lived till the 13th of October 1605, on which
                    day he expired. Beza was a man of extraordinary merit, and one who did great
                    service to the Protestant cause. This, however, exposed him to innumerable
                    slanders and calumnies; but he showed, both to the Catholics and Lutherans, that
                    he understood how to defend himself. He wrote, 1. A Translation of the New
                    Testament; 2. A Version of the Psalms into Latin verse; 3. A Treatise on the
                    Sacraments; 4. Some Sermons on the Passion of Jesus Christ and on Solomon’s
                    Song; 5. A Version of the Canticles, in lyric verse; 6. A French tragi-comedy,
                    entitled The Sacrifice of Abraham; and many other pieces.</p>
