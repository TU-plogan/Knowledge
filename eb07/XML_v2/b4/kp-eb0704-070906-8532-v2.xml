                    blood was used for the sealing and ratifying of covenants and alliances, which

                    was offered on their tombs as part of the funeral ceremony.</p>
                <p part="N">The blood of victims was anciently the portion of the gods; and
                    accordingly it was poured or sprinkled on the altars in oblation to them. But
                    the priests made another use of blood, namely, for divination; the streaming of
                    blood being held a prodigy or omen of evil.</p>
                <p part="N">The Roman priests were not unacquainted with the use of blood in
                    miracles; and they had their fluxes of blood from images, ready to serve a turn,
                    as, for instance, that said to have streamed from the statue of Minerva at
                    Modena before the battle at that place. But we know not whether, in this species
                    of legerdemain, their successors have not gone beyond them. How many are the
                    relations, in ecclesiastical writers, of madonnas, crucifixes, and wafers,
                    bleeding? The liquefaction of the blood of St Januarius at Naples, repeated
                    annually for so many ages, seems to transcend all the frauds of the Grecian or
                    Roman priesthood. But the chemists at last got into the secret; and Μ. Neumann
                    of Berlin performed the miracle of the liquefaction of dried blood, with all the
                    circumstances of the Neapolitan experiment.</p>
                <p part="N">Amongst the schoolmen we find a famous dispute, under Pope Pius II.
                    whether the blood of Christ, which fell from him in the three days passion,
                    retained or lost the hypostatic union; and consequently whether it was the
                    proper object of adoration. The Dominicans maintained the former, the
                    Franciscans the latter. But the Dominican doctrine gained the ascendency, as
                    being fitted to favour the profits of the monks, who becoming somehow possessed,
                    as they said, of a few drops of this precious liquor, were certain of receiving
                    ample offerings from the deluded laity, who flocked to pay their homage to the
                    sacred relic. Joseph of Arimathea is said to have first brought into Britain two
                    silver vessels filled with the blood of Christ, which by his order was buried in
                    his tomb. King Henry III. had a crystal, containing a portion of the same blood,
                    sent him by the master of the temple of Jerusalem, attested with the seals of
                    the patriarch; which treasure the king committed to the church of St Peter’s,
                    Westminster, and obtained from the bishops an indulgence of six years and a
                    hundred and sixteen days to all who should visit it. And Matthew Paris assures
                    us, that the object of the king in summoning his nobles and prelates to
                    celebrate the feast of St Edward in St Peter’s Church was chiefly <hi
                        rend="italic">pro veneratione sancti sanguinis Christi nuper adepti,</hi> in
                    veneration of the holy blood of Christ lately acquired. Divers others of our
                    monasteries were possessed of this profitable relic; as the college of
                    Bons-Hommes at Ashridge, and the abbey of Hales, to which it was given by Henry,
                    son of Richard, duke of Cornwall and king of the Romans. This supposititious
                    blood was resorted to by a great concourse of people for devotion and adoration;
                    till, in 1383, when the Reformation commenced, it was perceived to be only honey
                    clarified and coloured with saffron, as was shown at St Paul’s cross by the
                    bishop of Rochester. The like discovery was made of the blood of Christ found
                    among the relics in theabbeyof Feschamp in Normandy, pretended to have been
                    preserved by Nicodemus when he took the body from the cross, and given to that
                    abbey by William duke of Normandy. It was buried by his son Richard, and again
                    discovered in 1171, and attended with different miracles; but the cheat, which
                    had long been winked at, was at length exposed, and a relation of it is given by
                    Speed.</p>

                    a hound or dog, with long, smooth, and pendulous ears. It was a dog of great
                    use, and in .high esteem with our ancestors, being employed to recover any game
                    that had escaped wounded from the hunter, or been killed and stolen out of the
                    forest. It was remarkable for the acuteness of its smell, tracing the lost beast
                    by the blood it had spilt, from which the name is derived. This species could,
                    with the utmost certainty, discover the thief by following his footsteps, let
                    his flight be ever so rapid, and through the most secret and thickest coverts;
                    nor would it cease its pursuit till it had taken the felon. They were likewise
                    used by Wallace and Bruce during the civil wars. The poetical historians of the
                    two heroes frequently relate very curious passages on this subject, of the
                    service which these dogs rendered to their masters, and the escapes they had
                    from those of the enemy. The blood-hound was in great request on the confines of
                    England and Scotland, where the borderers were continually preying on the flocks
                    and herds of their neighbours. The true blood-hound was large, strong, muscular,
                    broad breasted, of a stern countenance, of a deep tan colour, and generally
                    marked with a black spot above each eye. Animals of this species have been used
                    in our own time in the West Indies, for hunting down the Caribbs, and other
                    equally humane purposes.</p>

                    officer of Oliver Cromwell’s, famous for his daring crimes and his good fortune.
                    He was first distinguished by engaging in a conspiracy to surprise the castle of
                    Dublin; which was defeated by the vigilance of the duke of Ormond, and some of
                    his accomplices were executed. Escaping to England, he meditated revenge against
                    Ormond, and actually seized him one night in his coach in St James’s Street,
                    where he might have finished his purpose if he had not studied refinements in
                    his vengeance. He bound his captive on horseback behind one of his associates,
                    resolving to hang him at Tyburn, with a paper pinned to his breast; but when
                    they had got <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198558?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0704-8558-0711"/>into the fields, the duke, in his efforts for
                    liberty, threw himself and the assassin to whom he was fastened to the ground;
                    and, while they were struggling in the mire, his grace was rescued by his
                    servants. But the authors of this attempt were not then discovered. A little
                    after, in 1671, Blood formed a design of carrying off the crown and regalia from
                    the Tower; a design to which he was prompted, as well by the desperate nature of
                    the enterprise, as by views of profit. And he was very near succeeding. He had
                    bound and wounded Edwards, the keeper of the jeweloffice, and had got out of the
                    Tower with his prey; but he was overtaken and seized, together with some of his
                    associates. One of these was known to have been concerned in the attempt upon
                    Ormond, and Blood was immediately concluded to be the ringleader. When
                    questioned, he frankly avowed the enterprise, but refused to discover his
                    accomplices. The fear of death, he said, should never engage him either to deny
                    a crime or betray a friend. All these extraordinary circumstances made him the
                    general subject of conversation; and the king was moved with an idle curiosity
                    to see and speak with a person so noted for his courage and his crimes. Blood
                    might now esteem himself secure of pardon; and he wanted not address to improve
                    the opportunity. He told Charles that he had been engaged, with others, in a
                    design to kill him with a carabine above Battersea, where his majesty often went
                    to bathe; that the cause of this resolution was the severity exercised over the
                    consciences of the godly, in restraining the liberty of their religious
                    assemblies; that when he had taken his stand among the reeds, full of these
                    bloody resolutions, he found his heart checked with an awe of majesty; that he
                    not only relented himself, but diverted his associates from their purpose; that
                    he had long ago brought himself to an entire indifference about life, which he
                    now gave up for lost, yet could he not forbear warning the king of the danger
                    which might attend his execution; that his associates had bound themselves by
                    the strictest oaths to revenge the death of any of their confederacy; and that
                    no precaution or power could secure any one from the effect of their desperate
                    resolutions. Whether these considerations excited fear or admiration in the
                    king, they confirmed his resolution of granting a pardon to Blood; but he
                    thought it a requisite point of decency first to obtain the duke of Ormond’s
                    consent. Arlington came to Ormond in the king’s name, and desired that he would
                    not prosecute Blood, for reasons which he was commanded to give him. The duke
                    replied, that his majesty’s commands were the only reason that could be given;
                    and these being sufficient, he might therefore spare the rest. Charles carried
                    his kindness to Blood still further, granting him an estate of L.500 a year in
                    Ireland, encouraging his attendance about his person, and showing him great
                    countenance; in consequence of which many applied to him for promoting their
                    pretensions at court. Whilst old Edwards, who had bravely ventured his life, and
                    had been wounded, in defending the crown and regalia, was forgotten and
                    neglected, this man, who deserved only to be stared at and detested as a
                    monster, became a kind of royal favourite. Blood enjoyed his pension about ten
                    years, till being charged with fixing an imputation of a scandalous nature on
                    the duke of Buckingham, he was thrown into prison, where he died on the 24th of
                    August 1680.</p>
