                <p part="N"><label type="entry">BETHESDA</label>, called in the Greek κoλu∕Λ⅛&gt;1^α
                    &lt;τgoCa- &lt;r∕xtj, and thence in the Vulgate <hi rend="italic">piscina,
                        probatica,</hi> was the Hebrew name for a pool or public bath, which had
                    five porticos, piazzas, or covered walks, around it. This bath, on account of
                    its singular usefulness, was called Bethesda, <hi rend="smallcaps">γ∏dπ</hi>
                    n*3, or <hi rend="italic">Beth-Chesda,</hi> or the “House of Mercy,” probably
                    because the erection of baths was an act of great kindness to the common people,
                    the preservation of whose health, in hot countries, required frequent bathing.
                    Some, however, will have the word Bethesda to be rrrøx <hi rend="superscript">
                        n</hi> + <hi rend="italic">Eeth-asda,</hi> the “sink-house,” or “drain,”
                    because the waters which came from the temple, and the place where the victims
                    were washed, flowed thither. From the Greek word κoλυ <hi rend="subscript">
                        l</hi> αC^gα being used by Josephus to denote the baths at Jericho, Dr
                    Macknight, in his <hi rend="italic">Harmony of the Gospels,</hi> concludes
                    against the opinion of those who affirm that this pool served for washing the
                    sheep designed for sacrifice before they were driven into the temple, and for
                    cleansing the entrails of the beasts sacrificed there; and, besides, he thinks
                    it inconsistent with the situation of Bethesda, near the sheep-gate or market in
                    the south-east wall of the city. With regard to the precise nature of the
                    miracle performed here, there has been considerable diversity of opinion. Dr
                    Mill contends that the text of the evangelist has been interpolated, and
                    proposes to omit a verse not to be found in the Cambridge manuscript, which
                    originally belonged to Beza. Dr Macknight strenuously opposes this unceremonious
                    method of interpretation; and while he maintains the integrity of the text,
                    shows that Dr Mill’s expedient leaves the difficulty which had staggered him
                    exactly where it was. Grotius thinks that the angel is said to have descended,
                    not because he was ever seen to do so, but because the Jews were persuaded that
                    God brought such things to pass by the ministration of angels. And Dr Hammond
                    supposes that the waters became medicinal by being impregnated with a healing
                    warmth from the blood and entrails of the beasts offered in sacrifice that were
                    washed there; and that the <hi rend="italic">aγγt∖ος,</hi><hi rend="italic
                        superscript"> ii</hi> angel,” or “messenger,” mentioned in the text, is not
                    to be understood of those celestial beings who are usually distinguished by that
                    name, but only of a common messenger or servant of the priest, who at a proper
                    season was sent by him to trouble the pool.</p>
