                    1615. Being recommended to Dr William Laud, archbishop of Canterbury, he became
                    his secretary; in which office he showed such capacity and diligence, that the
                    archbishop, by his diploma, created him master of arts in 1639; and in the <pb

                    year following, by letter commendatory from the same prelate, he was chosen
                    probationer fellow of All-Souls College. This obliged him to reside constantly
                    at Oxford; and on King Charles I. making that city his head-quarters during the
                    civil war, our author was selected to write a kind of journal in defence of the
                    royal cause, by which he gained great reputation. By his majesty’s
                    recommendation, he was chosen reader in moral philosophy; and this employment he
                    held till 1648, when he was expelled by the parliament visitors. He afterwards
                    retired to London, where he wrote several poetical pieces; and having adhered
                    steadily to his principles, he acquired the title of the “loyal poet,” and
                    suffered several imprisonments. While he lived thus in obscurity he published
                    some very satirical compositions, mostly levelled against the republican
                    grandees, and written with great poignancy. Upon the restoration of King Charles
                    II. our author, in reward of his loyalty, was created, on the king’s letters
                    sent for that purpose, doctor of the civil law by the university of Oxford; and
                    in that quality, as an eminent civilian, he was consulted by the convocation on
                    the question, Whether bishops ought to be present in capital cases? He was about
                    the same time elected to serve in parliament for Wilton in the county of Wilts.
                    He was knighted in November 1662; and upon Sir Richard Fanshaw’s going in a
                    public character to the court of Madrid, he was appointed to succeed him as
                    master of requests. He lived afterwards in credit and esteem, and received
                    various favours froι⅛the court; which, however, drew upon him some very severe
                    attacks from those who opposed the court. Mr Wood has treated him with great
                    severity; but his memory has been vindicated by others, particularly by Dryden,
                    Langbaine, and Winstanly. He died in Westminster, on the 4th December 1679, and
                    was interred in St Martin’s in the Fields.</p>
