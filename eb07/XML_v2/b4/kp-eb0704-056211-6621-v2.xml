                    circle of which had reference to the passion and death of Christ; they always
                    went two and two together; every day in Lent they fasted till six in the

                    not allowed to practise any voluntary austerity without leave ot their superior;
                    they never conversed in their refectory at meals, but were obliged to attend to
                    the reading of the Scriptures; and they all slept in the same dormitory, but not
                    two in a bed, and they lay in their clothes. For sma faults they were shut out
                    from meals, for greater they were debarred religious commerce and excluded from

                    and, as to incorrigible offenders, they were excluded from the monasteries.
                    Every monk had two coats, two cowls, a table-book, a knife, a needle, and a
                    handkerchief; and the furniture of their cells was a mat, a blanket, a rug, and
                    a pillow.</p>
                <p part="N">The time when this order came into England is well known; for to it the
                    English owe their conversion from idolatry. In the year 596 Pope Gregory sent
                    hither Augustin, prior of the monastery of St Andrew at Rome, with several other
                    Benedictine monks. Augustin became archbishop of Canterbury, and the
                    Benedictines founded several monasteries in England, as also the metropolitan
                    church of Canterbury, and all the cathedrals that were afterwards erected.</p>
                <p part="N">Pope John XXII., who died in 1334, found, after an exact inquiry, that,
                    since the first rise of the order, it had produced 24 popes, near 200 cardinals,
                    7000 archbishops, 15,000 bishops, 15,000 abbots, above 4000 saints, and upwards
                    of 37,000 monasteries. There have been likewise of this order 20 emperors and 10
                    empresses, 47 kings and above 50 queens, 20 sons of emperors and 48 sons of
                    kings, above 100 princesses, daughters of kings and emperors, besides dukes,
                    marquises, earls, countesses, &amp;c. innumerable. The order has produced a vast
                    number of eminent writers and other learned men. Rabanus set up the school of
                    Germany; Alcuinus founded the university of Paris; Dionysius Exiguus perfected
                    the ecclesiastical computation; Guido invented the scale of music, Sylvester the
                    organ; and they boast of having produced Ansel-mus, Ildephonsus, Venerable Bede,
                    and many others of equal or superior name. There are nuns likewise who follow
                    the rule of St Benedict.</p>
