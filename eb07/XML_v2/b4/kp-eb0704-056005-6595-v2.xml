                <p part="N"><label type="entry">BENARES</label>, a large and valuable district of
                    Hindostan, in the province of Allahabad, situated on both sides of the river
                    Ganges, between the 23d and 27th degrees of N. latitude. It contains 1200 square
                    miles of fertile soil, which produces grain, chiefly barley, wheat, several
                    species of the pea, and some rice; besides sugar, indigo, and opium. The air is
                    so cold during the winter as to render fires necessary; but for three months
                    after March it becomes so heated, by the setting in of the hot winds, as to
                    destroy all verdure. It is exceedingly populous and well cultivated, its
                    inhabitants being Hindoos, and well versed in the arts. The country from Patna
                    to Buxar, Gazypoor, Benares, and Mirzapoor, is rich and highly cultivated; while
                    the numerous clumps of mango trees give the district the appearance of a forest,
                    and afford shelter to the cattle. The country is well watered. The principal
                    rivers are the Ganges, the Goomty, the Caramnassa, and the Soane, the two latter
                    being the boundary rivers. Tissues, brocades, and ornamented gauzes, are
                    manufactured throughout the province, and in the northern parts plain and
                    flowered muslins, adapted to common uses; baftas are also fabricated in the
                    western, and sanaes in the eastern part of the province. The district furnishes
                    a proportion of the company’s opium. The chief towns are Benares, Mirzapoor,
                    Jionpoor, Chunar, and Gazypoor. In answer to some queries circulated by the
                    Marquis Wellesley in 1801, the population was returned at 3,000,000, and the
                    proportion of Hindoos to Mahommedans was as five to one. The Bengal code of
                    regulations has been extended, with little alteration, to the district of
                    Benares. The Brahmins, however, in consideration of their high character, have
                    received some special indulgence in the mode of proceeding against them on
                    criminal charges; and, when they are convicted of a capital offence, the
                    punishment of death is commutable into transportation at the discretion of the
                    government. Many of their criminal practices, however, such as holding out a
                    threat of avenging themselves on their adversaries by suicide, or by the murder
                    of one of their own children, have been subjected to the usual course of
                    punishment by law. Another tribe of Hindoos, among whom.it was customary to
                    destroy their female infants, are also subjected to trial and punishment for
                    murder. Cheit Sing, who ruled over this zemindary in 1770, was expelled in 1781
                    by the British, who since this period have had possession of the country.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Benares,</hi> an extensive and opulent city of
                    Hindostan, in the province of Allahabad, is the capital of the Benares district.
                    It has long been celebrated among the Hindoos as a seat of piety and learning,
                    as well as a noted emporium of trade. The Ganges here forms a fine sweep of
                    about four miles in length, and the city is situated on the northern bank of the
                    river, and on the outward side of the curve, which is the most elevated. It is
                    about four miles in length by two in breadth, and it rises from the river in an
                    amphitheatrical form, thickly studded with domes and minarets. The bank of the
                    river is entirely lined with stone, in which are many very fine ghats or landing
                    places, built by pious devotees, of large stones, to the height of thirty feet
                    before they reach the level of the street, and highly ornamented. These are
                    generally crowded with bathers and worshippers. ' <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    Shrines and temples, even within the limits of the river’s rise, almost line its
                    banks. The streets of this great city are so winding and narrow that there is
                    not room for a wheel carriage to pass; and it is difficult to penetrate them
                    even on horseback. The streets are considerably lower than the ground-floors of
                    the houses, which have mostly arched rows in front, with little shops behind
                    them; and above these they are richly embellished with verandas, galleries,
                    projecting oriel windows, and very broad overhanging eaves supported by carved
                    brackets. The houses are built of a very good stone from Chunar, and are mostly
                    lofty, none being less than two storeys in height, most of them three, and
                    several of five or six storeys, close to each other, with terraces on the
                    summit, and extremely small windows, for the sake of coolness and to prevent
                    inspection. The Hindoos are fond of painting the outside of their houses of a
                    deep red colour, and of covering the most conspicuous parts with paintings in
                    gaudy colours of flower-pots, men, women, bulls, elephants, gods and goddesses,
                    in all the forms of Hindoo mythology. The number of temples is very great,
                    mostly small, and stuck like shrines in the angles of the streets, and under the
                    shadow of the lofty houses. Their forms are not ungraceful, and they are many of
                    them covered over with beautiful and elaborate carvings of flowers, animals, and
                    palmbranches, rivalling in richness and minuteness the finest specimens of
                    Gothic or of Grecian architecture.</p>
                <p part="N">The mosque, which was built by Aurungzebe on the site of a Hindoo
                    temple, and in order to mortify the Hindoos, is a handsome building, placed on
                    the highest and most conspicuous point of land, and close to the river, lts
                    minarets are very lofty, and command an extensive view of the town and adjacent
                    country, and of the numerous Hindoo temples scattered over the city and the
                    surrounding plains. The Hindoo college at Benares is a large building, divided
                    into two courts, with galleries above and below. There are 200 scholars in this
                    college, who learn reading, writing, arithmetic, Persian, Hindoo law, and sacred
                    literature; Sanscrit; astronomy according to the Ptolemaic system, by which the
                    sun is supposed to revolve round the earth; and astrology.</p>
                <p part="N">Benares having from time immemorial been a holy city, contains about
                    8000 houses of Brahmins, who subsist by charitable contributions, although they
                    have property of their own. These houses are adorned with idols, and send out an
                    unceasing sound from all sorts of discordant instruments; while religious
                    mendicants from the numerous Hindoo sects, with every conceivable deformity
                    “which chalk, cow-dung, disease, matted locks, distorted limbs, and disgusting
                    and hideous attitudes of penance, can show, literally line the principal streets
                    on both sides.” Sonic are seen with their legs or arms distorted by long
                    continuance in one position; others with their hands clenched until the nails
                    have grown through at the back. A stranger, as he passes through the streets, is
                    saluted with the most pitiful exclamations from those swarms of beggars· But
                    besides this immense resort to Benares of poor [ grims from every part of India,
                    as well as from Thibet an the Burman empire, numerous rich individuals in the
                    decline of life, and almost all the great men who are disgraced<pb break="no"

                    banished from home by the political revolutions which have been of late years so
                    frequent among the Hindoo states, repair to this holy city to wash away their
                    sins in the sacred waters of the Ganges, or to fill up their time with the gaudy
                    ceremonies of thcir religion. All these devotees give away large sums in
                    indiscriminate charity, some of them to the annual amount of L.8000 or L.9000;
                    and it is the hope of sharing in those pious distributions that brings together
                    from all quarters such a concourse of religious mendicants. Bulls are reckoned
                    sacred by the Hindoo, and being tame and familiar, they walk lazily up and down
                    the streets, or are seen lying across them, interrupting the passage, and are
                    hardly to be roused, as, in compliance with the prejudices of the fanatic
                    population, they must be treated in the gentlest manner. Monkeys, also held
                    sacred, are seen clinging to all the roofs and projections of the temple.</p>
                <p part="N">But, amid all this wretchedness and fanaticism, Benares is a splendid,
                    wealthy, and commercial city; the bazars are filled with the richest goods, and
                    there is a constant bustle of business in all the principal streets. It is a
                    great commercial emporium for the shawls of the north, the diamonds of the
                    south, and the muslins of Dacca and the eastern provinces; and it has very
                    considerable manufactures of silk, cotton, and fine wool, as well as of gold and
                    silver lace; while English hardware, swords, shields, and spears from Lucknow
                    and Monghyr, and the finer manufactures of Europe, are exported to Bundelcund,
                    Gorruckpoor, Nepaul, and other tracts removed from the main channel of
                    communication by the Ganges. The inhabitants, according to a census made in
                    1803, amounted to above 582,000; and during religious festivals, the concourse
                    of people from all parts is immense. Yet the city, notwithstanding its crowded
                    population and narrow streets (the new market-place, constructed by the present
                    government, being the only square or open part in it), is not unhealthy; which
                    is probably owing to its dry situation on a high rocky bank, sloping towards the
                    river, and to the frequent ablutions and temperate habits of the people. There
                    are but few Europeans in Benares; a judge, collector, and register, with a few
                    other civil servants, constitute the whole of the company’s establishment; to
                    which may be added a few private merchants and planters. The residence of the
                    English judge and civil establishment is at Secrole, a pleasant village about
                    two miles from the city, where there is a military cantonment for a battalion of
                    sepoys. The Benares division of the court of circuit includes Mirzapoor,
                    Allahabad, Bundelcund, Jionpoor, Gorruckpoor, and the city of Benares. From
                    Benares to Calcutta by Birbhoom the travelling distance is 460 miles, by
                    Moorshedabad 565, from Allahabad 83, Buzar 70, Bareilly 345, Calpy 239, Kanoge
                    259 miles. Long. 83. 0. E. Lat. 25. 30. N. (s.)</p>
