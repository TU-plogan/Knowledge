                    M.D. a distinguished anatomist, was born in Perthshire in 1760, and died at
                    Edinburgh in 1826. After the usual routine of parochial education, Dr <hi

                    College of St Andrews, where he distinguished himself as a classical scholar. He
                    subsequently studied divinity in the same university, and was licensed as a
                    preacher by the presbytery of Dunkeld. Having repaired to Edinburgh in 1789, as
                    tutor to the family of Sir James Campbell of Aberuchill, Dr Barclay began to
                    give his attention to the study of medicine, and particularly to anatomy, both
                    human and comparative. He became assistant to the latc Mr John Bell, and took
                    the degree of doctor of physic in the university of Edinburgh in 1796, after
                    having defended an inaugural dissertation, <hi rend="italic">De Anima, seu

                        xml:id="kp-eb0704-4229-0378"/>assiduity with which Dr Barclay prosecuted his
                    inquiries in this interesting field of research.</p>
                <p part="N">Immediately after his graduation, having determined, it is believed
                    somewhat suddenly, to come forward as a teacher of anatomy, he repaired to
                    London, and studied for some time under the late Dr Marshall of Thavies Inn, at
                    that time a very distinguished teacher of anatomy in the metropolis.</p>
                <p part="N">Soon after his return from London, Dr Barclay commenced his lectures on
                    anatomy in Edinburgh in November 1797; and by his punctual attention to his
                    engagements, and assiduous devotion to the instruction of his pupils, he
                    speedily attracted a respectable audience, which continued gradually to increase
                    in numbers until the period of his retirement, a short time before his
                    death.</p>
                <p part="N">Of Dr Barclay’s professional writings, the earliest, we believe, was the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Physiology,</hi> which he furnished for the third
                    edition of this work.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1803, six years after he commenced his career as a teacher, Dr
                    Barclay attempted a reform in the language of anatomy, with a view to render it
                    more accurate and precise; a task for which his acquirements as a classical
                    scholar rendered him peculiarly fit. Although the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Nomenclature</hi> which he published upon that occasion has not yet been
                    generally adopted, we believe that the profession, with one voice, acknowledges
                    the importance of the object which he had in view, and the talent and learning
                    with which it was executed. Some of his illustrations of the defects in the
                    existing language of anatomy, particularly in the terms expressive of position
                    and aspect, were peculiarly striking, and highly characteristic of his
                    overflowing humour. “The terms <hi rend="italic">above, below, behind,</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">before”</hi> he used to observe, “would be sufficiently
                    definite if the body were uniformly to preserve the same position; and so,” said
                    he, “would be the expression in Hudibras, where the author makes Crowdero apply
                    a squeaking-engine to the <hi rend="italic">north-east</hi> side of his neck;
                    this would be sufficiently definite if one could ascertain, by compass, in what
                    particular position the fiddler stood.”</p>
                <p part="N">His next work, published in 1808, was a <hi rend="italic">Treatise on
                        the Muscular Motions of the Human Body,</hi> calculated to encourage a more
                    attentive study of the simple and combined actions of the muscles, with a view
                    to a more scientific and successful treatment of fractures and luxations; a
                    department of surgery which, even now, although illustrated by his distinguished
                    friend Sir Astlcy Cooper, can scarcely be said to be rescued from those popular
                    prejudices under which it has so long laboured.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1812 Dr Barclay published the first edition of his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Description of the Arteries of the Human Body;</hi> a work displaying much
                    acute observation and laborious research, and which may perhaps be considered
                    the most practically useful of all his writings. The labour which this work must
                    have cost him may be judged of by the fact, that he wrote no description of any
                    artery until he had studied its delineation, as given by Haller, and every other
                    standard authority, and until he had actually examined its course and
                    distribution in every preparation to which he had access; in some instances
                    repairing to Glasgow to examine the excellent collection of vascular
                    preparations then in the possession of his friend Mr Allan Burns.</p>
                <p part="N">His last publieation, completed only a few years before his death, was
                        <hi rend="italic">An Inquiry into the Opinions, Ancient and Modern,
                        concerning Life.and Organization;</hi> a work replete with learning and
                    original criticism, and well calculated to check the progress of those idle and
                    dangerous speculations by which some of our modern philosophers have been
                    distinguished. This, like all his former publications, is dedicated to Dr Ihomas
                    Thomson, professor of chemistry in the university of Glasgow, one of the
                    earliest and most distinguished of his numerous friends.</p>
                <p part="N">These several works, which afford such remarkable proofs of the
                    inexhaustible energies of Dr Barclay’s mind were undertaken and completed amidst
                    the incessant and laborious toils which his courses of anatomical lectures
                    necessarily imposed upon him. Of these he gave two very full ones every winter,
                    commencing each of them early in November, and terminating at the end of April.
                    For several years previous to his death he had also given a course of
                    comparative anatomy during the summer months. To this branch of study Dr Barclay
                    had always shown a marked partiality, not only as an object of scientific
                    research, but of great practical utility. He pressed upon the Highland Society
                    of Scotland, of which he was a distinguished member, the propriety of giving
                    encouragement to the study of veterinary medicine; and to him, in conjunction
                    with his friend Mr Robert Johnston, the public is chiefly indebted for the
                    establishment of the-veterinary school, so successfully conducted by his pupil
                    Mr Dick, under the auspices of the liberal and patriotic body above
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p part="N">At the period of his death Dr Barclay was engaged in revising and
                    preparing for the press his introductory lectures, which have since been
                    published, and contain a valuable abridgement of the history of anatomy.</p>
                <p part="N">His successful progress as a teacher of anatomy Dr Barclay always
                    gratefully attributed, in a great measure, to the patronage which, at an early
                    period, he received from the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh; and to that
                    learned and public-spirited body he bequeathed his anatomical collection, now
                    known as the Barclayan Museum, which contains many valuable specimens in
                    comparative anatomy, and some of the finest vascular preparations which arc
                    anywhere to be found. <hi rend="smallcaps">(q. q.)</hi></p>
