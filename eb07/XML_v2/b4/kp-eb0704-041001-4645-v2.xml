                    commonly called <hi rend="italic">Giraldus Cam-breηsis,</hi> or Ġirald of Wales,
                    an historian and ecclesiastic in the reigns of Henry II. and Richard I., was
                    born at the castle of Mainarpcr, near Pembroke, in 1146. By his mother lie was
                    descended from the princes of South Wales; and his father, William Barry, was
                    one of the chief men of that principality. Being a younger brother, and intended
                    for the church, he was sent to St David’s, and educated in the family of his
                    uncle, the bishop of that see. In a history of his own life and actions he
                    acknowledges that in his early youth he was too playful; but having been
                    severely reproached for it by his preceptors, he became a hard student, and
                    greatly excelled all his schoolfellows in learning. When about twenty years of
                    age, he was sent for his further improvement to the university of Paris, where
                    he continued for three years, and, according to his own account, became an
                    excellent rhetorician. On his return to Britain he entered into holy orders, and
                    obtained several benefices both in England and Wales. But observing with much
                    concern that his countrymen the Welsh were very backward in paying tithes of
                    wool and cheese, probably from an inability to perceive any necessary connection
                    between religion and strict regularity in satisfying the secular demands of the
                    church, he applied to Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, and was appointed his
                    legate in Wales for rectifying this and other disorders. Barry executed this
                    commission with great spirit; excommunicating all, without distinction, who
                    refused to compound matters with the church, and, in particular, delivering over
                    bodily to the Evil One those who withheld the tithes of their cheese and wool.
                    And not satisfied with enriching, he also attempted to reform, the clergy. He
                    delated the archdeacon of Brecon to the archbishop, for the unpardonable crime
                    of matrimony; and the poor man, refusing to put away his wife, was deprived of
                    his archdeaconry, which was bestowed upon the zealous legate. In a word, in
                    discharging the duties of this new office, he acted with a vigour which involved
                    him in many quarrels; but, if wc may believe himself, he was always in the
                    right, and always victorious. On the death of his uncle, the bishop of St
                    David’s, in 1176, he was elected his successor by the chapter; but this choice
                    having been made without the permission, and contrary to the inclination, of
                    Henry IL, Girald prudently declined to insist upon it, and went again to Paris
                    to prosecute his studies, particularly in the civil and canon law, and in
                    theology. He speaks with exultation of the prodigious fame which he acquired by
                    his eloquent declamations in the schools, and of the crowded audiences who
                    attended them, and were at a loss, he says, to know whether the sweetness of his
                    voice, the beauty of his language, or the irresistible force of his arguments,
                    was most to be admired. Having spent about four years at· Paris, he returned to
                    St David’s, where he found every thing in confusion; and on the expulsion of the
                    bishop by the people, which took place soon after, he was appointed
                    administrator by the archbishop of Canterbury, and governed the diocese in that
                    capacity till 1184, when the bishop was restored. About the same time he was
                    called to court by Henry II., appointed onc of his chaplains, and sent into
                    Ireland with Prince John, by whom he was offered the united bishoprics of Fernes
                    and Leighlin, but declined them, and employed his time in collecting materials
                    for his Topography of Ireland, and his history of the conquest of that island,
                    which was completed in three books in 1187. In 1188 he attended Baldwin,
                    archbishop of Canterbury, in his progress through Wales, preaching a crusade for
                    the recovery of the Holy Land; an employment in which he tells us, with his
                    usual modesty, that he was far more successful than the primate,—adding
                    significantly, that the people were most affected with the Latin sermons, which
                    they did not understand, melting into tears, and coming in crowds to take the
                    cross. Henry IL, he assures us, entertained the most favourable opinion of his
                    virtues and abilities; yet somehow that monarch would never advance him to any
                    higher dignity in the church, on account, as Barry opines, of his relation to
                    the princes and great men of Wales. But on the accession of Richard 1. in 1189,
                    his prospects of preferment brightened; for he was sent by that prince into
                    Wales to preserve the peace of the country, and was even joined in commission
                    with William Longchamp, bishop of Ely, as one of the regents of the kingdom. He
                    failed, however, to improve this favourable opportunity; and having fixed his
                    heart on the see of St David’s, the bishop of which was very old and infirm, he
                    refused the bishopric of Bangor in 1190, and that of Landaff the year following.
                    But in 1192, the state of public affairs, and the course of his interest at
                    court, became so unfavourable to Barry’s views, that he determined to retire.
                    His first intention was to return to Paris with the view of prosecuting his
                    studies; but meeting with some difficulties in this, he proceeded to Lincoln,
                    where William de Monte read lectures in theology with great applause. Here he
                    spent about six years in the study of divinity, and in composing several works.
                    At last the see of St David’s, which had long been the object of his ambition,
                    became vacant, and brought him again upon the stage. He was unanimously elected
                    by the chapter, but met with so powerful an adversary in Hubert, archbishop of
                    Canterbury, that it involved him in a litigation which lasted five years, cost
                    him three journeys to Rome at a great expense, and ended in his defeat in the
                    year 1203. Soon after this he retired from the world, and spent the last
                    seventeen years of his life in a studious privacy, composing many books, of
                    which a catalogue is given in the <hi rend="italic">Biο∙ graphia
                        Britannica.</hi> His manuscript pieces are preserved in the British Museum,
                    the library at Lambeth, and the Bodleian Library. Of his published works, the
                    best known is his <hi rend="italic">Itinerary through Wales,</hi> of which a
                    translation, illustrated with annotations, and accompanied with a life of the
                    author, was published by Sir Richard Colt Hoare, in two splendid quarto volumes,
                    in 1806.</p>
