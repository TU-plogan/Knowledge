                <p part="N"><label type="entry">BANIANS</label>, a religious sect in the empire of
                    the Mogul, who believe in metempsychosis, and therefore refrain from eating any
                    living creature, or killing even noxious animals, but endeavour to release them
                    when in the hands of others. The name of Banian is used with some diversity,
                    which has occasioned much confusion, and given rise to many mis takes. Sometimes
                    it is taken in a less proper sensę, and extended to all the idolaters of India,
                    as contradistinguished from the Mahommedans; in which sense Banians includes the
                    Brahmins and other castes. But Banians, in a more proper sense, is restricted to
                    a peculiar caste or tribe of Indians, whose office or profession is trade and
                    merchandise; in which sense Banians stand contradistinguished from Brahmins,
                    Cuttery, and Wyse, the three other castes into which the Indians are divided.
                    The four castes are absolutely separate as to occupation, relation, marriage,
                    and condition, though all of the same religion, which is more properly
                    denominated the religion of the Brahmins, who constitute the ecclesiastical
                    tribe, than of the Banians, who form the mercantile. The proper Banians are
                    called, in the Shaster, or book of their law, by the name of Shuđđery; under
                    which term are comprehended all who live after the manner of merchants, or deal
                    and transact for others, as brokers, exclusively of the mechanics or artificers,
                    who make another caste, called Wyse. These Banians have no peculiar sect or
                    religion, unless it be that two of the eight general precepts given by their
                    legislator Brahma to the Indian nation are, on account of the profession of the
                    Banians, supposed more immediately to relate to them; namely, those which enjoin
                    veracity in their word and dealings, and abstinence from circumvention in buying
                    and selling. The Banians sometimes quit their business, and, retiring from the
                    world, make a regular profession of religion, assume a peculiar habit, and
                    devote themselves more immediately to God, under the denomination of Vertea; and
                    these, although they do not thereby chan their caste, are commonly reckoned
                    Brahmins of a more devout kind; just as monks in the Romish church, although
                    frequently not in orders, are reputed a more sacred order than even the regular
                    clergy. Indeed the name Banian imports as much in the sacred language of India,
                    the depository of their written law; in which it means a people innocent and
                    harmless, void of all guile, so gentle that they cannot endure to see .either a
                    fly or a worm injured, and who, when struck, will patiently bear it, without
                    resisting or returning the blow. Their mien and appearance are thus described by
                    a modern author: <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> A people presented themselves
                    to my eyes clothed in linen garments, somewhat low descending; of a gesture and
                    garb, as I may say, maidenly, and well nigh effeminate; of a countenance shy and
                    somewhat estranged.” Gemelli Carreri divides the Banians into twenty-two tribes,
                    all distinct, and not allowed to intermarry. The author above quoted affirms
                    that they are divided into eighty-two castes or tribes, corresponding to the
                    castes or divisions of the Brahmins or priests, under whose discipline they are
                    in religious matters; although the generality of the Baniaħs choose to be under
                    the direction of the two Brahminical tribes, the Vi-salnagranaugers and
                    Vulnagranaugers.</p>
                <p part="N">The Banians are the great factors, by whom most of the trade of India is
                    managed; in which respect they are comparable to the Jews and Armenians, and not
                    behind either, in point of skill and experience, in whatever relates to
                    commerce. Nothing is bought but by their mediation. They seem to claim a kind
                        <hi rend="italic">oĩjus divinum,</hi> grounded on their sacred books, to the
                    management of the traffic, just as the Brahmins do to that of religion; and for
                    this purpose they are dispersed throughout all parts of Asia, and abound in
                    Persia, particularly at Ispahan and Gombroon, where many of them are extremely
                    rich, yet not above acting as brokers where a penny is to be got by doing so.
                    They act also as bankers, and can give bills of exchange for most cities in the
                    East Indies. Their form of contract in buying and selling is remarkable, being
                    done without words, in the profoundest silence, and only by touching each
                    other’s fingers. The buyer, loosing his pamerin or girdle, spreads it on his
                    knee, and both he and the seller having their hands underneath, by the
                    intercourse of the fingers mark in pounds, shillings, or pence, the price
                    demanded, offered, and at length agreed on. When the seller takes the buyer’s
                    whole hand it denotes a thousand; and as many times as he squeezes it, as many
                    thousand pagodas or rupees, according to the species in question, are demanded.
                    When he takes the five fingers, it denotes five hundred; and when only one, one
                    hundred; half a finger, to the second joint, denotes fifty, and the small end of
                    the finger, to the first joint, stands for ten.</p>
