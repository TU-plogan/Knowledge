                        >Francisco</hi></label>, an eminent musical performer and composer, was born
                    at Lucca about the year 1690. He studied the civil law in the university of
                    Padua; but, after a short stay there, he chose music as a profession.
                    Accordingly, he put himself under the tuition of some of the ablest masters in
                    Italy; and, having attained toacon-siderable degree of proficiency in practical
                    composition, he took a resolution to settle in England, and came thither with
                    Geminiani, who was also a Luccese, in the year 1714. He was a good performer on
                    the hautboy, and also on the flute: in the former capacity he found employment
                    in the opera band, and in the latter derived considerable advantages by
                    teaching. He published six solos for a flute with a thorough-bass, and
                    afterwards six solos for a German flute and a bass. He also converted into
                    sonatas, for two violins and a bass, the first six solos of Geminiani. He
                    continued many years a performer at the opera-house; but thinking that there was
                    a prospect of advantage for one of his profession in Scotland, he at length went
                    thither, and may be said, with greater truth than was alleged of David Rizzio,
