                <p part="N"><label type="entry">BARON</label>, a person who holds a barony. The
                    origin and primary import of this term have been much contested. Menage derives
                    it from the Latin <hi rend="italic">baro,</hi> a word which we find used for <hi
                        rend="italic">vir,</hi> a <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> stout” or “valiant
                    man ;” whence it was that those placed next the king in battles were, according
                    to him, called <hi rend="italic">barones,</hi> as being the bravest men in the
                    army; and as princes frequently rewarded with fees the bravery and fidelity of
                    those about them, the word came to signify any noble person who held a fee
                    immediately of the king. Isidore, and after him Camden, suppose the word, in its
                    original acceptation, to have meant a <hi rend="superscript"> ¢£</hi> mercenary
                    soldier;” and Messieurs de Port Royal derive it from ∕3αgoς, “weight” or
                    “authority.” But Cicero uses the word <hi rend="italic">baro</hi> for a stupid
                    brutal man; the old Germans make mention of “buffeting a baron,” meaning a
                    villain; and the Italians use the word <hi rend="italic">bαrone</hi> to signify
                    a “beggar.” Μ. de Marca thinks baron derived from the German <hi rend="italic"
                        >bar,</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ii</hi> man,” or “freeman ;” others
                    seek its origin in the old Gaulish, Celtic, and Hebrew languages; and some are
                    of opinion that it comes from the Spanish <hi rend="italic">varo,</hi> a “stout
                    noble person ;” whence wives used to call their husbands, and princes their
                    tenants, “barons.” In the Salic law, as well as in the laws of the Lombards, the
                    word <hi rend="italic">baron</hi> signifies <hi rend="italic">man</hi> in
                    general; and, accordingly, the old glossary of Philomenes renders baron
                    αv&gt;jg, “man.”</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Baron</hi> is more particularly used amongst us for
                    a lord or peer of the lowest class, or a degree of nobility next below that of
                    viscount, and above that of knight or baronet. In ancient records the word <hi
                        rend="italic">baron</hi> included all the nobility of England, because all
                    noblemen were barons even although they occupied a higher rank in the peerage.
                    But anciently it sometimes happened, that, when a baron had been raised to a new
                    degree of peerage, the two titles, in the course of a few generations, descended
                    differently, one perhaps to the male descendants, and the other to the
                    heirs-general, by which means the earldom or other superior title subsisted
                    without a barony; and there are also modern instances where persons have been
                    created earls and viscounts without annexing a barony t&lt; their other honours;
                    so that now the rule does not hold universally, that all peers are barons.</p>
                <p part="N">The origin and comparative antiquity of barons have been the subject of
                    much research amongst English antiquaries. But the most probable opinion is,
                    that they were the same with our present lords of manors; to whιc the
                    appellation of <hi rend="italic">court-baron,</hi> which is the lord s
                    court?</p>

                <p part="N">and incident to every manor, seems to give countenance. The original
                    name of this dignity in England is said to have been <hi rend="italic"
                        >vavassour,</hi> which by the Saxons was changed into <hi rend="italic"
                        >thane,</hi> and by the Normans into <hi rend="italic">baron.</hi> From
                    Magna Charta it appears that originally all lords of manors, or barons, had
                    seats in the great council or parliament; but such is the defective state of the
                    public records, that the first precept to be found is not of older date than the
                    49th of Henry III.; and this, though it had been issued out in the king’s name,
                    had neither his authority nor his sanction, since not only the king himself, but
                    his son Prince Edward, and most of the nobility who remained faithful to him,
                    were then prisoners in the hands of the rebellious barons; having been taken at
                    the battle of Lewes, in the month of May preceding, and detained in captivity
                    until the memorable battle of Evesham, which happened in August the year
                    following.</p>
                <p part="N">Before the 49th of Henry HI., the ancient parliaments consisted of
                    archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and barons. Of these barons there were two
                    sorts; the greater barons, or the king’s chief tenants, who held <hi
                        rend="italic">in capite</hi> of the crown; and the lesser barons, who held
                    of the greater by the tenure of military service. The former had a summons to
                    parliament by several writs; and the latter, if possessed of thirteen knights’
                    fees and a quarter, had a general summons from the sheriff in each county.
                    Matters continued in this state until the 49th of Henry III., when, instead of
                    keeping to the old form, the prevailing powers thought fit to summon only those
                    of the greater barons who were of their party, and, in room of the lesser barons
                    who attended with large retinues, to issue their precepts to the sheriffs of
                    counties to cause two knights in every shire to be chosen, and one or two
                    burgesses for each borough, to represent the people residing in those counties
                    and boroughs;—an innovation which gave rise to the separation into two houses of
                    parliament. Hence the title came by degrees to be confined to the greater
                    barons, or lords of parliament; and, among the peerage, no other barons were
                    admitted except such as had been summoned by writ, in respect of the tenure of
                    their lands or baronies, until Richard II. converted it into a mere title of
                    honour, by conferring it on divers persons by his letters patent.</p>
                <p part="N">When a baron is called up to the house of peers by writ of summons, the
                    writ is in the king’s name, and he is directed to repair to the parliament
                    appointed to be holden at a certain time and place, and there to treat and
                    advise with his majesty, the prelates, and nobility, about the weighty affairs
                    of the nation. The ceremony of the admission of a baron into the house of peers
                    is this: He is brought into the house between two barons, who conduct him up to
                    the lord chancellor, his patent or writ of summons being carried by a
                    king-at-arms, and presented by him kneeling to the lord chancellor, who reads
                    it. then congratulates him on his becoming a member of the house of peers, and
                    invests him with his parliamentary robe, thereafter the patent is delivered to
                    the clerk of parliament, and the oaths are administered to the new peer, who is
                    then conducted to his seat on the barons’ bench. The coronation robes of a baron
                    are the same as those of an earl, except that he has only two rows of spots on
                    each shoulder; and, in like manner, his parliamentary robes have but two guards
                    of white fur, with rows of gold lace; but, <hi rend="superscript"> ιn</hi> other
                    respects, they are the same as those of other peers. King Charles II. granted a
                    coronet to the barons, having six pearls set at equal distances on the chaplet.

                    not a lord of parliament till he be called thither by writ.</p>
