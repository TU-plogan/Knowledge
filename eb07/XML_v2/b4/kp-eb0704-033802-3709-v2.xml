                <p part="N"><label type="entry">BAMBOUK</label>, a country in the interior of
                    western Africa, situated between the Ba-Fing and the Faleme, the two great upper
                    tributaries of the Senegal. The chief characteristic of this country is the
                    quantity of gold with which its soil is almost universally impregnated. This
                    precious metal exists in a perfectly pure state, mechanically united with earth
                    or stony substances in the form of dust, grains, and sometimes little fragments.
                    Almost every spot throughout the country which is within the reach of river
                    inundation is covered with a portion of the ghingam or yellowish earth, which
                    contains gold dust. A portion of this earth is poured into a wooden vessel
                    called a calabash, which is then filled with water, and agitated till the coarse
                    earthy matters are cleared off, and there remains at the bottom a black dust,
                    which by careful washing leaves the gold dust in a pure state. Besides this
                    golden sand or earth, however, Bambouk contains several conical hills entirely
                    filled with that metal, mingled with earth and stony substances, and occurring
                    sometimes in pieces of considerable size. The mine of Semayla is the richest;
                    but the metal is there imbedded in hard substances, and can only be extracted by
                    reducing them to powder, for effecting which the natives have only a pestle of
                    hard wood, which is soon worn away by the attrition of these substances. The
                    mine of Natakon, though less absolutely rich, has the gold only imbedded in
                    softer matters, from which it can be easily extracted. In working the mine one
                    person digs out the sand or stony <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> fragments which
                    contain the gold, and hands them to another, who extracts the metal by the
                    process of pounding or agitation. The natives, finding often a rich vein
                    suddenly terminate, and coming to earth that is wholly unproductive, fancy gold
                    a capricious being, who delights in mocking their research. They often dig out
                    deep pits with perpendicular sides, which fall in and bury the unfortunate
                    workmen employed. The survivors, however, very coolly conclude that a certain
                    potent subterranean deity, whom Europeans name the devil, has carried them off
                    to assist in his own mining operations; but that he treats them well; and when
                    in digging deeper they find the bodies, they merely conclude that this
                    mysterious personage has found them unfit for his purpose, and disdainfully
                    thrown them back. We have seen no estimate, nor do there appear any data from
                    which to form one, of the quantity of gold drawn from the mines of Bambouk; but
                    it is certainly considerable, and is exported partly by way ’ of ti <hi

                <p part="N">The Portuguese, it appears, penetrated early into Bambouk, and were even
                    for some time masters of the country; but the inhabitants, inflamed by their
                    oppressions, made a general rising, and completely drove them out. Since that
                    time the people of Bambouk, with the most extreme jealousy, have excluded all
                    foreigners from their territories. The French, when they formed their settlement
                    on the Senegal, soon directed their eager search <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193193722?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3722-0339"/>towards a
                    country abounding in so valuable a commodity; but their efforts to penetrate
                    into it proved for a long time abortive. At length, in 1716, one Compagnon
                    succeeded, by great address, and not without risk, in gaining the favour of some
                    leading persons, and obtaining a view of the mineral treasures of this country.
                    David and Levens, two successive French governors, afterwards contrived to
                    effect an entrance. Sieur Brue, the most enterprising of the Governors of
                    Senegal, laid before the French administration a plan, by which, with 1200 men,
                    he undertook to conquer and maintain Bambouk. Such an expedition might very
                    probably have been in the first instance successful, and the French might
                    probably, by skilful work-i∏σ have greatly increased the produce of the mines;
                    but when we consider the various casualties and difficulties attendant on the
                    occupation of this interior region, it must appear very doubtful if this would
                    have been in the end a profitable possession.</p>
                <p part="N">Bambouk is fertile and populous along the banks of the rivers, but many
                    of the interior districts are arid and barren. There is a king, but the farims
                    or chiefs compose nearly an independent feudal body. The population is Manding,
                    yet the Mahommedan religion is professed; but the observance consists chiefly in
                    some outward ceremonies, and the marabouts or priests of that faith are
                    carefully excluded from the kingdom. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.)</hi></p>
