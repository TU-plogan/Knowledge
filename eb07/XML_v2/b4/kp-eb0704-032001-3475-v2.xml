                <p part="N"><label type="entry">BALLAST</label>, any heavy matter, as stone, gravel,
                    or iron, thrown into the hold of a ship, in order to make her sink a proper
                    depth in the water, that she may be capable of carrying a sufficient quantity of
                    sail without upsetting. There is often great difference in the proportion of
                    ballast required to prepare ships of equal burden for a voyage; the quantity
                    being always more or less according to the sharpness or flatness of the ship’s
                    bottom, which seamen call the <hi rend="italic">floor.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The knowledge of ballasting a ship with propriety certainly deserves the
                    attention of the skilful mariner; for although it is known that ships in general
                    will not carry a sufficient quantity of sail till they are laden deep enough for
                    the surface of the water to glance nearly on the extreme breadth amidships, yet
                    more than this general knowledge is required; since, if a vessel has a great
                    weight of heavy ballast, as lead or iron, in the bottom, it will place the
                    centre of gravity too low in the hold; and although this will enable her to
                    carry a great sail, she will nevertheless sail very heavily, and run the risk of
                    being dismasted in a gale by violent rolling. To ballast a ship properly,
                    therefore, is the art of disposing those materials so that she maybe duly
                    poised, and maintain a proper equilibrium on the water, without either being too
                        <hi rend="italic">stiff or</hi> too <hi rend="italic">crank,</hi> which are
                    conditions equally pernicious; for in the former case, although the ship may be
                    fitted to carry a great sail, yet her velocity will not be proportionably
                    increased, whilst her masts are more endangered by sudden jerks and excessive
                    labouring; and, in the latter, she will be incapable of carrying sail, without
                    the risk of upsetting. Stiffness, in ballasting, is occasioned by disposing a
                    great quantity of heavy ballast, as lead or iron, in the hold, which naturally
                    places the centre of gravity very near the keel; and that being the centre about
                    which the vibrations are made, the lower it is placed, the more violent will be
                    the motion of rolling. Crankness, on the other hand, is occasioned by having too
                    little ballast, or by disposing the ship’s lading so as to raise the centre of
                    gravity too high, which also endangers the mast in carrying sail when it blows
                    hard. For, when the masts are deflected from the perpendicular, they strain on
                    the shrouds in the nature of a lever, which increases as the sine of their
                    obliquity; and a ship that loses her masts is in great danger of being lost.</p>
                <p part="N">The whole art of ballasting, therefore, consists in placing the centre
                    of gravity to correspond with the trim and shape of the vessel, so as neither to
                    be too high nor too low, neither too far forwards nor too far aft; and to lade
                    the ship so deep, that the surface of the water may rise nearly to the extreme
                    breadth amidships, by which means she will be enabled to carry a good sail,
                    incline but little, and ply well to the windward.</p>
                <p part="N">Ships are said to be in ballast w hen they have no other loading.
                    Masters of vessels are obliged to declare the quantity of ballast they bear, and
                    to unload it at certain places. They are prohibited unloading their ballast in
