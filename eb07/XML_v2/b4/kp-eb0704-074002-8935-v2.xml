                        John</hi></label>, lord viscount, a great statesman, an indifferent
                    philosopher, and an admirable writer, was descended from an ancient and noble
                    family, and born about the year 1672. He had a regular and liberal education,
                    and, by the time he left the university, was considered as a person of uncommon
                    qualifications; but with great parts, he had,'as usually happens, strong
                    passions, and these hurried him into many indiscretions and follies. Contrary to
                    the inclinations of his family, he cultivated tory connections, and gained such
                    an influence in the house of commons, that, in 1704, he was appointed secretary
                    of war and of the marines. He was so closely united in all political measures
                    with Mr Harley, that when the latter was removed from the seals in 1707, Mr St
                    John resigned his employment; and in 1710, when Mr Harley was made chancellor of
                    the exchequer, the post of secretary of state was given to Mr St John. In 1712
                    he was created Baron St John of Lediard-Tregoze in Wiltshire, and Viscount
                    Bolingbroke. But being overlooked in the bestowal of vacant ribbons of the order
                    of the garter, he resented the affront, renounced the friendship of Harley then
                    earl of Oxford, and made his court to the whigs. Nevertheless on the accession
                    of George I. the seals were taken from him; and being informed that a resolution
                    was taken to pursue him to the scaffold, for his conduct regarding the treaty of
                    Utrecht, he withdrew into France. Here hc accepted an invitation to enter into
                    the Pretender’s service, and received the seals as bis secretary; but he was as
                    unfortunate in his ncw connections as in those which he had renounced; for the
                    year 1715 had scarcely expired, when, at the same time that he was attainted of
                    high treason at home, the seals and papers of his foreign secretary’s office
                    were taken from him; and this was followed by an accusation from the Pretender
                    and his party, of neglect, incapacity, and treachery. Such a complication of
                    distressful events threw him into a state of reflection that produced a <hi

                    Boethius, which he wrote the same year under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Heflections upon Exile;</hi> and the following year he drew up a
                    vindication of his conduct with respect to the tories, in the form of <hi
                        rend="italic">A Letter to Sir William Wyndham.</hi> About this time he
                    espoused as his second wife a niece of the famous Madame Maintenon, and widow of
                    the Marquis de Villette, with whom he received a very large fortune. In 1723,
                    the king was prevailed on to grant him a free pardon, and he returned in
                    consequence to England; but he was by no means satisfied with being a mere
                    titular lord, and remaining excluded from the house of peers. This stigma
                    operated to fix his hatred of Sir Robert Walpole, to whose secret enmity he
                    attributed his not receiving the full extent of the kings clemency. Hence he
                    distinguished himself by a multitude of political writings, chiefly directed
                    against that minister, till the year 1735; when, being thoroughly convinced that
                    the door was finally shut against him, he returned once more to France. In this
                    foreign retreat he began his <hi rend="italic">Letters on the Study and Use of

                    to whom they are addressed. Upon the death of his father, who lived to be
                    extremely old, he settled at Battersea, the ancient seat of his family, where he
                    passed the remainder of his life in philosophical retirement, uniting, as we are
                    told by his admirers, the wit of Horace with the dignity of Pliny and the wisdom
                    of Socrates. Pope and Swift, the one the greatest poet, the other the greatest
                    wit of the time, were completely devoted to him; and it is well known that the
                    former received from him the materials <pb break="no"
