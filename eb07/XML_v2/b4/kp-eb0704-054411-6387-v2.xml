                    Justinian’s army, who overthrew the Persians in the East, the Vandals in Africa,
                    the Goths in Italy, and, in a degenerate age, renewed the victories and triumphs
                    which had immortalized the glorious times of the republic. But notwithstanding
                    all his exploits, this great commander was falsely accused of a conspiracy
                    against the emperor’s life. The real conspirators had been detected and seized,
                    with daggers hidden under their garments; and one of them died by his own hand,
                    while the other was dragged from the sanctuary, to which he had fled for refuge.
                    Pressed by remorse, or tempted by the hopes of safety, the latter accused two
                    officers of the household of Belisarius; and torture forced them to declare that
                    they had acted according to the secret instructions of their patron. But
                    posterity will not hastily believe that a hero who in the vigour of life had
                    disdained the fairest öfters of ambition and revenge, should stoop to the murder
                    of his prince, whom he could not expect long to survive. His followers were
                    impatient to fly; but flight must have been sup ported by rebellion, and he had
                    lived enough for nature and for glory. Belisarius appeared before the council
                    wit less of fear than of indignation; after forty years service, the emperor
                    prejudged his case; and injustice was sa∏ctι-fied by the presence and authority
                    of the patriarch. 1 <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi><pb break="no"

                    venerable veteran was indeed spared; but his fortunes were sequestrated, and for
                    upwards of six months he was kept a close prisoner in his own palace. At length
                    lιis innocence was acknowledged, and his freedom and honours were restored; but
                    death, which might have been hastened by grief and resentment, removed him from
                    the world about eight months after his deliverance. That he was deprived of his
                    sight, and reduced to beg charity in the streets, uttering the doleful
                    solicitation of <hi rend="italic">Date obolum Belisαrio, “</hi> give a penny to
                    Belisarius,” is a fiction of later times, which has obtained credit as a
                    supposed instance of extreme vicissitude of fortune. This idle fable seems to
                    have been derived from a work of the twelfth century, entitled the Chiliads, by
                    John Tzetzes, a monk, who relates the blindness and beggary of Belisarius in ten
                    doggerel verses (<hi rend="italic">Chiliad</hi> iii. No. 88, 339-348, in <hi
                        rend="italic">Corp. Poet. Graec.</hi> tom. ii. p. 311), which are unworthy
                    of quotation. The tale seems to have been imported into Italy with the language
                    and manuscripts of Greece; repeated before the end of the fifteenth century by
                    Crinitus, Pontanus, and Volaterranus; attacked by Alciatus for the honour of the
                    law, and defended by Baronius for the honour of the church. Yet Tzetzes, the
                    father of the fabrication, had confessedly read in the chronicles, that
                    Belisarius did not lose his sight, and that he recovered his fortune and his
                    fame.</p>
