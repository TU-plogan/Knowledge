                    measure actually subdivided into four crotchets, and the half-measure into two,
                    the hand or foot being up, if we put it down with the very beginning of the
                    first note or crotchet, and then raise it with the third, and then down with the
                    beginning of the next measure, this is called <hi rend="italic">beating the
                        time;</hi> and by practice a habit is acquired of making this motion very
                    equal. Each down and up is sometimes called a <hi rend="italic">time</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">measure.</hi> Beating time is denoted, in the Italian music,
                    by the term <hi rend="italic">a battuta,</hi> which is usually put after what
                    they call <hi rend="italic">τecitativo,</hi> where little or no time is
                    observed, to denote that here they are to begin again to mark or beat the time
                    exactly. The Romans aimed at somewhat of harmony in the strokes of their oars,
                    and had an officer called <hi rend="italic">portisculus</hi> in each galley,
                    whose business it was to beat time to the rowers, sometimes by a pole or mallet,
                    and sometimes by his voice alone. The ancients marked the rhythm in their
                    musical compositions; but to make it more observable in practice, they beat the
                    measure or time, and this in different manners. The most usual method consisted
                    in a motion of the foot, which was raised from and struck alternately against
                    the ground, according to the modern method. This was commonly the province of
                    the master of the music, called <hi rend="italic">μίΰο- γο1ος</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">κοoυφα∣ος,</hi> because placed in the middle of the choir of
                    musicians, and in an elevated situation, in order to be more easily seen and
                    heard by the whole company. These beaters of measure were also called by the
                    Greeks m⅛ψopc⅛, because of the noise of their feet; the Latins denominated them
                        <hi rend="italic">pedarii, podarii,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >pedicularii.</hi> To make the beats or strokes more audible, their feet
                    were generally shod with a sort of sandals made of wood or iron, called by the
                    Greeks κgoιmζ∕α, %goυffαλα, % <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> 'oυ^ra, and by the
                    Latins <hi rend="italic">pedicula, scabella,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >scabilla,</hi> because resembling little stools or footstools. The ancients
                    also beat time or measure with shells, as oyster shells and bones of animals,
                    which they struck against one another, much as the moderns now use castanets and
                    similar instruments. Other noisy instruments, as drums, cymbals, and citterns,
                    were also used on the same occasion. ∙</p>
