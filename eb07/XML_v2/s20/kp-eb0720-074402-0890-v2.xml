                    an eminent printer, was born at Edinburgh in the year 1715. His father, who had
                    a small appointment in the customs, gave his son the education which every one
                    of decent rank then received in a country where the avenues to learning were
                    easy, and open to men of the most moderate circumstances. After having passed
                    through the tuition of a grammar-school, he served an apprenticeship to a
                    printer, and when a very young man removed to a wider sphere in that line of
                    business, and went to follow his trade in London. Sober, diligent, and
                    attentive, while his emoluments were for some time very scanty, he contrived to
                    live rather within than beyond his income; and though he married early, and
                    without such a provision as prudence might have looked for in the establishment
                    of a family, he continued to thrive, and to better his circumstances. This he
                    would often mention as an encouragement to early matrimony; and used to say, he
                    never had a child born that Providence did not send some increase of income to
                    provide for the increase of his household. With sufficient vigour of mind, he
                    had that happy flow of animal spirits that is not easily discouraged by
                    unpromising appearances.</p>
                <p part="N">His abilities in his profession, accompanied with perfect integrity and
                    unabating diligence, enabled him, after the first difficulties were overcome, to
                    advance with rapid success. And he was one of the most flourishing men of the
                    trade, when, in the year 1740, he purchased a share of the patent for king’s
                    printer, of Mr Eyre, with whom he maintained the most cordial intimacy during
                    the rest of his life. Beside the emoluments arising from this appointment, as
                    well as from a very extensive private business, he now drew largely from a field
                    which it required some degree of speculative sagacity to cultivate, on account
                    of the great literary property which he acquired by purchasing the copyrights of
                    the most celebrated authors of the time. Here his liberality kept pace with his
                    prudence, and in some cases went perhaps rather beyond it. Never had such
                    rewards been given to the labours of literary men, as were received from him and
                    his associates in their purchases of copyrights.</p>
                <p part="N">Having now attained the first great object of business, wealth, Mr
                    Strahan looked with a very allowable ambition on the stations of political rank
                    and eminence. Politics had long occupied his active mind, and he had for many
                    years pursued them as his favourite amusement, by corresponding on that subject
                    with some of the first characters of the age. Mr Strahan’s queries to Dr
                    Franklin in the year 1769, respecting the discontents of the Americans,
                    published in the London Chronicle of 28th July 1778, show the just conception
                    which he entertained of the important consequences of that dispute, and his
                    anxiety as a good subject to investigate, at that early period, the proper means
                    by which their grievances might be removed, and a permanent harmony restored
                    between the two countries. In the year 1775 he was elected a member of
                    parliament for the borough of Malmesbury in Wiltshire, with a very illustrious
                    colleague, Mr Fox; and in the succeeding parliament, for Wooton Basset, in the
                    same county. In this station, applying himself<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=891" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0891-0745"
                    /> with that industry which was natural to him, he was a useful member, and
                    attended the house with a scrupulous punctuality. His talents for business
                    acquired the consideration to which they were entitled, and were not unnoticed
                    by the minister.</p>
                <p part="N">In his political connection, he was constant to the friends to whom he
                    had first been attached. He was a steady supporter of that party who were turned
                    out of administration in spring 1784, and lost his seat in the House of
                    Commonsby the dissolution of parliament with which that change was followed; nor
                    did he show any disposition to resume his place on the return of the new
                    parliament. He had begun to feel some decline in his health, which had rather
                    suffered from the long sittings with which the political warfare had been
                    attended. Without any fixed disease, his strength visibly decayed; and though
                    his spirits survived his strength, yet the vigour and activity of his mind were
                    considerably impaired. Both continued gradually to decline till his death, which
                    happened on the 9th of July 1785, in the seventy-first year of his age.</p>
