                    which Old Castille, in Spain, is divided. It is generally an open and arid
                    district, with scanty water, and little to merit description, except its
                    capital, and the royal residences of Ildefonso and the Escurial, each of which
                    is described under its appropriate article. The extent of the province is 290
                    square leagues, and its population amounts to 221,379 souls. The greater part of
                    the province is destined to feed merino flocks, and the largest portion,
                    particularly those with the finest wool, are shorn within it, as the weather is
                    sufficiently warm to enable the sheep to bear that operation without feeling any
                    inconvenience. Though it grows wine, oil, and corn, the harvests are by no means
                    adequate to the consumption, and their wants must be supplied from other lands
                    than their own. It is watered by the Ebro, the Cresma, the Xarama, and the
                    Duraton; and it possesses mineral springs at Cinchon, Caballar, and Bartariejo.
                    It belongs to the captain-generalship of Zamora.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Segovia,</hi> a city of Spain, and capital of the
                    province of the same name, in Old Castille. It is situated on the right bank of
                    the river Duero, not far from its source, and near to the ruins of the ancient
                    Roman city of Numantia. Around it are most excellent pastures for sheep, and the
                    wool of the best of the merinos takes its name from this city. The usual
                    quantity of fine wool annually sent from this city is about 2,250,000 lbs., and
                    the management of such extensive concerns necessarily creates considerable
                    trade. There is in this city a manufactory of fine cloths, cassimeres, and other
                    articles composed of the native wool, which is carried on by the government.</p>
                <p part="N">The remains of antiquity in this city are, however, the most interesting
                    attractions to all travellers. The aqueduct, of very ancient construction, is
                    yet in perfect preservation, and still conveys the water to the city. It is
                    carried over one of the suburbs or arches, some of which are a hundred and four
                    feet in height; the arches are in double rows, one above the other, and on the
                    uppermost a channel is made, covered with large flag-stones, through which the
                    water runs. It is a wonderful relic of antiquity, on account of the excellence
                    of the masonry, which has withstood the ravages of time for so many centuries.
                    The period of its erection is doubtful. The Spaniards, who delight in tracing
                    every ancient monument to the highest antiquity, ascribe it to Hercules; it is,
                    however, evidently of Roman construction, and none give it a later date than the
                    reign of Trajan. It discovers as yet no marks of decay, and as the city to which
                    it conveys water is on the top of a rock, if it were demolished the inhabitants
                    would be greatly distressed for that necessary of life.</p>
                <p part="N">The ancient castle, or alcazar, is another of the curiosities of
                    Segovia. It stands on a rude mass of rocks overlooking the surrounding country,
                    whose base is washed by<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=91" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0091-0077"
                    /> a rapid and limpid stream, whilst the houses of the city stretch themselves
                    from it in both directions, and terminate in woody declivities. It is an
                    astonishing pile of building, and contains some apartments of stupendous extent.
                    The foundation and the lower part of the walls are obviously of Roman origin,
                    whilst the upper part, and what may be called the keep, are as plainly the
                    execution of the Moors, whose contrivances for shooting their arrows at the
                    heads of assailants, without being themselves subject to annoyance, are in the
                    most perfect preservation. Within this castle is a state-prison, which is well
                    described by Le Sage in his Adventures of Gil Bias. A part of the building is
                    used by the artillery department of government. The mint is below the castle,
                    and furnished with all the machinery requisite for coining money, which is
                    principally set in motion by water.</p>
                <p part="N">The cathedral of Segovia is one of the most complete specimens of the
                    later Gothic style of architecture of any religious edifice in Spain. Excepting
                    the antiquities of this celebrated city, the rest deserves little notice. The
                    streets are crooked and narrow. Many of the houses are of wood, and most of them
                    very dirty; and in spite of the great trade carried on in wool by some
                    individuals, an air of poverty pervades the mass of the inhabitants.</p>
