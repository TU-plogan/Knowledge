                    shilling, from a corruption of <hi rend="italic">siliqua;</hi> proving the

                    signified in that language a quarter of an ounce, or the forty-eighth part of a
                    Roman pound. In confirmation of this etymology, it is alleged that the shilling
                    kept its original signification, and bore the same proportion to the Saxon pound
                    as sicilicus did to the Roman and the Greck, being exactly the forty-eighth part
                    of the Saxon pound.</p>
                <p part="N">However, the Saxon law reckons the pound in the round number at fifty
                    shillings, but they really coined out of it only forty-eight. The value of the
                    shilling was fivepence, but it was reduced to fourpence above a century before
                    the Conquest; for several of the Saxon laws, made in Athelstan’s reign, oblige
                    us to take this estimate. Thus it continued to the Norman times, as one of the
                    Conqueror's laws sufficiently ascertains; and it seems to have been the common
                    coin by which the English payments were adjusted. After the Conquest, the French
                        <hi rend="italic">solidus</hi> of twelvepence, which was in use among the
                    Normans, was called by the English name of shilling; and the Saxon shilling of
                    fourpence took a Norman name, and was called the <hi rend="italic">grout,</hi>
                    or great coin, because it was the largest English coin then known in
                    England.</p>
                <p part="N">It was the opinion of Bishops Fleetwood and Gibson, and of the
                    antiquaries in general, that, though the method of reckoning by pounds, marks,
                    and shillings, as well as by pence and farthings, had been in constant use even
                    from the Saxon times, long before the Norman conquest, there was never such a
                    coin in England as either a pound or a mark, nor any shilling, till the year
                    1504 or 1505, when a few silver shillings or twelvepences were coined, which
                    have long since been solely confined to the cabinets of collectors.</p>
                <p part="N">Mr Clarke combats this opinion, alleging that some coins mentioned by Mr
                    Folkes, under Edward I. were probably Saxon shillings new minted, and that
                    Archbishop AElfric expressly says that the Saxons had three names for their
                    money: mancuses, shillings, and pennies. He also urges the different value of
                    the Saxon shilling at different times, and its uniform proportion to the pound,
                    as an argument that their shilling was a coin; and the testimony of the Saxon
                    gospels, in which the word we have translated <hi rend="italic">pieces of
                        silver</hi> is rendered <hi rend="italic">shillings,</hi> which, he says,
                    they would<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=225"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0720-0225-0207"/> hardly have done if there had been no such
                    coin as a shilling then in use. Accordingly the Saxons expressed their shilling
                    in Latin by <hi rend="italic">siclus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">argenteus.</hi>
                    He further adds, that the Saxon shilling was never expressed by <hi
                        rend="italic">solidus</hi> till after the Norman settlements in England; and
                    howsoever it altered during the long period that elapsed from the Conquest to
                    the time of Henry VII. it was the most constant denomination of money in all
                    payments, though it was then only a species of account, or the twentieth part of
                    the pound sterling; and when it was again revived as a coin, it lessened
                    gradually as the pound sterling lessened, from the 28th of Edward III. to the
                    43d of Elizabeth.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1560 there was a peculiar sort of shilling struck in
                    Ireland, of the value of ninepence English, which passed in Ireland for
                    twelvepence. The motto on the reverse was, <hi rend="italic">posui Deum
                        adjutorem meum.</hi> Eighty-two of these shillings, according to Malynes,
                    went to the pound. They weighed therefore twenty grains one fourth each, which
                    is somewhat heavier in proportion than the English shilling of that time,
                    sixty-two of which went to the pound, each weighing ninety-two grains seven
                    eighths; and the Irish shilling being valued at the Tower at ninepence English,
                    that is, one fourth part less than the English shilling, it should therefore
                    proportionally weigh one fourth part less, and its full weight be somewhat more
                    than sixty-two grains. But some of them found at this time, though much worn,
                    weighed sixty-nine grains. In 1598, five different pieces of money of this kind
                    were struck in England for the service of the kingdom of Ireland. These were
                    shillings to be current in Ireland at twelvepence each, half shillings to be
                    current at sixpence, and quarter shillings at threepence. Pennies and
                    halfpennies were also struck of the same kind, and sent over for the payment of
                    the army in Ireland. The money thus coined was of a very base mixture of copper
                    and silver; and two years after there were more pieces of the same kinds struck
                    for the same service, which were still worse; the former being three ounces of
                    silver to nine ounces of copper, and the latter only two ounces eighteen
                    pennyweights to nine ounces two pennyweights of the alloy.</p>
                <p part="N">The Dutch, Flemish, and Germans, have likewise their shilling, called
                        <hi rend="italic">schelin, schilling,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >scalin;</hi> but these not being of the same weight or fineness with the
                    English shilling, are not current at the same value. The English shilling is
                    worth about twenty-three French sols; those of Holland and Germany about eleven
                    sols and a half; those of Flanders about nine. The Dutch shillings are also
                    called <hi rend="italic">sols de gros,</hi> because equal to twelve gros. The
                    Danes have copper shillings worth about one fourth of a farthing sterling.</p>
