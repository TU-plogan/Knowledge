                        >Sleepwalking.</hi> According to a report made to the Physical Society of
                    Lausanne, by a committee appointed to examine a young man who was accustomed to
                    walk in his sleep, the disposition to this singular habit seems to depend on a
                    particular affection of the nerves, which both seizes and quits the patient
                        during<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=543"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0720-0543-0477"/> sleep. Under the influence of this affection,
                    the imagination represents to him the objects which strike him while awake, with
                    as much force as if they really affected his senses; but it does not make him
                    perceive any of those which are actually presented to his senses, except in so
                    far as they are connected with the dreams which engross him at the time.</p>
                <p part="N">If during this state the imagination has no determined purpose, he
                    receives the impression of objects as if he were awake; only, however, when the
                    imagination is excited to lend its attention towards them. The perceptions
                    obtained in this state are very accurate; and when once received, the
                    imagination renews them occasionally with as much force as if they were again
                    acquired by means of the senses. But the impressions received during this state
                    of the senses disappear entirely when the person awakes, and do not return till
                    the return of the same disposition in the nervous system.</p>
                <p part="N">The remarks of this committee were made on a lad named Devaud, who was
                    thirteen years and a half old, and who lived in the town of Vevey. He possessed
                    a robust consti tutιon; but his nervous system appeared to be organized with
                    peculiar delicacy, and to discover marks of the greatest sensibility and
                    irritability. His senses of smell, taste, and touch, were exquisite: he was
                    subject to fits of immoderate and involuntary laughter; and he sometimes wept
                    without any apparent cause. His sleep was at all times unquiet, but particularly
                    when the fits were about to seize him. During his sleep, motions were observable
                    in every part of his body, with starting and palpitations; he uttered broken
                    words, sometimes sat up in his bed and lay down again. He then began to
                    pronounce words more distinctly, and rising abruptly, acted as he was instigated
                    by the dream which then possessed him.</p>
                <p part="N">From the facts which were brought under the observation of this
                    committee, they inferred that the functions of the somnambulist, while under the
                    influence of this affection, are not suspended, as to what he wishes to see, or
                    the objects about which his imagination is occupied; that he may also be
                    disposed to receive those impressions when his imagination has no other object
                    at the time; that in order to see, he is obliged to open his eyes as much as he
                    can, but when the impression is once made it remains; that objects may strike
                    his sight without striking his imagination, if it is not interested in them; and
                    that he is sometimes inform ed of the presence of objects without either seeing
                    or touching them.</p>
                <p part="N">A great number of similar instances might very easily be accumulated.
                    Such anomalous operations of the mind it is perhaps beyond the power of
                    philosophy to explain; but a very small portion of philosophy, or even common
                    sense, will enable us to dispose of another class of vagaries imput ed to animal
                    magnetism. The magnetisers are a sort of conjurers, who, according to their own
                    account, are able to superinduce a state of sleep, and, while their patients are
                    in that state, to exercise a marvellous influence over their volitions. Deleuze,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Histoire Critique du Magnétisme Animal,</hi> furnishes
                    these very edifying details: “When magnetism produces somnambulism, the being
                    who finds himself in this state acquires a prodigious extension in the sense of
                    feeling. Several of his exterior organs, usually those of sight and hearing, are
                    rendered torpid, and all the sensations which depend on them are internally
                    performed. There is in this state an infinite number of shades and varieties;
                    but in order to form a correct judgment, it must be examined in its greatest
                    remoteness from the state of waking, passing over in silence every thing that
                    experience has not established. The somnambulist has his eyes closed, and does
                    not see by the eyes nor hear by the cars; but he sees and hears better than a
                    waking man. He sees and hears only those with whom he is in relation. He sees
                    only that which he looks at, and he usually looks only at those objects to which
                    his attention is directed. He is subject to the will of his magnetiser for every
                    thing that cannot harm him, and for every thing that is not opposed to his ideas
                    of justice and truth. He feels the will of his magnetiser; he perceives the
                    magnetic fluid; he sees, or rather he feels, the interior of his own body, and
                    those of others; but he usu ally remarks only the parts which are not in the
                    natural state, and which disturb the harmony of the economy; he retraces in his
                    memory the remembrance of things which he had forgotten while awake; he has
                    previsions and presensations, which may be erroneous in several circumstances,
                    and which are limited in their extent; he expresses himself with a surprising
                    facility; he is not exempt from vanity; he improves of himself, for a certain
                    length of time, if he is wisely managed; he spoils if he is ill directed. When
                    he reenters into the natural state, he absolutely loses the recollection of all
                    sensations, and of all ideas which he has had in the state of somnambulism; so
                    that these two states are as unconnected with one another, as if the
                    somnambulist and the waking man were two different beings.” The simple
                    enunciation of such absurdities as these, seems to preclude the necessity of all
                    formal discussion.</p>
                <p part="N">In addition to their other attributes, some of the magnetic
                    somnambulists are endowed with a miraculous skill in physic. “Those patients in
                    crisis,” says Cloquet, “who are named physicians, have a supernatural power, by
                    which, on touching a patient who is presented to them, on carrying the hand even
                    above the clothes, they feel what is the affected organ, the suffering part;
                    they declare it, and mention nearly the suitable remedies. A singularity not
                    less remarkable than all those which I have enumerated is, that those physicians
                    who for several hours have touched pa ticnts, and have reasoned with them,
                    remember nothing, absolutely nothing, when the master pleases to disenchant
                    them, and to restore them to their natural state. The time which has elapsed
                    from their entrance into the crisis to their coming out of it, is, so to speak,
                    annihilated to such a de gree, that if a covered table be presented to these
                    sleeping physicians, they will eat and drink; and if, the table being uncovered,
                    the master restores them to their natural state, they will have no recollection
                    of having done so. The master has the power not only, as I have already said, to
                    make himself be understood by these physicians in crisis, but I have repeatedly
                    seen him present from a distance his finger to one of these physicians, always
                    in crisis, and in a state of spasmodic sleep, make him to follow him where he
                    pleas ed, or send him to a distance from himself, either to his house or to
                    different places, which he mentally indicated without telling him.”</p>
                <p part="N">Another phenomenon, equally worthy of admiration, is the power of
                    reading without the aid of eyes. Pigeaire, a physician of Montpellier, is
                    answerable for the following statement of his daughter's performances in this
                    new department. “We made her read with her eyes closed by magnetic sleep, or
                    covered with a handkerchief in the form of a bandage; she read with the greatest
                    facility characters printed or written, not only in applying her fingers to the
                    paper, but also with a plate of glass interposed between the book and her
                    fingers. More than forty persons have been witnesses of this experiment, which
                    we took care to perform before only a few persons at a time, in order not to
                    disturb the little somnambulist. This experiment has never failed; once only it
                    has been incomplete. The little girl, in the state of somnambulism, named
                    certain objects en closed in snuffboxes; announced persons previously to their
                    entrance into the room in which she was; and several times mentioned the hour
                    and the minute on a hunting watch which she held in her hand.” Those who are
                    acquainted with the waking performances of Miss Macavoy of Liverpool, will
                    experience no difficulty in understanding the sleeping performances of Miss
                    Pigeaire of Montpellier.<pb break="no"
