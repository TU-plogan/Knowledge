                sample="complete" type="entry">
                <p part="N"><label type="entry">SHORE</label>, a place which is washed by the sea,
                    or by some large river.</p>
                <p part="N">Count Marsigli divides the sea-shore into three portions; the first of
                    which is that tract of land which the sea just reaches in storms and high tides,
                    but which it never covers; the second part of the shore is that which is covered
                    in high tides and storms, but is dry at other times; and the third is the
                    descent from this, which is always covered with water.</p>
                <p part="N">The first part is only a continuation of the continent, and suffers no
                    alteration from the neighbourhood of the sea, except that it is rendered fit for
                    the growth of some plants, and wholly unfit for that of others, by the saline
                    steams and impregnations; and it is scarcely to be conceived by any but those
                    who have observed it, how far on land the effects of the sea can reach, so as to
                    make the earth proper for plants which will not grow without this influence;
                    there being several plants frequently found upon high hills and dry places, at
                    three, four, and more miles from the sea, which yet would not grow unless in the
                    neighbourhood of it, nor will they ever be found elsewhere.</p>
                <p part="N">The second part or portion of the shore is much more affected by the sea
                    than the former, being frequently washed and beaten by it. Its productions are
                    rendered salt by the water, and it is covered with sand, or with the fragments
                    of shells in the form of sand, and in some places with a tar-tarous matter
                    deposited from the water. The colour of this whole extent of ground is usually
                    dusky and dull, especially where there are rocks and stones covered with a slimy
                    matter.</p>
                <p part="N">The third part of the shore is more affected by the sea than either of
                    the others; and it is covered with an uniform crust of the true nature of the
                    bottom of the sea, except that plants and animals have their residence in it,
                    and the decayed parts of these alter it a little.</p>

                    celebrated mistress of Edward IV., was the wife of Matthew Shore, a goldsmith in
                    Lombard-street, London. Historians represent her as extremely beautiful,
                    remarkably cheerful, and of most uncommon generosity. The king, it is said, was
                    no less captivated with her temper than with her person. She never made use of
                    her influence to prejudice any person; and if ever she importuned him, it was in
                    favour of the unfortunate. After the death of Edward, she attached herself to
                    Lord Hastings; and when Richard III. cut off that nobleman as an obstacle to his
                    ambitious schemes, Jane Shore was arrested as an accomplice, on the ridiculous
                    accusation of witchcraft. This, however, terminated only in a public penance,
                    excepting that Richard rifled her of all her little property; but whatever
                    severity might have been exercised towards her, it appears that she was alive,
                    though sufficiently wretched, under the reign of Henry VIII., when Sir Thomas
                    More saw her, poor, old, and shrivelled, without the least trace of her former
                    beauty. Mr. Rowe, in his tragedy of Jane Shore, has adopted the popular story
                    related in the old historical ballad, of her perishing by hunger in a place
                    where Shoreditch now stands. But Stow assures us, that that street was so named
                    before her time.</p>
