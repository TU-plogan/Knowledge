                    situated on the western coast of Africa. Lat.8.10. Long. 12. 30. It is a
                    peninsula, bounded on the north by the river called sierra Leone, on the south
                    and west by the sea at Calmont creek, and on the east by a line up the Calmont
                    to the Watslod creek, and down this last to the Dunce, which is indeed a part of
                    the Sierra Leone river. These boundaries enclose a tract of country extending
                    eighteen miles from north to south, and twelve miles from east to west; but
                    there is an additional tract of country adjoining Sierra Leone, which was ceded
                    to Great Britain by an African chief in 1819. sierra Leone, as its name
                    indicates, is a mountainous tract of country, but with numerous intervening
                    valleys. The heights are covered to their summit with lofty forests, giving to
                    the distant scenery a rich and romantic appearance. The territory on the north
                    side of the river is, however, low and level. Numerous streams descend from the
                    hills, which collect into a basin called the Bay of Franca, celebrated as a
                    watering-place. The sierra Leone is more of an estuary than a river; it is
                    twenty miles in length, by ten in breadth, at its mouth. The Rokelle affords a
                    water communication for some distance into the interior. The range of the
                    thermometer at Sierra Leone is very slight, and the average heat throughout the
                    year is 82°. The rains continue for six months, and the torrents which descend
                    from the mountains deluge the plains beneath. The mountains in the vicinity of
                    Free Town, the capital, have now been cleared and cultivated, which has greatly
                    added to the salubrity of the climate. Indeed, the settlement is now stated in
                    the medical reports to be as healthy for Europeans as any other tropical
                    country, so that it is no longer the pestiferous charnel-house which it was
                    formerly considered. The edible fruits of Sierra Leone are numerous and
                    luscious, including pine apples, superior in flavour to those cultivated in
                    England;the baobab, or monkey bread, a valuable tree; oranges, plantains,
                    bananas, limes, and many others. The country is prolific in various precious
                    products of the soil, besides fruits. The animal kingdom is very abundant,
                    comprising many species of antelopes, monkeys, and other denizens of a tropical
                    country.</p>
                <p part="N">Free Town, the capital of the colony, is built upon the south side of
                    the Sierra Leone river, and at the northern extremity of the peninsula.
                    Immediately in front of the town, the river forms a bay, where there is good and
                    commodious anchorage for vessels of all classes, and timber ships of
                    considerable size proceed with facility nearly twenty miles higher up the
                    stream, for the purpose of taking in their cargoes. The town is beautifully
                    situated on an inclined plane, at the foot of some hills, on which stand the
                    fort and other public buildings, that overlook it and the roads; whence there is
                    a fine prospect of the town rising in the form of an amphitheatre from the
                    water’s edge, above which it is elevated seventy feet. It is regularly laid out
                    into streets, stretching three quarters of a mile in length, intersected by
                    others at right angles, and parallel with the river. The buildings are
                    commodious, and substantially built of stone, which at once contribute to the
                    beauty of the place, and to the health and comfort of the inhabitants. Numbers
                    of cocoa-nut, orange, lime, and banana trees, are dispersed all over the town,
                    imparting to it a peculiarly picturesque appearance. The Madeira and Teneriffe
                    vines flourish well in the gardens. Nearly all our garden vegetables are raised
                    there; and what with yams, cassada, and pompions, there is rarely any want of
                    vegetable products for the table. There are good meat, poultry, and fish markets
                    and almost every article of housekeeping can be procured at the shops of the
                    British merchants. The population of the capital may be estimated at 10,000.</p>
                <p part="N">Throughout the peninsula, several villages have been formed, viz.,
                    Leicester, founded in 1809; Regent, in 1812; Gloucester, in 1816; Kissey and
                    Leopold, in 1817; Charlotte, Wilberforce, and Bothwell, in 1818; Kent, York,
                    Wellington, and Waterloo, in 1819. These villages are generally situated in
                    different parts of the mountain, but all are connected by good roads with each
                    other, and with the capital. The two Banana islands, situated to the south-west
                    of Free Town, were ceded to the British government in 1819, by a family who
                    receive an annual payment tor them. The total population of sierra Leone is
                    about 35,000, of whom not more than 200 are Europeans; the remainder are
                    captured or liberated slaves, or their descendants, together with some native
                    Africans. Many of the colonists, besides the Europeans, possess considerable
                    wealth. The total number of slaves emancipated in sierra Leone, between June
                    1819 and January 1833, was 27,697. Some of these, no doubt, retain their habits
                    of indolence, but in general the freed African relishes liberty, and is grateful
                    for the boon conferred on him, and several, by their industry and economy, are
                    said to have acquired property amounting to L.1000 sterling. There are public
                    schools in each parish, and from 3000 to 4000 children attend them. A large
                    portion of the colony are enjoying, and all have access to, the means of moral
                    and religious instruction. Upwards of one-fourth are regular attendants on the
                    public ordinances of religion. They have built for themselves various and
                    expensive places of worship; some of them are employed as spiritual instructors
                    of their sable brethren; and all together, considering its circumstances, this
                    negro colony is composed of an orderly and well-conducted people. Agriculture
                    has not, indeed, been sufficiently prosecuted hitherto, but matters will improve
                    in this respect when population increases, and presses upon the means of supply.
                    The soil is in part very fertile, and more might be rendered so by clearing.</p>
                <p part="N">The trade of this settlement is as follows: For the year<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=393" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0393-0331"
                    /> ending December 1834, there cleared inwards seventy-three vessels, whose
                    united tonnage was 17,307. Fifty-four of these belonged to Great Britain. The
                    number which cleared outwards during the same period was eighty-four, the
                    tonnage of the whole being 19,068. This shows an increase on the previous year.
                    The total value of the imports for 1831, were L.104,639; and of the exports
                    L.81,280. Subsequent returns for 1833-4, show a decrease, which does not
                    correspond with the number of vessels which arrived at, and departed from the
                    settlement. The chief articles of export are timber, cam wood, palm oil, ivory,
                    rice, bees’ wax, gold, hides, &amp;c. In 1835, these were exported to the extent
                    of L.58,174. The chief articles imported into Sierra Leone, are cottons,
                    gunpowder, linens, salt, guns, iron, hard-wares, and cutlery, and others of our
                    own manufactures. This settlement is kept up at a considerable yearly
                    expenditure. For the five years ending 1824, it was L.75,000 per annum; for the
                    succeeding five years, it fell to about one-half that sum; but still the revenue
                    bears no proportion to the outlay. Sierra Leone is governed by a
                    civil-lieutenant governor, assisted by a council. There is a chief-justice, and
                    a vice-court of admiralty. There is also established, the mixed commission for
                    the adjudication of vessels taken in the slave-trade. A detachment of the Royal
                    African corps (blacks) is stationed in the settlement, under a
                    lieutenantcolonel.</p>
                <p part="N">This colony was founded by Great Britain with the most philanthropic
                    views. At the suggestion of Dr. Smeathmane, the negroes discharged from the army
                    and navy, after the American war, were conveyed to Sierra Leone, furnished with
                    necessaries for forming a colony in their native land. But a series of
                    calamities overtook this singularly interesting band of settlers, which obliged
                    those who escaped pestilence and the sword to take shelter on Bance island, a
                    small place. However, the Sierra Leone Company was formed in Britain in 1787,
                    and it sent out five vessels with stores, and other succours, to these black
                    freemen, together with a large reinforcement of free negroes from America. Still
                    the difficulties with which the colony had to struggle, again placed it in
                    critical circumstances, whilst in 1794, it was plundered by the French; and so
                    much had calamities accumulated, that the company entered into an arrangement
                    with the government, to place the colony under their jurisdiction. It was
                    subsequently placed under the African Institution, established for the
                    improvement of the western part of Africa. Great accessions were made to its
                    population, by sending thither the negroes taken in slave ships, and to initiate
                    them in the habits of civilized life; the Church Missionary Society undertook to
                    furnish schools and religious instructors. But the success of this body has not
                    been equal to its benevolent intentions, at least with regard to other parts of
                    Africa, little or no impression having as yet been made on the general mass of
                    the population from this quarter. Since the dissolution of the African Company,
                    Sierra Leone has again reverted to the British crown.</p>
