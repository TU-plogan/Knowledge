                <p part="N">These games lasted three days and as many nights, during which time
                    sacrifices were performed, and theatrical shows exhibited, with combats and
                    sports in the circus. The occasion of these games, according to Valerius
                    Maximus, was to stop the progress of a plague. Valerius Publicola was the first
                    who celebrated them at Rome, in the year of the city 245. The whole world was
                    invited by a herald to a feast which they had never seen before, nor ever should
                    see again. Some days before the games began, the quindecemviri, in the Capitol
                    and in the Palatine temple, distributed to the people purifying compositions of
                    various kinds. Thence the populace passed to Diana’s temple on the Aventine
                    Mount, with wheat, barley, and oats, as an offering. After this whole nights
                    were spent in devotion to the Destinies. When the time of the games was fully
                    come, the people assembled in the Campus Martius, and sacrificed to Jupiter,
                    Juno, Apollo, Latona, Diana, the Parcae, Ceres, Pluto, and Proserpine. On the
                    first night of the feast, the emperor, with the quindecemviri, caused three
                    altars to be erected on the banks of the Tiber, which were sprinkled with the
                    blood of three lambs, and then proceeded to regular sacrifice. A space was next
                    marked out for a theatre, which was illuminated with innumerable flambeaux and
                    fires. Here they sung hymns, and celebrated all kinds of sports. On the day
                    afterwards, having offered victims at the Capitol, they went to the Campus
                    Martius, and celebrated sports in honour of Apollo and Diana. These lasted until
                    next day, when the noble matrons, at the hour appointed by the oracle, went to
                    the Capitol to sing hymns to Jupiter. On the third day, which concluded the
                    solemnity, twenty-seven boys, and as many girls, sung, in the temple of Palatine
                    Apollo, hymns and verses in Greek and Latin, to recommend the city to the
                    protection of those deities whom they designed particularly to honour by their
                    sacrifices. The inimitable <hi rend="italic">carmen Seculare</hi> of Horace was
                    composed for this last day, in the Secular Games celebrated by Augustus.</p>
                <p part="N">It has been much disputed whether these games were held every hundred or
                    every hundred and ten years. Valerius Antius, Varro, and Livy, are quoted in
                    support of the former opinion. In favour of the latter may be produced the
                    quindecemviral registers, the edicts of Augustus, and the words of Horace in the
                    secular poem, “Certus undenos decies per annos.”</p>
                <p part="N">It was a general belief, that the girls who bore a part in the song
                    should be soonest married; and that the children who did not dance and sing at
                    the coming of Apollo should die unmarried, and at an early period of life.</p>
