                <p part="N"><label type="entry">STRAIN or <hi rend="smallcaps">Stress</hi></label>,
                    in <hi rend="italic">Mechanics,</hi> are terms indiscriminately used to express
                    the force which is excited in any part of a machine or structure of any kind,
                    tending to break it in that part. Thus every part of a rope is equally strained
                    by the weight which it suspends. Every part of a pillar is equally strained by
                    the load which it supports. A mill axle is equally twisted and strained in every
                    part which lies between the part of the wheel actuated by the moving power and
                    the part which is resisted by the work to be performed. Every part of a lever or
                    joist is differently strained by a force acting on a distant part.</p>
                <p part="N">It is evident that we cannot make the structure fit for its purpose,
                    unless the strength at every part be at least equal to the stress laid on, or
                    the strain exc∣ted in that part. It is no less plain, that if we are ignorant of
                    the principles which determine this strain, both in intensity and direction, in
                    relation to the magnitude and the situation of its remote cause, the only
                    security we have for success is to give to every part of the assemblage such
                    solidity that we can leave no doubt of its sufficiency. But daily experience
                    shows us that this vague security is in many cases uncertain, if we are thus
                    ignorant. In all cases it is slovenly, unlike an artist, attended with useless
                    expense, and in machines is attended with a loss of power which is wasted in
                    changing the motions of a needless load of matter.</p>
                <p part="N">It must therefore greatly tend to the improvement of all professions
                    occupied in the erection or employment of such structures, to have a distinct
                    notion of the strains to which these parts are exposed. Frequently, nay
                    generally,, these strains are not immediate, but arise from the action of forces
                    on distant parts, by which the assemblage is strained, and there is a tendency
                    to rupture in every part. This strain is <hi rend="italic">induced</hi> on every
                    part, and is there modified by fixed mechanical laws. These it is our business
                    to learn; but our chief object in this investigation is to determine the
                    strength of materials which it is necessary to oppose in every part to this
                    strain, and how to oppose this strength in such a manner that it shall be
                    exerted to the best advantage. The notions of strain and strength therefore
                    hardly admit of separation; for it is even by means of the strength of the
                    intermediate parts that the strain is propagated to, or excited in, the part
                    under consideration. It is proper therefore to consider the whole together under
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Strength of Materials.</hi></p>
