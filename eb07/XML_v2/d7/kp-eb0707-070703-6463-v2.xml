                    Stratonice, surnamed <hi rend="italic">Poliorcetes,</hi> or the Taker of Cities.
                    At the age of twenty-two he was sent by his father against Ptolemy, who had
                    invaded Syria, and he was defeated near Gaza; but he soon repaired his loss by a
                    victory which he obtained, over one of the generals of the enemy. He afterwards
                    sailed with a fleet of two hundred and fifty ships to Athens, and restored the
                    Athenians to liberty, by freeing them from the power of Cassander and Ptolemy,
                    and expelling the garrison which had been stationed there under Demetrius
                    Phalereus. After this successful expedition he besieged and took Munychia, and
                    defeated Cassander at Thermopylae. His reception at Athens, after these
                    victories, was attended with the greatest servility, and the Athenians were not
                    ashamed to raise altars to him as a god, and to consult his oracles. This
                    uncommon success roused the jealousy of the successors of Alexander; and
                    Seleucus, Cassander, and Lysimachus, united to destroy Antigonus and his son.
                    The hostile armies met at Ipsus, 299 years before the Augustan age: Antigonus
                    was killed in the battle; and Demetrius, after sustaining a severe loss, retired
                    to Ephesus. This reverse of fortune raised him many enemies; and the Athenians,
                    who had lately adored him as a god, refused even to admit him into their city.
                    But he soon afterwards ravaged the territory of Lysimachus, and reconciled
                    himself to Seleucus, to whom he gave his daughter Stratonice in marriage. Athens
                    now laboured under tyranny, but Demetrius relieved it, and pardoned the
                    inhabitants their former misconduct. The loss of his possessions in Asia
                    recalled him from Greece, and he established himself on the throne of Macedonia
                    by the murder of Alexander the son of Cassander. But here he was continually at
                    war with the neighbouring states; and the superior power of his adversaries
                    obliged him to leave Macedonia, after he had sat on the throne for seven years.
                    He passed into Asia, and attacked, with various success, some of the provinces
                    of Lysimachus; but famine and pestilence destroyed the greater part of his army,
                    and he retired to the court of Śeleucus to seek support and assistance. Here he
                    met with a kind reception; but, nevertheless, hostilities soon broke out; and
                    after he had gained some advantages over his son-in-law, Demetrius was totally
                    forsaken by his troops in the field of battle, and became an easy prey to the
                    enemy. But although he was kept in confinement by his son-in-law, yet he
                    maintained himself like a prince, <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194756476?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6476-0708"/> and passed
                    his time in hunting, and in every laborious exercise. Ηis son Antigonus offered
                    Seleucus all his possessions, and even his person, in order to procure his
                    father’s liberty; but all proved unavailing, and Demetrius died in the
                    fifty-fourth year of his age, after a confinement of three years, about 286
                    years before Christ. His remains were given to Antigonus, honoured with a
                    splendid funeral at Corinth, and thence conveyed to Demetrias. His posterity
                    remained in possession of the Macedonian throne till the time of Perseus, who
                    was conquered by the Romans. Demetrius rendered himself famous by his fondness
                    for dissipation when amongst the dissolute, and by his love of virtue and
                    military glory in the field of battle. He has been commended as a great warrior;
                    and his ingenious inventions, his warlike engines, and stupendous machines in
                    the war with the Rhodians, justify his claims to that character. He has,
                    however, been blamed for his voluptuous indulgences; and his biographer observes
                    that no Grecian prince had more wives and concubines than Poliorcetes. His
                    obedience and reverence to his father have been justly admired; and it has been
                    observed, that Antigonus ordered the ambassadors of a foreign prince
                    particularly to remark the cordiality and friendship which subsisted between the
                    parent and his child.</p>

                    orator and Peripatetic philosopher, was the scholar of Theophrastus. He acquired
                    so much authority at Athens, that he governed the city for ten years, and ruled
                    with so much wisdom and virtue that they set up thirty-six statues in honour of
                    him. By the slanders of some malicious persons in his absence, he was, however,
                    condemned to death, and his images were pulled down; but when Demetrius heard
                    it, he remarked, they could not pull down that virtue in honour of which those
                    images had been set up. He escaped into Egypt, and was protected by Ptolemy
                    Lagus. This king, it is said, asked his advice concerning the succession of his
                    children to the throne, whether he ought to prefer those whom he had had by
                    Eurydice, to Ptolemy Philadelphus, whom he had had by Berenice; and Demetrius
                    advised him to leave his crown to the former. This displeased Philadelphus so
                    much, that when his father died, he banished Demetrius; and the unfortunate
                    exile was afterwards killed by the bite of an asp. Demetrius composed more works
                    in prose and in verse than any other peripatetic of his time; and his writings
                    consisted of poetry, history, politics, rhetoric, harangues, and accounts of
                    embassies. But none of them are extant except his rhetoric, which is usually

                    disciple of Apollonius Tyanaeus, who lived in the age of Caligula. The emperor
                    wished to gain the philosopher to his interest by a large present; but Demetrius
                    refused it with indignation, and said, “If Caligula wishes to bribe me, let him
                    send me his crown.” Vespasian was displeased with his insolence, and banished
                    him to an island. The Cynic derided the punishment, and bitterly inveighed
                    against the emperor. He died in a great old age; and Seneca observes, that
                    nature had brought him forth to show mankind that an exalted genius can live
                    securely, without being corrupted by the vices of the world.</p>
