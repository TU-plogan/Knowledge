                <p part="N">The dialectica of the ancients is usually divided into several kinds.
                    The first was the <hi rend="italic">eleatica,</hi> or that of Zeno Eleates,
                    which was threefold, namely, <hi rend="italic">consecutionum,</hi><hi

                        >contentionum.</hi> The first branch consisted of rules for deducing or
                    drawing conclusions. The second embraced the art of dialogue, which became of
                    such universal use in philosophy that all reasoning was called m- <hi

                    laid aside, the philosophers did all by dialogue, it being incumbent on the
                    respondent to conclude and argue from the several concessions made. The last
                    part of Zeno's dialectics, êg/tfnxłj, Was contentious, or the art of disputing
                    and contradicting; though some, particularly Laertius, ascribe this part to
                    Protagoras, a disciple of Zeno.</p>
                <p part="N">The second kind is the <hi rend="italic">dialectica</hi><hi

                    mathematician, but another of Megara. He chiefly followed the method of Zeno and
                    Protagoras, though there are two things appropriated to him; the first, that be
                    impugned the demonstrations of others, not by assumptions, but conclusions,
                    proceeding from consequence to consequence; and the second, that be set aside as
                    invalid all arguments drawn from comparisons of similitude.</p>
                <p part="N">He was succeeded by Eubulides, from whom the so* ph istic mode of
                    reasoning is said to be derived. In his time the art is described as manifold;
                        <hi rend="italic">mentions, fallens,</hi><hi rend="italic">electra,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">obvelata, arcevalis,</hi><hi rend="italic">cornuta,</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">calva.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The third is the dialectics of Plato, which he proposes as a kind of
                    analysis, in order to direct the human mind, by dividing, defining, and bringing
                    things to the simplest form; where having arrived, and stopped a little, it
                    applies itself to explain sensible things, but with a view to return to the
                    first truth, where alone it can rest. Such is the idea of Plato’s analysis.</p>
                <p part="N">The fourth is Aristotle’s dialectics, containing the doctrine of simple
                    words, delivered in his book of Praedica-ments; the doctrine of propositions,
                    contained in his book <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Interpretatione</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that of the several kinds
                    of syllogism, explained in his books of Analytics, Topics, and Elenchuses.</p>
                <p part="N">The fifth is the dialectics of the Stoics, which they call a part of
                    philosophy, and divide into rhetoric and dialectic, to which some add the
                    definitive, by which things are justly defined; comprehending likewise the
                    canons or enterions of truth.</p>
                <p part="N">The Stoics, before they come to treat of syllogisms, consider two
                    principal topics; the one about the signification of words, the other about the
                    things signified. In reference to the former, they consider abundance of things
                    belonging to the grammarian’s province; as what, and how many letters, what is a
                    word, diction, speech, &amp;c. And, in reference to the latter, they consider
                    things themselves, not as without the mind, but as in it, or received in it by
                    means of the senses. Accordingly, they first teach, that <hi rend="italic">nihil
                        sit in</hi><hi rend="italic">intellectu,</hi><hi rend="italic">quod
                        non</hi><hi rend="italic">prius fuerit</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">sensu,</hi> whatever is in the mind came thither by the
                    senses; and that <hi rend="italic">aut incursione sui,</hi> as Plato, who meets
                    the sight, <hi rend="italic">aid</hi><hi rend="italic">similitudine,</hi> as
                    Caesar by his effigy, <hi rend="italic">aut proportione,</hi> either by
                    enlarging as a giant, or by diminishing as a pigmy, <hi rend="italic"
                        >aut</hi><hi rend="italic">translatione,</hi> as a Cyclops, <hi
                        rend="italic">aut compositione,</hi> as a Centaur, <hi rend="italic">aut
                        contrario,</hi> as death, <hi rend="italic">aut privatione,</hi> as a blind
                    man.</p>
                <p part="N">The sixth is the dialectic of Epicurus, who, though he affected to
                    despise it, yet cultivated it with vigour. He was only averse to that of the
                    Stoics, who he thought attributed too much to it, in pronouncing him alone wise
                    who was well versed in dialectics. For this reason Epicurus, though he appeared
                    to set aside the common dialectics, had recourse to another way, namely, to
                    certain canons, which he substituted in their stead; and as all questions in
                    philosophy are either <hi rend="italic">de re</hi> or <hi rend="italic">de
                        voce,</hi> he gave separate rules for each.</p>
