                <p part="N"><label type="entry">DELOS</label>, an island of the Archipelago, famous
                    in ancient history. It is said to have been originally a floating island; but
                    afterwards it became fixed and immoveable. It is held sacred on account of its
                    being the birth-place of Apollo and Diana. Anciently this island was governed by
                    its own kings. The Persians allowed the Delians to enjoy their ancient
                    liberties, after they had reduced the rest of the Grecian islands. In subsequent
                    ages the Athenians made themselves masters of Delos, and held it until they were
                    driven out by Mithridates the Great, who plundered the rich temple of Apollo,
                    and obliged the Delians to take part with him. Mithridates was in his turn
                    expelled by the· Romans, who granted the inhabitants many privileges, and
                    exempted them from all sorts of taxes. Strabo and Callimachus tell us that the
                    island of Delos was watered by the river Inapus; but Pliny calls it only a
                    spring, and adds, that its waters swelled and abated at the same time with those
                    of the Nile. At present there is no river in the island, but one of the noblest
                    springs in the world, about twelve yards in diameter, and inclosed partly by
                    rocks and partly by a wall. Mount Cynthus, whence Apollo had the surname of <hi
                        rend="italic">Cynthius,</hi> is by Strabo placed near the city, and said to
                    be so high, that the whole island was covered by its shadow; but modern
                    travellers speak of it as a hill of very moderate height. On the top of the
                    mountain are still to be seen the remains of a stately building, with a mosaic
                    pavement, many broken pillars, and other valuable monuments of antiquity. From
                    an inscription discovered there, which mentions a vow made to Serapis, Isis, and
                    Anubis, some have conjectured that on this hill stood a temple dedicated to
                    these Egyptian deities, though it is nowhere mentioned in history. The city of
                    Delos contained many noble and stately buildings, particularly the temples of
                    Apollo, Diana, and Latona; the porticoes of Philip of Macedon, and Dionysius
                    Eutyches; a gymnasium; an oval basin formed at an immense expense, for the
                    representation of sea-fights; and a most magnificent theatre. The temple of
                    Apollo was, according to Plutarch, begun by Erysichthon, the son of Cycrops, but
                    afterwards enlarged and embellished at the common charge of all the states of
                    Greece. Plutarch tells us that it was one of the most stately buildings in the
                    universe; and speaks of an altar therein, which, in his opinion, deserved a
                    place among the wonders of the world. It was built with the horns of various
                    animals, so artificially adapted to one another that they hung together without
                    any cement. This altar is said to have been a perfect cube; and the doubling it
                    was among the ancients a famous mathematical problem, which went under the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Problerηα</hi><hi rend="italic">Deliacum,</hi> and is said
                    to have been proposed by the oracle for the purpose of freeing the country from
                    a plague. So very sacred was the island of Delos held by the ancients, that no
                    hostilities were practised there, even by <pb break="no"

                    who were at war with one another, when they happened to meet in the island. Of
                    this Livy gives an instance. He mentions that some Roman deputies being obliged
                    to put in at Delos, in their voyage to Syria and Egypt, found the galleys of
                    Perseus, king of Macedonia, and those of Eumenes, king of Pergamus, anchored in
                    the same harbour, though these two princes were then making war upon each other.
                    Hence this island was a general asylum, and the protection extended to all kinds
                    of living creatures. No dead body was suffered to be buried in it, nor was any
                    woman allowed to lie in there; all dying persons, and women ready to be
                    delivered, were carried over to the neighbouring island of Rhenaea.</p>
