                            >Louis-Jean-Marie</hi></label>, a distinguished naturalist, was born at
                    Montbar, in the department of the Côte d’Or, in France, on the 29th of May 1716.
                    His father, Jean Dauben ton, was a notary in that place, and his mother’s name
                    was Marie Pichenot. In his youth he distinguished himself by the sweetness of
                    his temper, and by his diligent application to his studies. The Jesuits of
                    Dijon, under whose tuition he was first placed, noticed him in a peculiar
                    manner. Having gone through a course of what was called philosophy, under the
                    Dominicans of Dijon, his father, who destined him for the church, and who had
                    made him assume the ecclesiastical dress at the age of twelve, sent him to Paris
                    to study theology. But his predilection for natural history induced him
                    privately to study medicine. Accordingly he attended the lectures of Baron,
                    Martinenq, and Col de Villars, and likewise those of Winslow, Hunault, and
                    Antoine de Jussieu, in the botanic garden. The death of his father in 1736
                    enabled him to follow his inclination without constraint. Accordingly he took a
                    degree at Rheims in 1741, and returned to his own country with the intention of
                    following the practice of medicine. But fortune destined him for a more
                    brilliant career.</p>
                <p part="N">Montbar had given birth, about the same time, to another man of a very
                    different character, who, though possessed of an independent fortune, a robust
                    constitution, and actuated by a violent passion for pleasure, had determined
                    notwithstanding to devote himself to the cultivation of the sciences. This man
                    was Buffon. Hesitating for some time what branch of physics he should make his
                    peculiar study, he tried by turns geometry, mechanical philosophy, and
                    agriculture. At last his friend Dufay, who during his short superintendence had
                    raised the botanic garden from that state of neglect in which former naturalists
                    had left it, and who had procured for Buffon the reversion of his office, dying,
                    and leaving him his place, Buffon’s choice was fixed on natural history, and he
                    saw before him that wide field which he afterwards traversed with so much
                    reputation.</p>
                <p part="N">Natural history was at that time little else than a dry catalogue of
                    names, destitute of that methodical arrangement, of that precision, and of those
                    interesting details, which have since distinguished it. It occupied a very low
                    station among the sciences, and instead of being a fashionable study, was
                    degraded into the drudge of medicine and surgery. Buffon formed the bold plan of
                    giving life to this dry and apparently sterile mass, of painting nature as she
                    is, always young, always active; of pointing out the harmony of all her parts,
                    and the laws by which they are combined into one system, and of giving his
                    picture all the glow, freshness, and charms of nature herself. But, to secure
                    success, it was necessary to make truth the basis of his system. Every thing
                    must be collected, revised, and examined. The forms and dimensions of animals
                    must be compared, and their internal structure ascertained. The ardent and
                    impatient spirit of Buffon could ill brook a task so tedious and painful, and
                    the imperfection of his sight rendered him unqualified for it. He looked about,
                    therefore, for a man possessed of sufficient judgment, patience, and neatness of
                    hand for his purpose, and at the same time modest enough to submit willingly to
                    act a secondary part. He found such a man in Daubenton, the companion of his
                    infancy.</p>
                <p part="N">The character of these two philosophers was almost opposite in every
                    respect. Buffon was violent, impatient, and rash; Daubenton was all gentleness,
                    patience, and caution: Buffon wished to divine the truth rather than to discover
                    it; Daubenton believed nothing which he had not himself seen and ascertained:
                    Buffon suffered his imagination to lead him from nature; Daubenton, on the
                    contrary, discarded from his writings every expression which was calculated to
                    mislead. They were thus happily fitted to correct each other’s faults; and
                    accordingly the history of quadrupeds, which appeared whilst they thus laboured
                    together, is the most exempt from error of any of the divisions or departments
                    which constitute Buffon’s great work on natural history.</p>
                <p part="N">Buffon drew Daubenton to Paris about 1742, and procured for him the
                    place of demonstrator of the cabinet of natural history, at first with a salary
                    of only 500 francs, but which was gradually increased to 2000. He furnished him
                    likew’ise with a lodging, and neglected nothing to secure his comfort and
                    convenience. Daubenton, on his side, devoted himself to second the views of his
                    benefactor. The cabinet of natural history, which was arranged, and in a great
                    measure collected, by bis means, proved of immense service. In the history of
                    quadrupeds, he gave the description and dissection of a hundred and eighty-two
                    species of quadrupeds. These details contained a vast number of new facts,
                    arranged in such a manner that the most curious results are often obtained
                    merely by comparing them together. This work procured for Daubenton a very high
                    reputation, and drew upon him the envy of Reaumur, who at that time considered
                    himself as at the head of natural history. But the credit and reputation of
                    Buffon was sufficient to prevent his friend from falling a victim to the attack
                    of this formidable antagonist.</p>
                <p part="N">In the subsequent parts of his natural history, Buffon was persuaded to
                    separate himself from Daubenton. This injured the precision and value of these
                    parts excessively, whilst it deprived Daubenton of 12,000 francs a year.
                    Afterwards the intimacy between them revived, and continued till the death of
                    Buffon.</p>
                <p part="N">• The number of dissertations on natural history which Daubenton
                    -published in the Memoirs of the French Academy is so great that even a list of
                    them would be too long for this place. Descriptions of different animals,
                    dissections, comparisons between the forms of ^different animals, anatomical
                    examinations of fossil bones, in order to determine the animals to which they
                    had belonged, ⅛e physiology of vegetables, and different parts of mineralogy,
                    successively occupied him; not to mention his experiments on agriculture and
                    rural economy, which, however, were of more service to him afterwards than all
                    the rest of his labours, on account of the reputation among the populace which
                    they had procured him.</p>
                <p part="N">Besides his publications, Daubenton was of great service to science as a
                    lecturer. From 1775 he gave lectures on natural history in the college of
                    medicine. In 1783 he lectured on rural economy. He was appointed professor of
                    mineralogy by the convention at the Garden of Plants, and he gave lectures
                    during the ephemeral existence of the Normal School. He was likewise one of the
                    editors of the Journal des Sçavans, and contributed to both the Encyclopaedias.
                    As a lecturer he was extremely popular, and, what is uncommon, he retained his
                    popularity to the last.</p>
                <p part="N">Notwithstanding the feebleness of his constitution, he arrived at a very
                    advanced age without much disease or loss of his faculties. This may in some
                    measure be ascribed to the gentleness of his temper, and his remarkable
                    resignation. He was temperate and moderate even in his <pb break="no"

                    Part of his time was spent in reading romances with his wife.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1799 he was appointed one of the members of the conservative
                    senate, and he resolved to attend the meeting of it. This obliged him to alter
                    his regimen. The season was severe. At the first meeting which he attended he
                    fell from his seat in an apoplectic fit. The most speedy assistance was
                    procured, and by its means he was restored to his senses. With the utmost
                    calmness he pointed out with his fingers the progress of the paralysis in
                    different parts of his body, and died without a struggle on the first of January
                    1800.</p>
