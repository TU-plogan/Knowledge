                    name of a ceremony originally used in the druidícal worship, and retained in
                    many places down to a very late period, as a civil ceremony towards persons of
                    particular distinction. The temples of the ancient Britons were all circular;
                    and the druids, in performing the public offices of their religion, never
                    neglected to make three turns round the altar, accompanied by all the
                    worshippers. This practice was so habitual to the ancient Britons, that it
                    continued in some places many ages after the druids and their religion were both
                    destroyed. In the Scottish islcs, the vulgar never come to the ancient
                    sacrificing and fire-hallowing cairns, but they walk three times round them,
                    from east to west, according to the course of the sun. This sanctified tour, or
                    round by the south, is called <hi rend="italic">deiscal,</hi> from <hi
                        rend="italic">deas</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dess,</hi> the right hand, and
                        <hi rend="italic">soil</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sul,</hi> the sun; the
                    right hand being ever next the heap or cairn. In the same isles it is the custom
                    and fashion of the people to testify their respect for their chieftains, the
                    proprietors of their several isles, and other persons of distinction, by
                    performing the deiscal round them in the same manner. A gentleman giving an
                    account of his reception in one of the Western Islands, of which he was
                    proprietor, describes the ceremony of the deiscal in this manner: “One of the
                    natives would needs express his high esteem for my person, by making a turn
                    round about me, sun-ways, and at the same time blessing me, and wishing me all
                    happiness. But I bid him let alone that piece of homage, telling him I was
                    sensible of his good meaning towards me. But this poor man was very much
                    disappointed, as were also his neighbours; for they doubted not but this ancient
                    ceremony would have been very acceptable to me; and one of them told me that
                    this was a thing due to my character from them as to their chief and patron, and
