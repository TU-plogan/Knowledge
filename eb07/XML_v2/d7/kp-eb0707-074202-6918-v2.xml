                    to have happened in his time <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 1500) is supposed
                    to have been only an inundation of that country, occasioned by heavy rains, and
                    an earthquake which stopped the course of the river Pencus at the place where it
                    previously •discharged itself into the sea. On these circumstances the fable of
                    Deucalion's flood is founded. According to the story, he was the son of
                    Prometheus, and governed his people with equity; but the rest of mankind having
                    become extremely wicked, were destroyed by a flood, whilst Deucalion and Pyrrha,
                    his queen, were enabled to save themselves by ascending Mount Parnassus. When
                    the waters had decreased, they went and consulted the oracle of Themis as to the
                    means by which the earth was to be repeopled, when they were ordered to veil
                    their heads and faces, to unloose their girdles, and to throw behind their backs
                    the bones of their great mother. At this advice Pyrrha was seized with horror;
                    but Deucalion explained the mystery, by observing, that their great mother must
                    mean the earth, and her bones the stones; upon which they took up some, when
                    those which Deucalion threw over his head became men, and those thrown by Pyrrha
                    women. Some have supposed that Deucalion, whom the Greeks have represented under
                    a variety of characters, and concerning whom their poets have given many
                    fabulous accounts, was the same with the patriarch Noah; and that Deucalion’s
                    flood in Thessaly, as well as that of Ogyges in Attica, and of Prometheus in
                    Egypt, were the same with that of Noah recorded in Scripture. Diodorus Siculus
                    expressly says, that in the deluge which happened in the time of Deucalion
                    almost all flesh died; and Apollodorus having mentioned Deucalion <hi

                        rend="italic">consigned to the arh,</hi> takes notice, upon his quitting it,
                    of his offering up an immediate sacrifice, ∆π puξ∕ω, <hi rend="italic">to the
                        God who delivered him.</hi> As he was the father of mankind, the ancients
                    conferred on him great dignity and universal monarchy, though sometimes he is
                    reduced to the state of a petty king of Thessaly. Apollonius Rhodius makes him a
                    native of Greece, and the son of Prometheus. From their confused history,
                    however, we may learn, that the person represented was the first of men, through
                    whom religious rites were renewed, cities built, and civil polity established in
                    the world; none of which circumstances are applicable to any king of Greece.
                    Philo assures us that the Grecians call this person Deucalion, but the Chaldeans
                    style him Noe, in whose time there happened the great eruption of waters. But as
                    Lucian has given the most particular history of the deluge, and that which comes
                    nearest to the account given by Moses, and as he was a native of Samosata, a
                    city of Commagene, upon the Euphrates, a part of the world where memorials of
                    the deluge were particularly preserved, and where an obvious reference to that
                    history may be observed in the rites and worship of the country, we shall state
                    the substance of what he says on the subject. Having described Noah under the
                    name of Deucalion, he states that the present race of mankind are different from
                    those who formerly existed; for those of the antediluvian world were all
                    destroyed. The present world was peopled by the sons of Deucalion, its
                    inhabitants having increased to so great a number from one person. In respect to
                    the former brood, they were men of violence, and lawless in their dealings; they
                    regarded not oaths, nor observed the rites of hospi- -tālity, or showed mercy to
                    those who sued for it. On this account they were doomed to destruction, for
                    which purpose there was a mighty eruption of waters from the earth, attended
                    with heavy showers from above, so that the rivers swelled and the sea
                    overflowed, till the whole earth was covered with a flood, and all flesh
                    drowned. Deucalion alone was preserved, in order to repeople the world; and this
                    mercy was shown to him on account of his justice and piety. His preservation was
                    effected by putting all his family, both his sons and their wives, into a vast
                    ark which he had provided, and also by entering it himself. At the same time
                    animals of every species, boars, horses, lions, serpents, and whatsoever lived
                    upon the face of the earth, followed him by pairs, all which he received into
                    the ark, and experienced no evil from them; for by the immediate influence of
                    the Deity there prevailed a wonderful harmony throughout; and thus they were
                    wafted with him as long as the flood endured. After this he proceeds to mention,
                    that upon the disappearance of the waters Deucalion went forth from the ark, and
                    raised an altar to God. It would be needless to point out the features of
                    resemblance which this account bears to that contained in the book of
                    Genesis.</p>
