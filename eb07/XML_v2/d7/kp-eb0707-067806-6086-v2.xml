                    nature, rejecting revelation, and opposing Christianity.</p>
                <p part="N">This name seems to have been first assumed as the denomination of a

                    some gentlemen in France and Italy, who were desirous of thus disguising their
                    opposition to Christianity by a more honourable appellation than that of
                    atheists. Virot, an eminent reformer, mentions certain persons, in his epistle
                    dedicatory prefixed to the second volume of his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Instruction</hi><hi rend="italic">Chrétienne,</hi> published in 1563, who
                    called themselves by a new name, that of <hi rend="italic">Deists.</hi> These,
                    he tells us, professed to believe in God, but showed no regard to Jesus Christ,
                    and considered the doctrines of the apostles and evangelists as fables and
                    dreams. He adds, that they laughed at all religion, though they outwardly
                    conformed to the religion of those with whom they lived, or whom they wished to
                    please, or feared to offend. Some, he observes, professed to believe the
                    immortality of the soul, but others denied both this doctrine and that of a
                    providence. Many of them were considered as persons of acute and subtile genius,
                    and took pains in disseminating their notions.</p>
                <p part="N">The deists hold that, considering the multiplicity of religions, the
                    numerous pretences to revelation, and the precarious arguments generally
                    advanced in proof of them, the best and surest way is to return to the
                    simplicity of nature and the belief of one God, which is the only truth agreed
                    to by all nations. They complain, that the freedom of thinking and reasoning is
                    oppressed under the yoke of religion, and that the minds of men are ridden and
                    tyrannized by the necessity imposed on them of believing inconceivable
                    mysteries; and contend that nothing should be required to be assented to or
                    believed but what their reason clearly conceives.</p>
                <p part="N">The distinguishing character of modern deists is, that they reject all
                    revealed religion, and discard all pretences to it, as the effects of imposture
                    or enthusiasm. They profess a great regard for natural religion, though they are
                    far from being agreed in their notions concerning it. They are classed by some
                    of their own writers as mortal and immortal deists; the latter acknowledging a
                    future state, and the former denying it, or representing it as very
                    uncertain.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Clarke distinguishes four sorts of deists. 1. Those who pretend to
                    believe the existence of an eternal, infinite, independent, intelligible Being,
                    who made the world, without concerning himself in the government of it. 2. Those
                    who believe the being and natural providence of God, but deny the difference of
                    actions, as morally good or evil, resolving it into the arbitrary constitution
                    of human laws, and who therefore suppose that God takes no notice of them. With
                    respect to both these classes, he observes that their opinions can consistently
                    terminate in nothing but downright atheism. 3. Those who have right
                    apprehensions concerning the nature, attributes, and allgoverning providence of
                    God, and seem also to have some notion of his moral perfections, though they
                    consider them as transcendent, and such in nature and degree that we can form no
                    true judgment, nor argue with any certainty, concerning them, but who deny the
                    immortality of human souls, alleging that men perish at death, and that the
                    present life is the whole of human existence. 4. Those who believe the
                    existence, perfections, and providence of God, the obligation of natural
                    religion, and a state of future retribution, on the evidence of the light of
                    nature, without a divine revelation. Such as these, he says, are the only true
                    deists; but their principles, he apprehends, should lead them to embrace
                    Christianity; and therefore he concludes that there is now no consistent scheme
                    of deism in the world.</p>
                <p part="N">The first deistical writer of any note who appeared in this country was
                    Lord Herbert. He lived and wrote in the seventeenth century; and his book <hi
                        rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Veritate</hi> was first published at
                    Paris in 1624. This, together with his book <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Causis Errorum,</hi> and his treatise <hi rend="italic"
                        >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Religione</hi><hi rend="italic">Laici,</hi> were
                    afterwards published in London. His celebrated work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Religione Gentilium</hi> was published at Amster-^ dam in 1663
                    in 4to, and in 1700 in 8vo; and an English translation of it appeared at London
                    in 1705. As he was one of the first who formed deism into a system, and asserted
                    the sufficiency, universality, and absolute perfection of natural religion, with
                    a view to discard all extraordinary revelation as useless and needless, we shall
                    subjoin the five fundamental articles of this universal religion. These are, 1.
                    That there is one supreme God: 2. That he is chiefly to be worshipped: 3. That
                    piety and virtue are the principal part of his worship: 4. That we must repent
                    of our sins, and if we do so God will pardon them: 5. That there are rewards for
                    good men, and punishments for bad men, both here and hereafter.</p>
