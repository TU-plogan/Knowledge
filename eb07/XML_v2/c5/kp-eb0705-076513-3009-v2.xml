                    father after certayne years, whereby he was thought to have been born in
                    Venice.” <hi rend="italic">(Decades of the New World,</hi> fol. 255.) It also
                    appears that he returned, while still young <hi rend="italic">(jρene

                <p part="N">From an unaccountable laxity in the scrutiny of writers, considerable
                    misrepresentations relating to this extraordinary man have hitherto prevailed,
                    and obtained general credence. These hypothetical statements, so long
                    maintained, must now give place to facts, which the research of a modern writer
                    has recently brought to light, and placed upon a basis of irrefragable
                        veracity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0705-3022-0766"/>The brilliant discoveries of Columbus, towards
                    the close of the fourteenth century, awakened a spirit of enterprise throughout
                    the enlightened nations of Europe; and England was not inattentive to movements,
                    from which great and important advantages might result to her dominions. Her
                    monarch, Henry VH., however avariciously inclined, evinced great readiness to
                    facilitate and promote adventure in the novel careeι∙ opened up to human
                    ambition. The all-important and engrossing object was to discover a route to
                    India; and an expedition in a north-westerly direction, ostensibly to reach what
                    was called Cathay, or the Land of Spice, was speedily, after the discoveries of
                    Columbus, projected by Sebastian Cabot, and fitted out under the auspices of the
                    English government. The first patent, which bears date the 5th of March 1496
                    (Rymer, <hi rend="italic">Foedera,</hi> vol. xii. p. 595), was given to John
                    Cabot, and his three sons, Lewis, Sebastian, and Saucius, and authorizes them
                    “to seek out, discover, and find whatsoever isles, countries, regions, or
                    provinces of the heathen and infidels, whatsoever they be, and in what part of
                    the world soever they be, which before this time have been unknown to all
                    Christians.” The patentees were further empowered to set up the royal banner,
                    and occupy and possess all the “newly found” lands in the name of the king, who
                    reserved a fifth of the profits. It was also stipulated that the vessels should
                    return to Bristol, and that the privilege of exclusive resort and traffic
                    belonged to the patentees.</p>
                <p part="N">Although the patent was conferred on John Cabot and his three sons,
                    there can be no doubt, even if the father did accompany the expedition, that its
                    success was entirely owing to the genius of Sebastian. The inaccuracies which
                    have arisen from the loose investigation and immature consideration of several
                    ancient and modern writers, are now satisfactorily traced to certain perverted
                    statements of Hakluyts; and their exposition, which we owe to the industry and
                    acumen of the author of the Memoir alluded to, is worthy of attentive
                    examination. Suffice it here to remark, that from a singular misinterpretation
                    of some documents, and the omission of others, John Cabot, who was not the
                    discoverer, but only a part owner of an expedition to discover new lands,
                    erroneously got the credit, not only of his son Sebastian’s discovery of the
                    American continent, but also of possessing powers of mind and scientific
                    knowledge which were scarcely inferior to those possessed by Columbus
                    himself.</p>
                <p part="N">To Sebastian Cabot, therefore, belongs the undoubted glory of the first
                    discovery of the <hi rend="italic">terra</hi><hi rend="italic">firma</hi> of the
                    Western World. The expedition, consisting of the ship commanded by Sebastian,
                    and three or four smaller vessels, sailed from Bristol in the beginning of May
                    1497; and an ancient Bristol manuscript records the fact, that, “in the year
                    1497, the 24th June, on St John’s day, was Newfoundland found, by Bristol men,
                    in a ship called the Mathew.” On the authority of Peter Martyr, wc learn, that
                    after quitting the north, where he reached latitude sixtyseven and a half, Cabot
                    proceeded along the coast of the continent, to a latitude corresponding probably
                    with that of the Straits of Gibraltar. Indeed he is said to have gone so far
                    southward, “ut Cubam Insulam a laeva longitudine graduum pene parem habuerit.” A
                    failure of provisions at this point compelled him to desist from further
                    pursuit, and the expedition returned to England.</p>
                <p part="N">The second patent, which for the first time has been published in the
                    Memoir referred to, is dated 3d February 1498, and gives authority to “John
                    Kabotto or his deputies,” to take at pleasure six English ships, and “them,
                    convey and lede to the londe and isles of late ound.” Shortly after the date of
                    this patent John Cabot died; and it is said that his sons Lewis and Saucius went
                    to settle in Italy. Sebastian, however, did not abandon an enterprise in which
                    he had embarked; and a second voyage was zealously undertaken under his
                    superintendence. A ship equipped at the king’s expense, along with four small
                    vessels, sailed from Bristol in the spring of the year 1498. It is curious, that
                    although, both from the language of the patent, and the circumstance of three
                    hundred men embarking, colonization seems to have been contemplated, the leading
                    object of the voyage was to effect the discovery of a north-west passage. The
                    result is unfortunately wrapt in much obscurity. Gomara alone furnishes us with
                    what may be a correct account. According to this author, Cabot “directed his
                    course by the tracte of islande, uppon the Cape of Labrador, at lviii. degrees;
                    affirmynge that, in the monethe of July, there was such could, and heapes of
                    ise, that he durst passe no further; also, that the dayes were very longe, and
                    in maner without nyght, and the nyghtes very clear. Certayne it is, that at the
                    lx. degrees, the longest day is of xviii. houres. But consyderynge the coulde,
                    and the straungeness of the unknowen lande, he turned his course from thense to
                    the west, folowynge the coast of the lande of Baccalaos unto the xxxviii.
                    degrees, from whense he returned to Eng-lande.” (Eden’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Decades,</hi> fol. 318.)</p>
                <p part="N">The results of this second voyage were not sufficiently important to
                    induce Henry to equip another expedition. We have good authority for believing,
                    however, that Cabot, in 1499, “with no extraordinary preparations sett forth
                    from Bristoll, and made greate discoveries.” (Seyer’s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs
                        of Bristol.')</hi> This is confirmed by the navigator Hojeda having, in his
                    first voyage, found “certain Englishmen” in the neighbourhood of Caquibacoa. It
                    is highly probable, from the unlikelihood of any other English seamen pursuing
                    such a route, that these were Cabot and his Companions. But the narrative of
                    Cabot’s life for the fifteen years subsequent to the departure of his second
                    expedition is meagre and unsatisfactory. One circumstance deserves notice, that
                    during that period Amerigo Vespucci, in company with Hojeda, crossed the
                    Atlantic for the <hi rend="italic">first time,</hi> whilst Sebastian was
                    prosecuting his third voyage; yet, as the author of his memoirs says, “while the
                    name of the one overspreads the new world, no bay, cape, or headland, recals the
                    memory of the other.”</p>
                <p part="N">After the death of Henry VH., upon the invitation of Ferdinand,
                    Sebastian Cabot went to Spain; and Vespucci, who held the office of pilot-major,
                    having died, he was appointed his successor. He was soon employed in a general
                    revision of maps and charts; and his public and private character endeared him
                    to most of the learned and good men in Spain. He had, however, like Columbus,
                    many enemies; and the death of Ferdinand put an end to an expedition then in
                    contemplation. The ignoble commencement of the reign of Charles V. frustrated
                    all further hopes of its prosecution; and Cabot in disgust returned to England,
                    where, under Henry VIII. he got honourable employment, and performed another
                    westwardly voyage in 1517, which, however, from various causes, proved
                    unsuccessful.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1518 we find our navigator in Spain, and again reinstated in the
                    appointment of pilot-major. The dispute between Spain and Portugal in regard to
                    their respective rights to the Moluccas having been decided at the congress of
                    Badajos in 1524 in favour of Spain, a company was formed at Seville to open a
                    commercial intercourse with these islands; and Cabot, with the title of
                    Captaingeneral, set sail, after many delays, with a fleet in April 1526. The
                    squadron was ill assorted, and a mutiny broke out, the consequences of which
                    diverted lιis course from the Moluccas to the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, up
                    which he penetrated about three hundred and fifty leagues. He erected a fort at
                    St Salvador; and afterwards sailing up <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193743035?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3035-0767"/>the Parana,
                    he built other two forts. He subsequently entered the Paraguay, where he was
                    drawn into a sanguinary contest with the natives. From the report then made by
                    him to Charles V. it is probable, had he been supplied with means and
                    ammunition, he would have made the conquest of Peru, which Pizarro afterwards
                    accomplished with his own private resources. After tarrying in the hopes of
                    receiving supplies, Cabot was forced to return to Spain, where he resumed his
                    functions of pilot-major.</p>
                <p part="N">He finally settled in England, where he appears to have exercised a
                    general supervision over the maritime concerns of the country, and enjoyed a
                    pension of two hundred and fifty merks. It was then that he disclosed to Edward
                    VI. his discovery of the phenomenon of the variation of the needle ;—a discovery
                    for which alone his name deserves to be immortalized. It was also at his
                    instigation that tho important expedition was undertaken which resulted in the
                    opening of the trade with Russia; and in the charter of the company of merchant
                    adventurers he was nominated governor for life, as “the chiefest setter forth”
                    of the enterprise. Cabot lived to a very advanced age, and died probably in
                    London; but neither the date of his death nor the place of his interment is
                    properly authenticated.</p>
                <p part="N">Sebastian Cabot may be justly regarded as one of the most illustrious
                    navigators the world has ever seen. His life exhibits one continued devotion to
                    the mighty impulses of his genius. England owes him a debt of imperishable
                    gratitude. “He ended,” says the author <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Memoir
                    which has rescued so much of his life from obscurity, “he ended, as he had
                    begun, his career in the service of his native country, infusing into her marine
                    a spirit of lofty enterprise, a high moral tone, a system of mild but inflexible
                    discipline, of which the results were not long after so conspicuously displayed.
                    Finally, he is seen to open new sources of commerce, of which the influence may
                    be distinctly traced on her present greatness and prosperity.” (z. z.)</p>
