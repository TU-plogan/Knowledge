                        rend="smallcaps">Liqueo,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Lieoukiou.</hi> This
                    group of islands is situated in the Eastern Ocean, to the south of Japan, about
                    400 or 500 miles east of the Chinese coast. They were little known to Europeans
                    until they were visited by Captains Maxwell and Hall in the Alceste and Lyra in
                    1816, on their return from conveying Lord Amherst to China. Very full accounts
                    have been published by Captain Hall and M$ Macleod of these islands, and of the
                    climate and soil, as well as of the inhabitants, who appeared to these gentlemen
                    to be extremely simple and interesting in their manners. These islands are in
                    number thirty-six; but the only one of any great extent is the</p>
                <p part="N">Great Loo-choo, which is thirty miles in length, and from twelve to
                    fifteen in breadth. The climate is here a happy medium between the opposite
                    extremes of heat and cold. Being situated in the middle of a vast ocean, these
                    islands are refreshed by the sea breezes, which, blowing continually over them,
                    produce an agreeable coolness. They are also well watered by small rivers and
                    streamlets, which, rising in the central eminences, flow in different directions
                    to the sea, and afford an abundant supply of excellent water. Being in the
                    latitude of 26. N., the scenery, though not quite so rich, is, according to
                    Captain Hall, even more pleasing to the eye than in countries nearer to the
                    equator; the vegetation not being so luxuriant as to overload the landscape with
                    foliage. The style of the landscape is on the whole decidedly tropical, though
                    there is much variety; and the groves of pine trees 'give some parts of the
                    country quite a European character. The orange and lime, the banyan of India,
                    and the Norwegian fir, all thrive in Loo-choo. The mode of dressing the ground
                    at Loo-choo is very neat, and resembles that of China, particularly in the
                    process of manuring and irrigation. Tobacco, wheat, rice, Indian corn, millet,
                    sweet potatoes, brinjals, and many other tropical vegetables, grow in great
                    perfection at Loo-choo. Along the sides of the hills, and around the villages,
                    the bamboo and rattan grow to a considerable size. But Captain Hall mentions
                    that the pine was the most conspicuous tree which they observed on the island,
                    rising to a great height and size. Some are forty feet in height, and three or
                    four in girth. The cattle on this island are of a small black breed, and
                    invariably used instead of horses for agricultural purposes. Hogs, goats, and
                    poultry, with rice and a great variety of vegetables, form the chief food of the
                    inhabitants, milk being seldom used. The English saw no geese on the island, nor
                    sheep; but their horses, though very small and slender, were sufficiently strong
                    for the natives. Their goats and pigs were also diminutive; but the poultry were
                    large and excellent. These islands are not infested by any wild animals. They
                    had no carts or wheeled carriages of any kind, all loads being carried by
                    horses; and the roads, which are numerous, and generally kept in excellent
                    order, measure generally from six to ten feet across.</p>
                <p part="N">The whole coast of Loo-choo, as well as of the other islands, is
                    encircled with coral reefs, which do not appear above water; and when the
                    weather is calm, and their situation is not pointed out by breakers, they are
                    exceedingly dangerous to mariners. The Alceste, Captain Maxwell’s ship, was
                    several times in danger from these hidden rocks. This singular formation, which
                    appears to be extending itself over the Pacific, was minutely examined by
                    Captain Hall. After the sea has left it for some time, it becomes dry, and
                    appears to be a compact rock; but no sooner does the tide rise again, and the
                    waves begin to wash over it, than millions of coral worms, protruding themselves
                    from holes in the surface, begin their operations; so that, from their
                    prodigious numbers, the whole surface of the rock appears to be alive and in
                    motion. These insects or worms cannot raise the rock above the surface of the
                    water, and the level of the highest tide is accordingly the limit of the rock
                    upwards, after which a horizontal field comes to be formed coincident with that
                    plane, and perpendicular on all sides; and thus the reef, extending itself
                    perpendicularly, and in all directions, becomes extremely dangerous to
                    navigators. On the coast of Loo-choo there are several excellent harbours,
                    particularly one, which is capacious and safe, and affords everywhere depth of
                    water for the largest ships, with secure anchorage. Its banks consist of high
                    rocks, overgrown with climbing plants and flowers.</p>
                <p part="N">These islands are inhabited by a singular and apparently amiable people.
                    They are of a diminutive stature, <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193208781?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8781-0566"/>not
                    exceeding in their average height above five feet two inches. But they are
                    strong, well-made, and athletic; and in complexion they are quite as fair as the
                    natives of Spain and Portugal. They invariably manifested towards their English
                    visitors the most gentle, polite, and humane dispositions, but with that
                    jealousy of them as strangers which is peculiar to China, Japan, and all the
                    neighbouring countries. They were at first extremely averse to the landing of
                    their visitors, and it was only after long deliberations that they were induced
                    to concede the liberty of doing §o. But our people were confined to a small
                    space on the sea-shore, under a burning sun; and it was only by renewed
                    entreaties that they were allowed to extend their walks into the country.
                    The’natives, however, very freely visited the English ships, and examined them
                    carefully in all their equipmentsand detail. They accepted readily the
                    hospitality of the strangers, and conformed to their manners in every thing. In
                    their interviews they always showed a natural good breeding, bowing whenever
                    they spoke to the English, uncovering their heads in their presence, and, in
                    drinking, bowing to all around. After they had permitted the English to land,
                    many visits were paid; but they never admitted the strangers into the interior
                    of their town, and even limited their walks within a certain space. Any attempt
                    to pass these bounds was always resisted by the sentinels; not, however, by
                    force, but by a polite request, and by representing, that if the orders of the
                    court were transgressed, blame would fall upon them. Some overtures were made by
                    Captain Maxwell for an interview with the king; but these were always steadily
                    resisted, on the ground or pretence that no embassy or letters were brought from
                    the king of Eng-Iand, to whom, however, the king of Loo-choo wrote a letter,
                    which was unfortunately lost in the wreck of the Alceste. It was extremely
                    difficult to bring about any intercourse with this people. Ordinary requests
                    were made the subject of tedious négociations; and the most ungracious feature
                    in their character was their uniform aversion to any intimate communication with
                    their visitors. In one particular they manifested a rigid adherence to Chinese
                    manners; namely, in carefully withholding from the view of the Europeans their
                    women, though the latter did not appear otherwise to be very closely confined.
                    The practice of polygamy, which prevails in China, has no place here, and, the
                    English were told, was even held in abhorrence. From the free intercourse also
                    of the different sexes, the parties had opportunities of being acquainted before
                    marriage.</p>
                <p part="N">One of the most remarkable facts mentioned by Captain Hall is, that the
                    natives of these islands were unacquainted with the use of fire-arms. From all
                    that the English could observe, they were even ignorant of the use of money; and
                    though those amongst the natives who had visited China must have seen the
                    currency of that country, yet none of them showed any desire to possess Spanish
                    dollars or gold coins, nor could it ever be learned whether they were in
                    possession of any common medium of exchange. With regard to their want of arms,
                    it is supposed by Mr Macleod, that the Chinese, after conquering, had disarmed
                    them. The musketry and cannon of the English were objects of great wonder to
                    them; and when they saw Captain Maxwell bring down a bird on the wing, they were
                    shocked and terrified, and requested that fire-arms should not be again brought
                    into the island. When Napoleon was informed, at St Helena, that these people had
                    neither arms nor money, he ridiculed the idea as incredible and absurd, and
                    affirmed that the English had been imposed on. The result justified his
                    penetration. These people are well acquainted with both; and it is now known
                    that, notwithstanding all their fair seeming, they are about the most
                    remorseless pirates in the Yellow Sea. In their intercourse with our people,
                    however, they were remarked for their honesty; insomuch, that though they were
                    freely admitted on board of the English ships, and many valuable articles were
                    often in their way, yet nothing was ever missed.</p>
                <p part="N">They appear to live on social and friendly terms with one another, and
                    have frequently pic-nic parties in the fields, the dinner being carried about in
                    little japanned boxes, with sliding drawers, fastened to the end of a bamboo.
                    They entertained the English at dinner; and the meal consisted of hard-boiled
                    eggs coloured and sliced, fish dried in butter, sliced junk smoked, sliced pig’s
                    liver; then came tea, which was succeeded by an unpalatable dish of coarse,
                    soft, black sugar, wrapped up in unbaked dough. Cakes in various shapes, with
                    something like cheese, completed the entertainment; the intervals being filled
                    up with drinking sackee, and with smoking.</p>
                <p part="N">The Loo∙chooans appear to have made no progress in science or
                    literature, though several individuals amongst them were distinguished by the
                    English for their intelligence, and turn for inquiry. Their language is a
                    dialect of the Japanese; but they have Chinese books, which are studied by the
                    learned. Their religion seems to resemble the superstition of China; but it is
                    remarkable that the order of priests, who are generally objects of veneration in
                    all countries, are here considered as an inferior caste. All the science of
                    these islanders is derived from the Chinese. Their practice of medicine is also
                    Chinese; and they generally*administer to their patients roots, seeds, and dried
                    flowers of the country. The capital of Great Loo-choo, and of the archipelago,
                    is situated five miles from its port of Napakiang. The English were not allowed
                    to approach it, but saw it from a distance, beautifully situated on the top of a
                    hill; the houses, intermingled with the trees, rising above one another, and the
                    royal palace above the whole. When the English left these islands, the natives
                    professed the most affectionate regard for them, and expressed (with what
                    sincerity the reader may judge) the deepest regret at their departure. Long, of
                    the capital of the Great Loo-choo, 127. 52. 1. E. Lat. 26. 14. N.</p>
