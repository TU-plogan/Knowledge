                <p part="N"><label type="entry">LYCURGUS</label>, the celebrated legislator of the
                    Spartans, was the son of Eunomes, king of Sparta. He travelled in Greece, the
                    island of Crete, Egypt, and even proceeded to the Indies, to converse with the
                    sages and learned men of those countries, and to learn their manners, customs,
                    and laws. After the death of his brother Polydectes, who was king of Sparta, his
                    widow offered the crown to Lycurgus, promising that she would cause herself to
                    miscarry of the child of which she was pregnant, provided he would marry her;
                    but Lycurgus nobly refused these advantageous offers, and afterwards contented
                    himself with being tutor to his nephew Charillus, whom he restored to the
                    government when he came of age. Notwithstanding this honourable and generous
                    conduct, however, he was accused of a design to usurp the crown. This calumny
                    obliged him to retire to the island of Crete, where he applied himself to the
                    study of the laws and customs of nations. On his return to Lacedaemon, he
                    reformed the government, and, to prevent the disorders occasioned by luxury and
                    the love of riches, he prohibited the use of gold and silver; placed all the
                    citizens in a state of equality; and introduced the strictest temperance, the
                    most exact discipline, and those remarkable laws which, with few exceptions,
                    have been celebrated by all historians. It is said, that, to engage the
                    Lacedaemonians to observe them inviolably, he made them promise upon oath not to
                    change any part of them till his return; and that he afterwards went to the
                    island of Crete, where he killed himself, having ordered that his ashes should
                    be thrown into the sea, from fear lest, if his body should be carried to Sparta,
                    the Lacedaemonians would think themselves absolved from their oath. He
                    flourished about 870 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Lycürgus,</hi> one of the most celebrated orators
                    of Greece, was born at Athens about the year <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>
                    400, and died about B. c. 323. He was son of Lycophron, and grandson of
                    Lycurgus, one or other of whom was put to death by the Thirty Tyrants, <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 404 (Phot. <hi rend="italic">Cod.</hi> cclxviii.
                    p. 1483). In his early years he studied philosophy under Plato, and the
                    political constitution of his country under Isocrates. At what period he entered
                    upon public life is nowhere recorded, but we find him, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.
                        c.</hi> 343, appointed, along with Demosthenes, one of the ambassadors to
                    counteract the proceedings of Philip in different parts of Greece (Demosth. <hi
                        rend="italic">Philipp,</hi> iii. p. 129). So much confidence had his
                    fellow-citizens in his integrity, that he continued to preside over the
                    collection of the public revenue for twelve or fifteen years. After the defeat
                    of the Greeks at the battle of Chaeronea, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c. 338,
                    he brought Lysicles, the general of the Athenians on that occasion, to trial
                    before the people, and procured his condemnation (Diodor. Sicul. xvi. 88). He
                    restored the credit of comic exhibitions at the Lenaean festival, and enacted
                    honours for the three great tragic poets <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Vit.</hi> X. Or. p. 841). Lycurgus was one of the orators
                    demanded by Alexander, after the destruction of Thebes, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b.</hi> e. 335; but the Athenians refused to give him up (Plut. <hi
                        rend="italic">Demosth. c.</hi> 23; Arrian, <hi rend="italic">Exp.</hi> i.
                    10). It would appear that Lycurgus died about the time of the exile of
                    Demosthenes, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c. 323, the year before that orator’s
                    death (<hi rend="italic">Vit.</hi> x. Or. p. 842). There were fifteen orations
                    of Lycurgus extant in the time of Plutarch and Photius, but only one has been
                    preserved (against Leocrates), which was delivered <hi rend="smallcaps">b.
                        c.</hi> 330. It is published by Hauptmann (Lips. 1751), by Schulze (Bruns.
                    1789), by Osann (Jena, 1821), and, along with other fragments, by Bekker
                    (Magdeb. 1821).</p>
