                    or fewer geometrical paces, according to the different usages and customs of
                    countries. A league at sea contains 3000 geometrical paces, or three English
                    miles. The French league sometimes contains the same measure, and sometimes
                    consists of 3500 paces; the mean or common league consists of 2400 paces, and
                    the little league of 2000. The Spanish leagues are larger than the French;
                    seventeen Spanish leagues making a degree, or twenty French leagues, or
                    sixty-nine and a half English statute miles. The Dutch and German leagues
                    contain each four geographical miles. The Persian leagues are pretty nearly of
                    the same extent with the Spanish; that is, they are equal to four Italian miles,
                    which is pretty near what Herodotus calls the length of the Persian parasang,
                    which contained thirty stadia, eight of which, according to Strabo, were equal
                    to a mile. The word comes from <hi rend="italic">leuca</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >leuga,</hi> an ancient Gaulish word for an itinerary measure, and retained
                    in that sense by the Romans. Some derive the word <hi rend="italic">leuca</hi>
                    from λεuxoς, <hi rend="italic">ιvhite,</hi> as the Gauls, in imitation of the
                    Romans, marked the spaces and distances of their roads with white stones.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">League</hi> also denotes an alliance or confederacy
                    between princes and states for their mutual aid, either in attacking some common
                    enemy, or in defending themselves against one. The word comes from <hi
                        rend="italic">liga,</hi> which, in the corrupt Latin, was used for a
                    confederacy: <hi rend="italic">Qua quis cum alio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >ligatur.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Leagues, amongst the Greeks, were of three sorts: 1. ∑woι⅜,
                    ∑u&gt;3&gt;jκ&gt;j, or <hi rend="italic">E</hi> ∣ <hi rend="italic">ξηvη,</hi>
                    by which both parties were obliged to cease from hostilities, without molesting
                    the allies of each other; 2. <hi rend="italic">Emμaχ</hi><hi rend="italic
                        subscript"> ι</hi><hi rend="italic">∕a,</hi> by which they engaged to lend
                    assistance to each other in case of invasion; and, 3. <hi rend="italic"
                        >2vμμaχ∕a,</hi> by which they engaged to have the same friends and enemies,
                    and to assist each other upon all occasions. All these leagues were confirmed
                    with oaths, and imprecations, and sacrifices. The victims most generally
                    sacrificed were a boar, ram, or goat, sometimes all the three; and sometimes
                    bulls and lambs. They cut out the testicles of the animal, and stood upon them
                    whilst they swore; then some of the hair of the victim was distributed to all
                    present; and, lastly, they cut the animal’s throat, which was called ocκ∕α <hi
                        rend="italic">ημmv,</hi> in Latin, <hi rend="italic">ferire</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">foedus.</hi> This being done, they repeated their oaths and
                    imprecations, calling the gods to witness the honesty of their intentions. A
                    libation was then made of wine, which was mixed, to imply their conjunction and
                    union; and whilst this was pouring out, they prayed that the blood of him who
                    should break the treaty might be poured out in like manner. Upon these occasions
                    no part of the victim was eaten. Still further to increase the solemnity of this
                    obligation, the league was engraved upon brass, fixed up in places of public
                    resort, and sometimes read at the solemn games. Some exchanged certain <hi
                        rend="italic">cυμβο</hi> ∖ <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >tesseroe,</hi> upon the occasion, and frequently sent ambassadors on an
                    appointed day, to keep each other in mind of their engagements.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> League,</hi>
                    byway of eminence, denotes that famous one which existed in France from the year
                    1576 to 1593. Its intention was to prevent the succession to the crown of Henry
                    IV. who was of the reformed religion; and it ended with his abjuration of that
                    faith.</p>
                <p part="N">The Leaguers, or confederates, were of three kinds. The <hi
                        rend="italic">zealous leaguers</hi> aimed at the utter destruction, not only
                    of the Huguenots, but also of the ministry. The <hi rend="italic">Spanish
                        leaguers</hi> had principally in view the transferring of the crown of
                    France to the king of Spain, or the infanta his daughter. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >moderate leaguers</hi> aimed only at the extirpation of Calvinism, without
                    any alteration of the government.</p>
