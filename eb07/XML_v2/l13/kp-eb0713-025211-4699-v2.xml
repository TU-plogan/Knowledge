                    eminent Italian writer, was descended of a family which once made a considerable
                    figure at Bologna. Jerom, his father, was page to Prince Charles de’ Medicis;
                    served some time in the troops of the grand duke as captain of foot; and married
                    at Milan, where lie settled in 1628. He was afterwards governor of Almantea in
                    Calabria, and died at Salerno in the year 1639. Gregorio was born at Milan in
                    1630, studied under the Jesuits at Cosenza, and was afterwards sent to Rome by
                    an uncle, who wished him to enter the church; but he being averse to this,
                    proceeded to Geneva, where he studied the principles of religion and government.
                    Thence he went to Lausanne; and having contracted an acquaintance with John
                    Anthony Guérin, an eminent physician, lodged at his house, made profession of
                    the Calvinist religion, and married his daughter. He settled at Geneva, where he
                    spent nearly twenty years, carrying on a correspondence with learned men,
                    especially with those of Italy. Some contests obliged him to leave that city in
                    1679; upon which he went to France, and then to England, where he was received
                    with great civility by Charles II. who, after his first audience, made him a
                    present of a thousand crowns, and promised him the place of historiographer.
                    Whilst in England, he wrote a history of that country; but as this work
                    displeased the court, on account of his too great liberty in writing, he was
