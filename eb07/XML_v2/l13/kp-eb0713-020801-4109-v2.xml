                <p part="N"><label type="entry">LEICESTER</label>, a town, the capital of the county
                    of the same name, ninety-eight miles north of London. It is situated on the
                    river Soar; but, by means chiefly of canals, has the means of conveyance to
                    every part of the kingdom. It is an ancient town, said to have been built by
                    King Lear, and was a place of strength when England was invaded by the Romans.
                    It appears by Doomsday Book, that at the Norman conquest, it was a city, and
                    populous. In the reign of Henry V. a parliament was held here. Richard HL, after
                    his defeat and death, was buried in a Franciscan convent, which then stood near
                    St Martin’s Church. The town was formerly fortified, and the remains of the wall
                    may now be in many parts distinctly traced. The castle was a most extensive
                    building; and though a great part of the ground upon which it stood is now
                    covered with good dwelling-houses, other parts are entire, and a portion is
                    appropriately made of use for courts of justice at the county assizes. Leicester
                    is divided into six parishes, and the castle, which is extra-parochial. It
                    contains six churches, and twenty-one chapels for dissenters of the different
                    denominations. It is a corporate town; and its government, under the provisions
                    of the municipal corporation act, consists of a mayor, recorder, high bailiff,
                    forty-two councilmen, fourteen aldermen, ten magistrates, town-clerk, and other
                    officers, with an efficient police. It sends, as before, two members to the
                    House of Commons. The chief employment of Leicester is the manufacture of
                    hosiery goods, long consisting of worsted and thread stockings, to which
                    afterwards cotton hose were added, and of late years hose of silk. But within a
                    very few years a large quantity of gloves of cotton have been made. The lace
                    trade is also carried on to a very considerable extent. The smaller branches of
                    trade, such as braces, cravats, tapes, children’s fancy worsted boots and shoes,
                    and other articles, are all in the most prosperous condition. The winding and
                    sewing of cotton has also been carried on for several years, and is now arrived
                    at the highest state of perfection. This part of the trade gi√es employment to
                    vast numbers of young females, who are amply paid by their employers.</p>

                <p part="N">The price of coals has been very much reduced of late years, in
                    consequence of a new railway, constructed about four years ago, by which coals
                    are conveyed from the northern part of the county. This has caused an active
                    competition between the Leicestershire and Derbyshire coal-owners; and the
                    reduction in the price of fuel has induced the manufacturers to erect
                    steam-engines, which are employed in combing wool, spinning worsted, and other
                    branches of trade. There are few towns in which are to be seen so very many
                    charitable institutions for the relief of poverty, age, sickness, and general
                    distress, and for the gratuitous instruction of the inferior classes. The
                    country around is highly fertile, and the markets, held on Wednesday and
                    Saturday, are amply and cheaply supplied. The population has rapidly increased,
                    amounting in 1801 to 16,953, in 1811 to 23,146, in 1821 to 30,125, in 1831 to
                    39,306, and being at the present time (1836) not fewer than 44,000. The town has
                    been greatly improved by the removal of old houses, and the erection of new
                    ones. Several public buildings are in progress, viz. a new county lunatic
                    asylum, and a reading and news-room, to be supported by subscriptions; a new
                    theatre, and two new schools.</p>
