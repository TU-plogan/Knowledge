                        van Leyden,</hi> was born at Leyden in 1494. He received his first
                    instructions in the art of painting from his father Hugues Jacobs, but completed
                    his studies in the school of Cornelius Engelbrecht. He gained much money by his
                    profession; and being of a generous turn of mind, he spent it freely, dressed
                    well, and lived in a superior style. It is said that a few years before his
                    death he made a tour in Zealand and Brabant; and that, during his journey, a
                    painter of Flushing, envious of his great abilities, gave him poison at an
                    entertainment, which, though very slow in its operation, proved fatal in its
                    effect, and put an end to his life, after languishing six years under its cruel
                    influence. Others deny the story of the poison, and attribute his death to his
                    incessant industry. The superiority of this artist’s genius manifested itself in
                    his infancy; for <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209041?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-9041-0586"/> his works, even from the age of nine, were so
                    excellent, as to excite the admiration of all contemporary artists; and when he
                    was about fifteen, he painted a St Hubert which gained him great applause. His
                    tone of colouring is good; his attitudes, making allowance for the stiff German
                    taste, are well chosen; his figures have considerable expression in their faces,
                    and his pictures are very highly finished. In the town-hall at Leyden, the most
                    capital picture of Lucas, the subject of which is the Last Judgment, has been
                    preserved with great care; the magistrates having refused very large sums which
                    have been offered for it. This artist painted not only in oil, but also in
                    distemper and upon glass. Nor was he less eminent for his engraving than for his
                    painting. He carried on a familiar and friendly correspondence with Albert
                    Durer, who was his contemporary; and it is said, that as regularly as Albert
                    Durer published one print, Lucas published another, without the least jealousy
                    on either side, or any wish to depreciate each other’s merit. His style of
                    engraving, however, according to Mr Strutt, differed considerably from that of
                    Albert Durer, and seems evidently to have been founded upon the works of Israel
                    van Mech-len. His prints are very neat and clear, but without any powerful
                    effect. The strokes are as fine and delicate upon the objects in the front as
                    upon those in the distancés; and this want of variety, joined with the
                    feebleness of the masses of shadow, give to his engravings, with all their
                    neatness, an unfinished appearance, much unlike the firm substantial effects
                    which we find in the works of Albert Durer. He was very attentive to the
                    minutiae of his art. Every thing is carefully made out in his prints, and no
                    part of them is neglected. He gave great character and expression to the heads
                    of his figures; but on examination of his works we find the same heads too often
                    repeated. He engraved upon wood as well as upon copper, but his works on the
                    former are by no means numerous. They are, however, very spirited, though, upon
                    the whole, not equal to those of his friend Albert. The prints of this master
                    are pretty numerous, but very seldom met with complete, especially fine
                    impressions of them; for though they are, generally speaking, executed with the
                    graver only, yet, from the delicacy of the execution, they soon suffered in the
                    printing.</p>

                    learned English divine, was born in 1648, and studied at Oxford, after which he
                    entered into holy orders, and was for some time master of the free school at
                    Abergavenny. Being esteemed an excellent preacher, he became vicar of St
                    Stephen’s, Coleman Street, London, and lecturer of St Olave’s, in Southwark. He
                    was created doctor of divinity, and in 1696 installed prebendary of Westminster.
                    His sight began to fail in his youth, and he totally lost it in his more
                    advanced age. He was greatly esteemed for his piety and learning, and published
                    several works, particularly, 1. Practical Christianity; 2. An Inquiry after
                    Happiness; 3. Several sermons; and, 4. A Latin translation of the Whole Duty of
                    Man. He died in 1715.</p>
