                    in Staffordshire, situated upon a branch of the river Trent, 119 miles from
                    London by Coventry, and 124 by Northampton. It has been an episcopal city almost
                    from the introduction of Christianity into this island; anď the cathedral is
                    said to have been first built in the year 300. It is a fine building, walled in
                    like a castle, and, from its elevated situation, a prominent object over a great
                    extent of country. A spire rises from the centre, 256 feet in height; and at the
                    west end are two towers, terminating also in spires. This city was for a short
                    period in the eighth century made the see of an archbishop; but was soon
                    afterwards reduced again to a bishopric. In the year 1072, it was removed to
                    Chester, and in 1102 to Coventry, and united to that see. The cathedral is a
                    fine piece of architecture, and the interior is adorned with some marble
                    monuments, particularly those of Dr Johnson and Mr Garrick, both natives of the
                    city. The government is executed by a corporation consisting of two bailiffs and
                    twenty-four burgesses, and sends, as before the passing of the reform act, two
                    members to parliament. It is a county, with exempt jurisdiction. There is little
                    trade, except what is internally carried on upon the canals. It has markets on
                    Tuesdays and Fridays. The population amounted in 1801 to 4712, in 1811 to 5022,
                    in 1821 to 6075, and in 1831 to 6723.</p>

                    pursuits. The population amounted in 1830 to 42,855.</p>
