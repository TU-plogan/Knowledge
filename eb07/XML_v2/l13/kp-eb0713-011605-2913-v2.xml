                        >Constantine</hi></label>, one of those illustrious Greeks who, having been
                    expelled from their native country in the fifteenth century, contributed greatly
                    to the revival of letters in Europe. He was descended of the imperial family of
                    the same name, and born at Constantinople, though in what year has not been
                    ascertained. In 1454, he left the imperial city, destined soon afterwards to
                    become the prey of the Turkish invaders, and went to seek an asylum in Italy,
                    where he was favourably received by Francisco Sforza, who intrusted him with the
                    education of his daughter Hippolyta, afterwards married to Alfonzo king of
                    Naples. From Milan he proceeded to Rome, where he lived some time in habits of
                    intimacy with Cardinal Bessarion, and then set out for Naples, whither he had
                    been invited by King Ferdinand, in order to profess Greek and rhetoric in that
                    city. Having spent some years in this occupation, he formed the resolution of
                    going to end his days in one of the isles of Greece; but the vessel in which he
                    had embarked having touched at Messina, the principal inhabitants made to him
                    such urgent applications, that he consented to give lessons in their city. The
                    reputation of this great master of learning soon attracted thither numerous
                    pupils, amongst whom the celebrated Bembo is said to have been one; and he
                    received the honour of citizenship, which he merited equally by his virtues and
                    his erudition. He lived to an advanced age, and died towards the end of the year
                    1493. In gratitude for the proofs of regard which he had received from the
                    senate, he bequeathed to it, by his will, his library, consisting of valuable
                    manuseripts, which were afterwards transported to Spain, where they may still be
                    seen in the Royal Library of the Escurial. His published works are, 1.

                        rend="italic">Andrew John,</hi> a learned Greek, of the same family with the
                    preceding, and surnamed <hi rend="italic">Phyndacenus,</hi> probably because he
                    was originally from Rhyndacus, a small town between the Hellespont and Phrygia.
                    He abandoned his native country after the overthrow of the lower empire, and
                    took refuge at the court of Lorenzo de’ Medicis. This great protector of letters
                    sent him back to the East to collect such manuscripts as had escaped the fury of
                    the Turks; and having obtained permission to examine the libraries, he derived
                    from them a great number of valuable works. Some years afterwards, he made a
                    second voyage to Greece; but before his return Lorenzo died, and the’ troubles
                    which broke out in Florence determined Lascaris to accept the offers made to him
                        <hi rend="subscript"> tι</hi> by Charles VIII. in order to draw him to
                    France. He was at Paris in the year 1495; and it was he who taught the
                    principles of the Greek language to Budé and to Danes. In 1503, Louis XII.
                    appointed him to the embassy of Venice; a mission in which he must have
                    acquitted himself in a satisfactory manner, since he was sent thither a second
                    time in 1505. Nevertheless, Wicquefort pretends that Lascaris was but ill
                    qualified for an employment which required a knowledge of the interests of
                    princes, and great experience of the world; and he even asserts that the
                    Venetians complained that France had sent them a pedant instead of an
                    ambassador. His functions ceased in consequence of the rupture which took place
                    between the republic and France; and Lascaris resumed the teaching of the Greek
                    language. Leo X. having conceived the design of extending the knowledge of this
                    language, called him to Rome, to put him at the head of the college of young
                    Greeks which he had just founded; and at the same time confided to him the
                    direction of a printing establishment destined to multiply impressions of Greek
                    books. In 1515, the pope intrusted him with a mission to Francis I.; and this
                    prince, sensible of his merits, endeavoured to retain him in France. Lascaris,
                    however, returned to Rome the same year; but he revisited Paris in 1518, and,
                    along with Budé, was employed to form the royal library of Fontainebleau.
                    Francis I. then appointed Lascaris his ambassador to Venice, as his predecessor
                    had. done; and he remained in that city until Pope Paul III. testified a desire
                    to have him at Rome. He yielded to the solicitations of the pontiff, though
                    suffering from the gout, and immediately set out for the capital of the
                    Christian world; but the fatigue of the journey augmented his sufferings, and he
                    died, in 1535, a few months after his arrival, at the advanced age of nearly
                    ninety. Lascaris did not deem it unworthy of him to act as corrector of the
                    press, first in the office of F. Alopa at Florence, and next in the
                    printing-housc established by Pope Leo X. in Monte-Cavallo; and we are indebted
                    to him for excellent editions of the following works, viz. I. Anthologia
                    Epigrammatum Graecorum, libri vii. Graece, Florence, 1494, in 4to; 2. Callimachi
                    Hymni Gr. cum scholiis Graecis, ibid, in 4to, the <hi rend="italic">editio
                        princeps,</hi> executed with the same characters as the preceding work; 3.
                    Scholia Graeca in Iliadem, in integrum restituta, Rome, 1517, in folio, a very
                    rare edition; 4. Homericarum Quaestionum, liber, et de Nympharum antro in
                    Odyssea opusculum, ibid. 1518, in small 4to, the <hi rend="italic">editio

                    Tragoedias Sophoclis, ibid. 1518, in small 4to. Lascaris wrote in Latin with
                    equal facility and elegance; and he was entreated to undertake the translation
                    of several Greek authors, but he has only rendered some treatises of Polybius on
                    the military art. Several smaller works are also ascribed to him, viz. 1.
