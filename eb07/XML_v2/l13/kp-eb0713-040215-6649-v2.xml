                    that part of the republic of Colombia which formerly constituted the viceroyalty
                    of New Granada, being bounded on the north by Meridas and Varinas, on the east
                    by Varinas, on the south by Quixos, and on the west by Bogota. Its limits are
                    somewhat vague, the name signifying province of the plains, which extend their
                    dreary surfaces from 200 to 300 leagues in length, and about the same in
                    breadth. It is watered by many large rivers, the principal being the Rio Meta,
                    the Casanare, the Vichada, and the Orinoco. The soil is fertile, and perfectly
                    level: not a hill nor any other inequality is to be seen as far as the eye can
                    reach. But the appearance of the plains is totally changed at different seasons
                    of the year. During the rainy season they are covered with fine grass, on which
                    numerous herds of cattle graze; and in the time of extreme drought, vegetation
                    being destroyed by the excessive heat of the sun, they appear but a sandy
                    desert. Upon the banks of the rivers, however, vegetation is at all times so
                    profuse and often so thick as to be almost impenetrable. The climate is
                    immoderately hot, and very unhealthy. In some parts the air is pure, and in
                    others vaporous, and full of fine dust raised from the dried mud of the
                    rivers.</p>
                <p part="N">The northern portion of this province has been recently separated into a
                    distinct district called Casanare, which name is now often applied to the whole.
                    In this territory, cacao, maize, yucas, plantains, &amp;c. are produced; and the
                    lakes and rivers furnish abundance of fish for the <pb break="no"
