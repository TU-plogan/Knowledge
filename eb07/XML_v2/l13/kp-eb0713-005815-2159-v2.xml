                    an English poet and miscellaneous writer, was born at Kιrkby-Steven,
                    Westmoreland, in March 1735. He received the rudiments of his education, first
                    at Winton, and afterwards at Appleby, where he early distinguished himself by
                    his assiduity and proficiency. He left school in his eighteenth year, and,
                    having no means of defraying the expense of an university education, engaged
                    himself as private tutor to a family near Ripon. His next occupation was that of
                    assistant in the free school of Wakefield, then superintended by Mr Clarke.
                    Whilst in this situation he took deacon’s orders, and, it is said, became a
                    popular preacher. In the year 1759, Mr Clarke recommended him as preceptor to

                    near Lincoln, who were no fewer than nine in number. During his residence at
                    Hackthorn, he published a volume of poems, which attracted but little notice;
                    and he also wrote some critical pieces, which were rather more fortunate. In
                    1760, he entered his name at Clare-Hall, Cambridge, in order to take the degree
                    of bachelor of divinity: but as his name does not appear in the list of the
                    Cambridge graduates, it is more than probable that he did not succeed in his
                    object. About this time he became enamoured of one of Mr Cracrofťs daughters,
                    and having met with a refusal from the young lady, immediately left his
                    situation. In 1761, he officiated as curate at Dagenham, where he produced a
                    great variety of pieces, some of which he published. His Letters on Religious
                    Retirement were dedicated to Warburton, who returned him a complimentary
                    acknowledgment, in which he advised Langhorne to make some attempt in the cause
                    of religion. In 1764, having obtained the curacy and lectureship of St John’s,
                    Clerkenwell, he was enabled to reside in London, the great and ready mart for
                    literary talents. About this time he engaged with Mr Griffiths as a writer in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Peview,</hi> in which situation he continued until
                    about the year 1769, when his connection with the Review is supposed to have
                    ceased, in consequence of some dispute with the editor. His employment as a
                    critic procured him the acquaintance of many literary men, whilst the vein of
                    ridicule, which he occasionally indulged with more freedom than discretion, made
                    him many enemies, amongst whom were Churchill, Kelly, and Kenrick, libellers by
                    profession. In 1765, he produced a number of pieces, besides publishing an
                    edition of the poems of Collins, with a memoir and critical notes. He replied to
                    Churchill’s Prophecy of Famine, a libel against the Scottish nation, in a poem
                    entitled Genius and Valour, which obtained the approbation of Dr Robertson the
                    historian, and procured for him the degree of doctor in divinity, which was
                    conferred on him by the university of Edinburgh. In 1767, Dr Langhorne married
                    Miss Cracroft, the lady to whom he had so long been attached, and with whom he
                    had never ceased to correspond. But his happiness was of short duration, as Mrs
                    Langhorne died in childbirth, on the 4th of March 1768. Not long after his
                    wife’s death, he went to reside at Folkestone, in Kent, where his brother
                    officiated as perpetual curate. During his residence at this place, the brothers
                    occupied themselves in preparing a new translation of Plutarch’s Lives, which
                    appeared in 1770, and soon became a very popular book. In the year 1772, Dr
                    Langhorne paid a visit to his native country, where he married a second wife,
                    the daughter of a magistrate near Brough, and then set out on a tour through
                    part of France and the Netherlands, the scenery of which afforded new themes for
                    his industrious muse. In 1776 he lost his second wife, who, like the former,
                    died in childbed, leaving him a daughter. In 1777, at the request of the
                    Beuverie family, by whom he was much respected, he was presented by the bishop,
                    Dr Moss, with a prebend in the cathedral of Wells. But his career was now
                    approaching its close. He died on the 1st of April 1779, in the forty-fifth year
                    of his age. In 1804, his son published an edition of his poems in two vols.
                    12mo, with a memoir of the author, to which wc beg to refer our readers for more
                    ample details. Dr Langhorne was a man of an amiable disposition and inoffensive
                    manners, social in his habits, and possessed of a considerable fund of wit,
                    which he never abused or misapplied. The leading characteristics of bis poetry
                    are ease, fluency, and a considerable share of tenderness, without much
                    invention or originality. His prose writings are sufficiently varied to satisfy
                    us that he was a laborious and indefatigable writer. <hi rend="smallcaps"
