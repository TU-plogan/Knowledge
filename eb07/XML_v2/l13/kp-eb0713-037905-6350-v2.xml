                    lettered), an epithet given to such persons amongst the Chinese as are able to
                    read and write their own language. The literati alone are capable of being made
                    mandarins. Literati is also the name of a particular sect, either in religion,
                    philosophy, or politics, consisting principally of the learned men of that
                    country, amongst whom it is called <hi rend="italic">juhiao,</hi> or learned. It
                    had its rise in the year of Christ 1400, when the emperor, to awaken the native
                    affection of the people for knowledge, which had been quite banished by the
                    preceding civil wars, and to stir up emulation amongst the mandarins, selected
                    forty-two of the ablest of the doctors, to whom he gave a commission to compose
                    a body of doctrine agreeable to that of the ancients, which was then become the
                    rule or standard of the learned. The delegates applied themselves to the
                    business with very great attention; but some fancied them rather to have wrested
                    the doctrine of the ancients to make it consist with their own, than to have
                    built up theirs upon the model of the ancients. They speak ot the Deity as if
                    that being were no more than mere nature, or the natural power or virtue that
                    produces, disposes, and preserves the several parts of the universe. He is, say
                    they, a pure, perfect principle, without beginning or end; <pb break="no"

                    of all things, the essence of every being, and that which determines it to be
                    what it is. They make God the soul of the world; they say he is diffused
                    throughout all matter, and produces all the changes which occur in it. In short,
                    it is not easy to determine whether they resolve God into nature, or lift up
                    nature into God; for they ascribe to it many of those things which we attribute
                    to the Deity. This doctrine introduced a refined kind of atheism, instead <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> the idolatry which prevailed before. The work, being
                    composed by so many persons of learning and parts, and approved by the emperor
                    himself, was received with infinite applause by all the people. Many were
                    pleased with it, because it seemed to subvert all religion; others approved of
                    it, because the little religion that it left them could not give them much
                    trouble. And thus was formed the sect of the literati, consisting of the
                    maintainers and adherents to this doctrine. The court, the mandarins, and the
                    persons of fortune and quality, and others, are generally amongst its adherents;
                    but a great part of the common people still hold to their worship of idols. The
                    literati freely tolerate the Mahommedans, because they adore, with them, the
                    king <hi rend="italic">of</hi> heaven, and author of nature; but they entertain
                    a perfect aversion to all sorts of idolaters, and it was once resolved to
                    extirpate them. The disorder this would have occasioned in the empire prevented
                    it; and they now content themselves with condemning them, in general, as
                    heresies, which they do solemnly every year at Pekin.</p>
