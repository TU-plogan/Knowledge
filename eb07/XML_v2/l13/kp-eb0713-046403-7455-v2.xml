                        >Ecclesiastical History,</hi> a religious sect, which arose in Germany about
                    the beginning of the fourteenth century, and was so called, as many writers have
                    thought, from Walter Lollard, who began to dogmatize in 1315, and was afterwards
                    burned at' Cologne; though others think that Lollard was no surname, but merely
                    a term of reproach applied to all heretics who eoncealed the poison of error
                    under the appearance of piety.</p>
                <p part="N">The monk of Canterbury derives the origin of the word Lollard amongst
                    us, from <hi rend="italic">lolium,</hi> a tare; as if the Lollards were the
                    tares sown in Christ’s vineyard. Abelly says that the word Lollard signifies
                    praising God, from the German <hi rend="italic">loben,</hi> to praise, and <hi
                        rend="italic">herr,</hi> Lord; because the Lollards employed themselves in
                    travelling about from place to place, singing psalms and hymns. Others, again,
                    derive <hi rend="italic">lollhard, lullhard,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >lollert,</hi><hi rend="italic">lullert,</hi> as it was written by the
                    ancient Germans, from the old German word <hi rend="italic">lullen,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">lollen,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lallen,</hi> and the
                    termination <hi rend="italic">hard,</hi> with whieh many of the Dutch words end.
                        <hi rend="italic">Lallen</hi> signifies to sing with a low voice, and
                    therefore Lollard is a singer, or one who frequently sings; and in the vulgar
                    tongue of the Germans it denotes a person who is continually praising God with a
                    song, or singing hymns in his praise. The Alexians or Cellites were called <hi
                        rend="italic">Lollards,</hi> beeause they were public singers, who made it
                    their business to inter the bodies of those who died of the plague, and sang a
                    dirge over them in a mournful and indistinet tone as they carried them to the
                    grave. The name was afterwards assumed by persons who dishonoured it; for we
                    find that, amongst those Lollards who made extraordinary pretences to piety and
                    religion, and spent the greater part of their time in meditation, prayer, and
                    such acts of piety, there were many abominable hypocrites, who entertained the
                    most ridiculous opinions, and concealed the most enormous vices under the
                    specious mark of this extraordinary profession.</p>
                <p part="N">Many injurious aspersions were propagated by the priests and monks
                    against those who assumed this name; so that, by degrees, any person who eovered
                    heresy or crime under the appearance of piety was called a <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lollard.</hi> Thus the name was used not to denote any one particular sect,
                    but was formerly common to all persons and all sects who were supposed to be
                    guilty of impiety towards God or the chureh, under an external profession of
                    extraordinary piety. However, many soeieties, consisting both of men and women,
                    under the denomination of <hi rend="italic">Lollards,</hi> were formed in most
                    parts of Germany and Flanders, and were supported partly by their manual
                    labours, and partly by the charitable donations of pious persons. The
                    magistrates and inhabitants of the towns where these brethren and sisters
                    resided, gave them particular marks of favour and protection, on account of
                    their great usefulness to the siek and needy. They were thus supported against
                    their malignant rivals, and obtained many papal constitutions, by which their
                    institute was confirmed, their persons exempted from the cognizance of the
                    inquisitors, and subjected entirely to the jnrisdietion of the bishops; but as
                    these measures were insufficient to secure them from molestation, Charles duke
                    of Burgundy, in the year 1472, obtained a solemn bull from Sixtus IV. ordaining
                    that the Cellites or Lollards should be ranked amongst the religious orders, and
                    delivered from the jurisdiction of the bishops; and in the year 1506 Julius II.
                    granted them still greater privileges. Mosheim informs us that many societies of
                    this kind still subsisted at Cologne, and in the cities of Flanders, though they
                    had evidently departed from their ancient rules.</p>
                <p part="N">Lollard and his followers rejected the saerifice of the mass, extreme
                    unetion, and penanees for sin; arguing that Christ’s sufferings were
                    all-sufficient. He is likewise said to have set aside baptism, as a thing of no
                    effect; and repentance, as not absolutely necessary.. In England, the followers
                    of Wickliffe were by way of reproach called Lollards, from the affinity there
                    existed between some of their tenets and those of that seet; though others are
                    of opinion that the English Lollards came from Germany.’ The Lollards were
                    solemnly condemned by the archbishop of Canterbury and the council of
                    Oxford.</p>
