                    manfacturing county in the north-west of England. This district, which is
                    situated between long. 2. 18. and 3. 7. W., and lat. 53. 23. and 54. 24. N., has
                    Cumberland and Westmoreland on the north-east and north, Yorkshire on the east,
                    Cheshire on the south, and the Irish Sea on the west. Its extreme length is
                    about seventy-four miles, and its greatest breadth forty-four and a half; but
                    the boundaries being very irregular, its outline is about 342 miles, which
                    comprehends an area of 1765 square miles, or 1,129,600 acres. Lancashire forms
                    part of the northern circuit, is situated within the province of York and
                    diocese of Chester, and is divided into sixty-one parishes. The other divisions
                    are hundreds, of which there are six, namely, Lonsdale on the north;
                    Amounderness, Blackburn, and Leyland, in the middle; and Salford and West Derby
                    on the south. Most of these are again popularly subdivided, according to their
                    relative situation, or the names of their towns.</p>
                <p part="N">The greater part of this county, from Rossall Point on the north, to the
                    Mersey on the south, except where it is indented by the estuary of the Ribble on
                    the west, lies tolerably compact, in the form of an irregular square. To the
                    north of Rossall Point, till it meets the county of Westmoreland, it is very
                    narrow, with a sinuous boundary <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193202081?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2081-0052"/>on all
                    sides; and to the north-east there is a considerable tract called Furness,
                    separated from the rest by extensive sands, where the river Ken, from
                    Westmoreland, discharges itself into the Bay of Morecombe. Opposite the sðuth
                    point of Furness is the island of Walney, and other seven, of which the largest
                    is Old Barrow. On the northeast and north much of the surface is occupied with
                    hillsand moors, particularly in Furness, where the highest grounds have the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Fells</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and also on the east,
                    where it is bounded by Yorkshire; but the south and west quarters spread out for
                    the most part into low and fertile tracts, though not without being interrupted
                    by pretty large fields of moss. Chat Moss, near Worsley, and Pilling Moss,
                    farther to the north, are the most extensive; but many other, though smaller,
                    tracts occur in various parts. Along the coast there is also a considerable
                    extent of sandy marsh land, particularly towards the north, near Lancaster and
                    Warton, at the estuaries of the Leven and Duddon, in the north-east or Furness
                    district, and about the banks of the island of Walney.</p>
                <p part="N">The climate of Lancashire is chiefly distinguished for its humidity.
                    According to a register kept at Liverpool from 1784 to 1792, the least quantity
                    of rain yearly was twenty-four and an eighth inches in 1788, and the greatest
                    fifty-four and a fourth in 1792. At Lancaster, in the latter year, the quantity
                    of rain was nearly sixty-six inches. Four inches have been known to fall in the
                    course of a night. The mean heat at Lancaster, from 1784 to 1790, was 51° 8'.
                    The prevailing winds are from the south, south-west, and north-east. As fogs are
                    not frequent, nor the stagnant waters of any considerable extent, the climate is
                    not insalubrious.</p>
                <p part="N">The soils of this extensive district are necessarily various. The higher
                    grounds, covered with heath and broken with rocks, have a sterile moorish soil;
                    but towards their base, and in the valleys which they form, it is for the most
                    part of the nature of holme. Loam and clay of various degrees of consistence
                    prevail on the flat grounds, with portions of sand, gravel, and moss; and on the
                    banks of the rivers, and at their estuaries, there are large tracts of an
                    alluvial description. The under stratum of the heathy grounds is sandstone or
                    freestone of different colours; a blue rock, popularly called whinstone, is more
                    common in the fell tracts of Furness. Limestone prevails on the north-west, and
                    towards the eastern boundaries. This and the freestone rock occasionally come in
                    contact with one another in a very remarkable manner, a striking instance of
                    which occurs near the town of Chipping, at the termination of the high ridge of
                    Long-ridge Fell. In some places towards the eastern border, coal approaches so
                    near the surface, as to constitute the substratum of the soil, and may be seen
                    cropping out at Townley Park, and on the rising grounds on both sides. Marl is
                    frequently found below the soil in the low grounds, and also under the mosses.
                    Much of the vale land consists of rich pastures and meadows; what part of it is
                    under tillage is very productive, and in many instances or a quality to yield
                    turnips and other green crops, as well as grain. A strong clayey loam, however,
                    appears to be the predominant soil throughout the low grounds on the south and
                    west, which, with the wetness of the climate, renders cultivation more difficult
                    and hazardous than in many other districts.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal mineral substances are coal, copper, lead, and iron. The
                    first, and in a manufacturing district by far the most important, of these, is
                    in great abundance in several parts of the county. The great coal tract
                    commences below Prescot on the south, and, crossing the county in a north-east
                    direction, passes into Yorkshire; but coal abounds farther to the south-east,
                    near Manchester, and also to the north above Lancaster. Its quality, as well as
                    the thickness of the beds, and the depth at which it is wrought, has
                    considerable diversity; but it is chiefly of a bituminous description. Cannel
                    coal is found near Wigan, and at other places, and sometimes in contact with the
                    black coal, or a little mixed with it, as at the pits near Layton Hall. Copper
                    is met with in the rough barren mountains, towards the northern extremity of the
                    high Furness or Fell district, particularly at Coniston, Muckle Gill, and
                    Hartriggs; but has not been found to the south of Lancaster Sands in such
                    quantities as to be wrought with advantage. Lead occurs towards the north and
                    north-east parts of the county, but in no great quantity. Iron is wrought to the
                    north of Lancaster Sands, in the liberty of Furness. Though found in other
                    quarters, it is not in such abundance, so as to make the working of it
                    profitable. In the northern part of the high Furness tract, quarries of blue
                    slate have been opened. Sandstone is wrought in most parts of the county south
                    of the Sands, and limestone, though it is found also in the Furness district, is
                    most abundant on the Lancaster side. The main tracts of this rock are in the
                    northern divisions above Lancaster, and near Chipping and Clitheroe, towards the
                    borders of Yorkshire. More to the south, that is, throughout the larger and more
                    valuable portion of the county, it occurs but seldom, and not to a great
                    extent.</p>
                <p part="N">Lancashire is naturally well supplied with waters, of which its
                    inhabitants have industriously availed themselves in their manufacturing
                    establishments, and in facilitating the transport of their products of all
                    kinds. The principal rivers are the Mersey, the Irwell, the Ribble, and the
                    Loyne or Lune. The Mersey, after receiving the Etherow and the Goyt from
                    Cheshire, and the Tame from Yorkshire, becomes a large river at the town of
                    Stockport, and, after a winding course between this county and Cheshire, enters
                    the Irish Sea a little below the town of Liverpool. By means of an artificial
                    cut, it has been made navigable for vessels of sixty or seventy tons from
                    Liverpool to the mouth of the Irwell, up which river the navigation is continued
                    to Manchester.</p>
                <p part="N">The Irwell, which has its source amongst the hilly ranges to the south
                    of Haslingden, also receives several streams, and flowing through a part of
                    Manchester, where it is advantageously employed by the different manufactories,
                    especially those of spinning, dyeing, and calico printing, falls into the Mersey
                    a little below Fíixton. The Ribble is a large river, which intersects the county
                    from east to west. It enters Lancashire from Yorkshire, above the town of
                    Clitheroe, and, flowing through the beautiful vale of Ribblesdale, joins the
                    Irish Sea a little below the town of Preston, to which it is navigable for small
                    vessels. The Loyne or Lune, also a large river, has its source in the fells of
                    Westmoreland, and comes into Lancashire a little below Kirkby-Lonsdale, and,
                    passing by the town of Lancaster, afterwards expands into a broad estuary, and
                    empties itself into the Irish Sea, The Alt, the Douglas, the Wyer, the Winster,
                    the Leven, the Crake, and the Dudden, are also considerable streams; and many
                    others, though in a general description not worthy of notice for their size,
                    afford the most important facilities to the manufactories established on their
                    courses. There are several pieces of water in the county, known by the names of
                    lakes, waters, meres, and tarns. Of these the most considerable is Coniston Lake
                    or Thurston Water, and Esthwaite Water, both in Furness. With these may be
                    mentioned the Lake of Windermere, which, though not properly belonging to
                    Lancashire, enters it by its southern point, and forms its boundary for eight or
                    ten miles. Mineral springs have been found at Cartmel, Fluke-borough, Wigan,
                    Latham House, near Ormskĩrk, and other places.</p>
                <p part="N">Of the canals by which a great part of this county is traversed in
                    almost every direction, it would be difficult to <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193202094?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2094-0053"/>give an
                    intelligible description without references to a map, and the limits of this
                    article admit only of noticing them very generally. The great importance of an
                    interior communication by water had been recognised in this quarter a
                    considerable time before any attempt was made to form one entirely artificial.
                    The first object was to render some of the rivers navigable, as in the instance
                    of the Mersey and Irwell, already mentioned, to effect which, acts of parliament
                    were obtained in 1719 and 1720. But the droughts and tides which affect the
                    navigation of these and other rivers have been found to occasion so much
                    inconvenience, that more recently a preference has been given to channels of
                    communication formed wholly by human labour. The first work of this description
                    in Lancashire, and probably in England, was the Sankey Canal, from the Mersey to
                    near St Helen’s, which, including its branches, extends nearly twelve miles. It
                    was finished about sixty years ago. Besides this canal, the county is
                    intersected by nine others, four of which communicate with the populous town of
                    Manchester. Of these we can only notice the more considerable. The Duke of
                    Bridgewater’s Canal, in as far as it belongs to Lancashire, commences in the
                    suburbs of Manchester, and terminates at Pennington, near the town of Leigh.
                    Under the town of Manchester a portion of it passes into arched tunnels, from
                    one of which coals are hoisted up out of the barges below, through a shaft, and
                    delivered into a large coal-yard in the main street. Before it reaches the
                    coal-works at Worsley, it is carried under ground for three quarters of a mile.
                    The Lancaster Canal commences at Kirkby-Kendal in Westmoreland, and terminates
                    at West Houghton, to the eastward of Wigan, after a course of 75^ miles. The
                    principal object in executing this great work was to open a ready communication
                    between the coal and limestone districts, and between the port of Lancaster and
                    the populous towns on the north and south. It is on an average seven feet deep,
                    and is navigable by boats of sixty tons burden. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal is
                    of still greater length. It extends between the towns of Liverpool and Leeds,
                    along a line of 107^ miles, and communicating at the latter place with the Aire,
                    which is navigable to the German Ocean, and at the former with the Mersey, which
                    falls into the Irish Sea; the navigation is thus completed between the eastern
                    and western seas. On this canal flats of forty-two tons are employed in the coal
                    trade between Leeds and Wigan, and passage-boats are in constant use between
                    these towns. The other canals, though works of great importance when each is
                    considered by itself, are much inferior to those we have mentioned.</p>
                <p part="N">A considerable portion of the territory of this county belongs in
                    property to his majesty, as Duke of Lancaster. The greater part of this consists
                    of what is called <hi rend="italic">forest lands,</hi> all of which are situated
                    in the most northern parts. It is held in general on leases for thirty years,
                    and yields but an inconsiderable revenue. A few other estates are also of
                    considerable extent; but, generally speaking, landed property is much
                    subdivided, and hence Lancashire has a greater number of land-owners than any
                    other county in England, Middlesex excepted; many of the estates not affording a
                    rental of L.200 a year, and not a few being below L.50.</p>
                <p part="N">Lancashire does not excel in its agriculture. Only about a fourth of its
                    surface is computed to be under corn and other tillage crops, the other three
                    fourths, subject to a deduction for wastes, roads, &amp;c. being chiefly
                    occupied in grazing and for the purposes of the dairy; and it has been estimated
                    that it does not raise corn sufficient for the support of its population for
                    more than three months in the year. All the different sorts of corn, however,
                    are cultivated, and, where the soil is naturally fertile, the crops are often
                    abundant; but turnips and other ameliorating crops are not in general use, nor
                    always, where grown to some extent, properly attended to. Potatoes, however, are
                    cultivated not only upon a large scale, but with great care and success; this
                    root, with oatmeal, forming the principal food of the working classes. They were
                    introduced into this county from Ireland, and are said to have been cultivated
                    here long before they had found their way into most other parts of England.
                    Lancashire was long noted for its breed of horned cattle, but a variety of other
                    breeds have been introduced, particularly the Holderness, or short-horned, which
                    are preferred to the Lancashire in the milk dairies near the town, and sometimes
                    also in those at some distance, where the principal object is butter. The native
                    breed is the kind more commonly kept for the cheese dairies, farther into the
                    interior. A cow yields, upon an average throughout the year, from eight to
                    twelve quarts of milk daily, or from four to six pounds of butter in the week,
                    or from three to four hundredweight of cheese in the year. A considerable number
                    of good horses are bred and reared, but its sheep stocks are inconsiderable, and
                    seldom of a valuable description. Farms are in general small, and held either on
                    short leases or without any lease at all, so that a tenant has no encouragement
                    to invest capital in the improvement of the soil.</p>
                <p part="N">This district, however, is greatly distinguished by its manufactures and
                    commerce, which afford employment to three fourths of its crowded population. Of
                    the former, that of cotton, which is here conducted in all its branches on the
                    most extensive scale, has long been the most considerable. The town of
                    Manchester, where it seems to have had its origin in England, is still its
                    principal seat, though several of the other towns, such as Preston, Garstang,
                    Blackburn, Clitheroe, Middleton, Burnley, Wigan, Bury, Bolton, and Ashton, have
                    a considerable share of it; and, indeed, it is more or less spread over the
                    greater part of the county. At Ravenhead, near Prescot, plate-glass and mirrors
                    are made to a considerable extent; brass, pewter, and copper works are carried
                    on at Wigan and at St Helen’s; Warrington has manufactures of sail-cloth,
                    linens, and checks, with the making of pins and glass, and iron-founderies; and
                    Rochdale and Ashton furnish a variety of the coarser articles of woollen.</p>
                <p part="N">From the great extent and variety of its manufactures, it is natural to
                    infer that its commerce must be upon a scale proportionally extensive, and it is
                    so. Liverpool, as a commercial town, is now perhaps second only to London; and
                    to this rank it has attained from a very low beginning little more than a
                    century ago. In prosperous times, the enterprise of its merchants exchanges the
                    products of British capital and industry with those of almost every climate;
                    and, at all times, it carries on an extensive commerce with America and the West
                    Indies, and with Ireland; to which has been recently added a large share of the
                    East India trade. The ports of Preston, Poulton, Warrington, Ulverston, and
                    Lancaster, the county town, are chiefly employed in the coasting trade.</p>
                <p part="N">As a considerable portion of the people of Lancashire are employed in
                    working up goods for a foreign market, the condition of the labouring classes,
                    in particular, is much affected by the changes which occur from time to time in
                    that market, and which it is not always possible to anticipate. They are
                    sometimes in the receipt of wages more than sufficient for their comfortable
                    subsistence, and at other times many are thrown out of employment altogether,
                    and the rest retained at wages confessedly inadequate to their support. This is
                    true in an especial manner of its great staple, the cotton manufacture. From
                    this cause, and perhaps also owing to the inconsiderate habits and want of
                    foresight which such fluctuations are apt to engender, the poor-rates of this
                    county amounted, in 1815, to about L.400,000, whereas, forty years before, they
                    were <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202107?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-2107-0054"/>little more than L.50,000. Since that period
                    up to the present time (1836), though the whole number of the inhabitants has
                    increased nearly half a million, there has not been a corresponding increase on
                    the assessments for the poor, but, on the contrary, a diminution, nor, except in
                    the year 1832, has the amount quite reached that of 1815 and 1816.</p>
                <p part="N">The whole population of the county, at the three decennial enumerations,
                    has been as follows :—In 1801, 672,731; in 1811, 828,309; in 1821, 1.052,859;
                    and in 1831, 1,335,800; thus showing a doubling of the inhabitants in thirty
                    years. The burials, including both the registered and unregistered, appear,
                    between the years 1821 and 1833, to have been one in forty-five of the whole of
                    the number then living. The illegitimate births bear a higher proportion to the
                    whole births than in any other county of England, except Hereford and
                    Shropshire, where, as in this county, they are one in thirteen, whereas in the
                    whole of England they are only one in twenty.</p>
                <p part="N">According to the laborious production of Mr Rickman, the occupation of
                    the people is thus described.</p>
