                <p part="N"><label type="entry">LUCKNOW</label>, a city of Hindustan, in the
                    province of Oude, situated on the south bank of the river Goomty, over which
                    there are two bridges, one a very noble Gothic edifice of stone, and the other a
                    platform laid upon boats, and merely connecting the King’s Park with the palace.
                    The Goomty is navigable for boats of a common size at all seasons of the year,
                    and falls into the Ganges between Benares and Gazypoor. The last sovereign,
                    Saadut Ali, had brought over an iron bridge from England, and a place was
                    prepared for its erection; but, on his death, his successor declined prosecuting
                    the work, on the ground that it was unlucky; so that it is now left to be
                    destroyed with rust. The streets where the lower classes reside consist of mean
                    houses built of clay, “with the filthiest lanes between them,” says Bishop
                    Heber, “that I ever went through, and so narrow that we were obliged to reduce
                    our front, and even a single elephant did not pass very easily. A swarm of
                    beggars,” he continues, in the lively description which he gives of the aspect
                    of the town and its population, “occupied every angle, and the steps of every
                    door, and all or nearly all the remaining population were, to my surprise, as
                    much loaded with arms as the inhabitants of the country; a circumstance which
                    told ill for the police of the town, but added considerably to its picturesque
                    effect. Grave men in palanquins, counting their beads, and looking like
                    moullahs, had all two or three sword or buckler lacqueys attending <pb

                    />on them. People of more consequence, on their elephants, had each a retinue of
                    shield, spear, and gun, little inferior ito that by which we were surrounded;
                    and even the lounging people of the lower ranks, in the streets and shopdoors,
                    had their shields over their shoulders, and their swords carried in one hand.”
                    Lucknow is a very ancient city. It was formerly the residence óf the governors
                    or nabobs of Oude, but was abandoned by Shujah ad Dow-i∣eh after the battle of
                    Buxar; on his death in 1774, however, his successor returned to it; and being
                    now the residence of the kings of Oude, it has been greatly increased, md
                    embellished by palaces and other public buildings; md the bankers and men of
                    property having accompa- 'ιied the court, Lucknow became one of the largest and
                    ∙ichest towns in Hindustan. In advancing into the town, he buildings begin to
                    improve, though the streets con-inue to be equally narrow and dirty. Some of the
                    streets ire, however, more spacious; and one in particular is nentioned as being
                    both wide and handsome. From he dwelling of the British resident, all the way
                    down he principal street, and afterwards through the park of Dil-Koushar and the
                    neighbouring drives, Lucknow appeared to Bishop Heber to have more resemblance
                    to ,ome of the smaller European capitals, such as Dres-len, than any other town
                    which he had seen in India. There are several palaces in Lucknow belonging to
                    the ing, but none of them are very striking buildings. There ⅛ one close to the
                    residency, which is merely a clus-fer of mean houses, with some morsels of showy
                    architecture intermingled like the offices of a college. The ιinister ’ s house
                    is a very large pile of buildings, in a dirty art of the town. There are many
                    stately khans, and □me handsome mosques and pagodas, scattered in dif-ιrent
                    corners of the most wretched alleys. The most triking buildings in Lucknow are
                    the tombs of the late ffawab Saadut Ali and of the mother of the present king,
                    he gate of Constantinople, and the imumbra or cathedral. Γhe latter building
                    consists of two courts, rising with a Jeep ascent one above another. It
                    contains, besides a blendid mosque, a college for instruction in Mussul-san law;
                    apartments for the religious establishment main-fined here; and a noble gallery,
                    in the midst of which, nder a brilliant tabernacle of silver, cut glass, and
                    previous stones, lie buried the remains of its founder Asuph Hi Dowlah. The
                    whole is in a very noble style of cast- ∣∙n Gothic, and is distinguished by
                    richness and varie- ∣f, as well as by the just proportions and general good ιste
                    of its principal features. Close to this fine group is ∣∣large and handsome,
                    though a dull and neglected look- ∣g pile, which is the palace or prison
                    appropriated to the «fortunate widows and concubines of deceased sovc-ligns.
                    There is a small summer palace of the king’s ioout three miles from the city, to
                    which there is a plea-ιtnt ride. The house is small and ugly, but the park is
                    intensive, and it is well stocked with Indian deer, and pith fine red deer. The
                    king has also a large menagerie, ⅛ntaining a great number of scarce and curious
                    animals; nd, on the banks of the river Goomty, in a well wooded ∣rk, is a large
                    collection of different varieties of cows, «reels, and deer, and five or six
                    very large rhinoceroses, ⅛nongst the curiosities in the neighbourhood is
                    Constantia, fie residence of the late General Martin, who, from being «common
                    soldier, rose to a high rank in the Company’s ftny. His house is a large and
                    whimsical building, and the göunds are laid out in the worst possible taste,
                    displaying i the outline and arrangements the eccentric genius of the ¢ntriver.
                    To the house is annexed a very fine garden ad extensive grounds. The population
                    of Lucknow is ⅛ιimated at 300,000; and Bishop Heber is of opinion that iis
                    sufficiently crowded to contain that number. There i⅛n Lucknow a considerable
                    number of European inha bitants, consisting of the numerous dependents of the
                    residency, and those Europeans and half castes retained by the king in his
                    employment. There are also many tradesmen amongst both these descriptions of
                    persons, and a strange medley of adventurers of all sects and nations, who
                    ramble thither in search of employment, which, however, they seldom find. It is
                    650 miles travelling distance from Calcutta, from Delhi 280, from Agra 202, and
                    from Benares 189 miles. Long. 80. 55. E. Lat. 26. 51. N. The district of Lucknow
                    is adjacent to the city, and is situated between the 26th and 27th degrees of N.
                    lat. The country is generally a sandy soil, covered, after a storm, with puddles
                    of water. Some parts, however, are more fertile and better cultivated. The
                    country is watered by the Ganges, the Goggrah, and the Goomty; and over the
                    small river Sye is a bridge of fifteen arches, an excellent specimen of
                    Mahommedan architecture. The towns are mostly built of brick, and there are
                    still in many parts extensive mounds of brick dust, the only vestiges of ancient
                    cities. (Rennell’s <hi rend="italic">Memoir of a Map of Hindustan;</hi> Lord <hi
