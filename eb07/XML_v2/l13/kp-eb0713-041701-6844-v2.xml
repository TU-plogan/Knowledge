                    the arithmetical operations of multiplication, division, and the extraction of
                    roots, were at one time considerable obstacles to the improvement of various
                    branches of knowledge, and in particular the science of astronomy. But about the
                    end of the sixteenth century and the beginning of the seventeenth, several
                    mathematicians began to consider by what means they might simplify these
                    operations, or substitute for them others more easily performed. Their efforts
                    produced some ingenious contrivances for abridging calculations; but of these
                    the most complete by far was that of John Napier, baron of Merchiston, in
                    Scotland, who invented a system of numbers called <hi rend="italic"
                        >logarithms,</hi> so adapted to the numbers to be multiplied or divided,
                    that these being arranged in the form of a table, each opposite the number
                    called its logarithm, the product of any two numbers in the table was found
                    opposite that formed by the addition of their logarithms; and, on the contrary,
                    the quotient arising from the division of one number by another was found
                    opposite that formed by the subtraction of the logarithm of the divisor from
                    that of the dividend; and similar simplifications took place in the still more
                    laborious operations of involution and evolution. But before we proceed to
                    relate more particularly the circumstances of this invention, it will be proper
                    to give a general view of the nature of logarithms, and of the circumstances
                    which render them of use in calculation.</p>
                <p part="N">Let there be formed two series of numbers, the one constituting a

                <p part="N">Here the terms in the arithmetical series are called the <hi
                        rend="italic">logarithms</hi> of the corresponding terms of the geometrical
                    series; that is, 0 is the logarithm of 1, and 1 is the logarithm of 2, and 2 is
                    the logarithm of 4, and 3 that of 8, and so on.</p>
                <p part="N">From the manner in which the two series are related to each other, it
                    will readily appear by induction that the logarithms of the terms of the
                    geometrical series have the two following properties:</p>
                <p part="N">1. The sum of the logarithms of any two numbers or terms in the
                    geometrical series is the logarithm of that number, or term of the series, which
                    is equal to their product.</p>
                <p part="N">For example, let the terms of the geometrical series be 4 and 32; the
                    corresponding terms of the arithmetical series (that is, their logarithms) are 2
                    and 5: now the product of the numbers is 128, and the sum of their logarithms is
                    7; and it appears by inspection of the two series, that the latter number is the
                    logarithm of the former, agreeing with the proposition we are illustrating. In
                    like manner, if the numbers or terms of the geometrical series be 16 and 64, the
                    logarithms of which are 4 and 6, we find from the table that 10=4 + 6 is the
                    logarithm of 1024= 16 × 64; and so of any other numbers in the table.</p>
                <p part="N">2. The difference of the logarithms of any two numbers or terms of the
                    geometrical series is the logarithm of that term which is the quotient arising
                    from the division of the one number by the other.</p>
                <p part="N">Take, for example, the terms 128 and 32, the logarithms of which are 7
                    and 5; the greater of these numbers divided by the less is 4, and the difference
                    of their logarithms is 2; and by inspecting the two series, this, last number
                    will be found to be the logarithm of the former. In like manner, if the terms of
                    the geometrical series be 1024 and 16, the logarithms of which are 10 and 4, we
                    find that 1024 ÷ 16 = 64, and that 10 — 4 = 6; now, in the table, the latter
                    number, viz. 6, is the logarithm of the former, 64.</p>
                <p part="N">These two properties of logarithms, the second of which indeed is an
                    immediate consequence of the first, enable us to find with great facility the
                    product or the quotient of any two terms of a geometrical series to which there
                    is adapted an arithmetical series, so that each number has its logarithm
                    opposite to it, as in the preceding short table. For it is evident, that to
                    multiply two numbers, we have only to add their logarithms, and opposite to that
                    logarithm which is the sum we shall find the product required. Thus, to multiply
                    16 by 128; to 4 the logarithm of 16, add 7 the logarithm of 128, and opposite
                    the sum 11, we find 2048, the product sought. On the other hand, to divide any
                    number in the table by any other, we subtract the logarithm of the divisor from
                    that of the dividend, and look for the remainder among the logarithms, and
                    opposite to it we find the number sought. Thus, to divide 2048 by 128; from 11,
                    the logarithm of 2048, we subtract 7, the logarithm of 128, and opposite the
                    remainder 4, we find 16, the quotient sought.</p>
                <p part="N">Let us now suppose any number of geometrical means to be interposed
                    between each two adjoining terms of the preceding geometrical series, and the
                    same number of arithmetical means between every two adjoining terms of the
                    arithmetical series; then, as the results will still be a geometrical and an
                    arithmetical series, the interpolated terms of the latter will be the logarithms
                    of the corresponding terms of the former, and the two new series will have the
                    very same properties as the original series.</p>
                <p part="N">If we suppose the number of interpolated means to be very great, it will
                    follow that among the terms of the resulting geometrical series, some one or
                    other will be found nearly equal to any proposed number whatever. Therefore,
                    although the preceding table exhibits the logarithms of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, &amp;c.
                    but does not contain those of the intermediate numbers, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10,
                    &amp;c. yet it is easy to conceive that a table might be formed by interpolation
                    which should contain, amongst the terms of the geometrical series, all numbers
                    whatever to a certain extent (or at least others very nearly equal to them),
                    together with their logarithms. If such a table were constructed, or at least if
                    such terms <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206857?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-6857-0418"/>of the geometrieal progression were found,
                    together with their logarithms, as were either accurately equal to, or
                    eoin-eided nearly with, all numbers within certain limits (for example, between
                    1 and 100,000), then, as often as we had occasion to multiply or divide any
                    numbers contained in that table, we might evidently obtain the products or
                    quotients by the simple operations of addition and subtraction.</p>
                <p part="N">The first invention of logarithms has been attributed by some to
                    Longomontanus, and by others to Juste Byrge, two mathematicians contemporary
                    with Napier; but there is no reason to suppose that either of these antieipated
                    him, for Longomontanus never published any thing on the subject, although he
                    lived thirty-three years after Napier had made known his discovery; and as to
                    Byrge, he is indeed known to have printed a table containing an arithmetical and
                    a geometrieal progression written opposite to eaeh other, so as to form in
                    effeet a system of logarithms of the same kind as those invented by Napier,
                    without however explaining their nature and use, although it appears from the
                    title he intended to do so, but was probably prevented by some cause unknown to
                    us. But this work was not printed till 1620, six years after Napier had
                    published his discovery, namely, in 1611, in a book entitled <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mirifici</hi><hi rend="italic">Logarithmorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Canonis
                        Descriptio</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but he reserved the construction of
                    the numbers till the opinion of the learned concerning his invention should be
                    known. It is therefore with good reason that Napier is now universally
                    considered as the first, and most probably the only inventor. His work contains
                    a table of the natural sines and cosines, and their logarithms, for every minute
                    of the quadrant, as also the differences between the logarithmic sines and
                    eosines, whieh are in effeet the logarithmic tangents. There is no table of the
                    logarithms of numbers; but preeepts are given, by whieh they, as well as the
                    logarithmic tangents, may be found from the table of natural and logarithmic
                    sines.</p>
                <p part="N">In explaining the nature of logarithms, Napier supposes some determinate
                    line which represents the radius of a eirele to be continually diminished, so as
                    to have successively all possible values, and thus to be equal to every sine,
                    one after another, throughout the quadrant. And he supposes this diminution to
                    be effected by a point moving from one extremity towards the other extremity (or
                    rather some point very near it), with a motion that is not uniform, but
                    deereases gradually in such a manner, that if the whole time between the
                    beginning and the end of the motion be eoneeived to be divided into a very great
                    number of equal portions, the decrements taken away in each of these shall be to
                    one another as the respective remainders of the line. According to this mode of
                    conceiving the line to deerease, it is easy to show that at the end of any
                    successive equal intervals of time from the beginning of the motion, the
                    portions of the line which remain will constitute a decreasing geometrieal
                    progression.</p>
                <p part="N">Again, he supposes another line to be generated by a point which moves
                    along it equably, or whieh passes over equal intervals of it in equal times.
                    Thus the portions of the line generated at the end of any equal successive
                    intervals of time from the beginning of the motion will form a series of
                    quantities in arithmetical progression. Now if the two motions be supposed to
                    begin together, the remainders of the one line at the end of any equal intervals
                    of time will form a series of quantities in geometrieal progression, while the
                    corresponding portions generated of the other-line will constitute a series in
                    arithmetical progression, so that the latter will be the logarithms of the
                    former. And as the terms of the geometrical progression deerease continually
                    from radius, which is the greatest term, to 0, while the terms of the
                    corresponding arithmetical progression increase from 0 upwards, according to
                    Napier’s system the logarithm of radius is 0, and the logarithms of the sines

                <p part="N">Napier’s work having been written in Latin, was translated into English
                    by Mr Edward Wright, an ingenious mathematician of that period, and inventor of
                    the principles of what is eommonly though erroneously called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mercator s sailing.</hi> The translation being sent to Napier for his
                    perusal, was returned with his approbation, and with the addition of a few
                    lines, intimating that he intended to make some alterations in the system of
                    logarithms in a second edition. Mr Wright died soon after he received baek his
                    translation; but it was published after his death in 1616, aecompanied with a
                    dedication by his son to the East India Company, and a preface by Henry Briggs,
                    who afterwards distinguished himself by improving the form or system of
                    logarithms. Mr Briggs likewise gave in this work the description and draught of
                    a scale whieh had been invented by Wright, as also various methods of his own
                    for finding a logarithm to a given number, and a number to a given logarithm, by
                    means of Napier’s table, the use of which had been attended with some
                    ineonvenienee, on aeeount of its containing only sueh numbers as were the
                    natural sines to every minute of the quadrant and their logarithms. There was an
                    additional inconvenience in using the table, arising from the logarithms being
                    partly positive and partly negative. The latter of these was, however, well
                    remedied by John Speidell in his <hi rend="italic">New Logarithms,</hi> first
                    published in 1619, whieh contained the sines, eosines, tangents, cotangents,
                    seeants, and eoseeants, and given in such a form as to be all positive; and the
                    former was still more completely removed by an additional table, which he gave
                    in the sixth impression of his work in 1624, and which contained the logarithms
                    of the integers 1, 2, 3,4, &amp;c. to 1000, together with their differences and
                    arithmetical complements, &amp;c. This table, which is of great use in finding
                    fluents, is commonly ealled <hi rend="italic">hyperbolic logarithms,</hi>
                    because the numbers serve to express the areas contained between a hyperbola and
                    its asymptote, and limited by ordinates drawn parallel to the other asymptote.
                    This name, however, is certainly improper, as the same spaees may represent the
                    logarithms of any system whatever.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1619, Robert Napier, son of the inventor of logarithms, published a

                    1620 at Lyons in France. In 1618 or 1619, Benjamin Ursinus, mathematician to the
                    elector of Brandenburg, published Napier’s tables of logarithms in his <hi

                <p part="N">In the same year, 1624. the eelebrated John Kepler published, at

                    />preface to this last he says, that several of the professors of mathematics in
                    Upper Germany, and more especially those who were advanced in years, and grown
                    averse to new methods of reasoning which carried them out of their old
                    principles and habits, doubted whether Napier’s demonstration of the property of
                    logarithms was perfectly true, and whether the application of them to
                    trigonometrical calculations might not be unsafe, and lead the calculator who
                    should trust in them to erroneous results; and in either case, whether the
                    doctrine were true or not, they scarcely considered Napier’s demonstration of it
                    as legitimate and satisfactory. This opinion induced Kepler to compose the
                    above-mentioned work, in which the whole doctrine is treated in a manner
                    strictly geometrical, and free from the considerations of motion to which those
                    elderly Germans had objected.</p>
                <p part="N">On the publication of Napier’s Logarithms, Mr FIenry Briggs, some time
                    professor of geometry in Gresham College, London, and afterwards Savilian
                    professor of geometry at Oxford, applied himself with great earnestness to the
                    study and improvement of them. From the particular view which Napier took of the
                    subject, and the manner in which he conceived logarithms to be generated, it
                    happened that in his system the logarithms of a series of numbers which
                    increased in a decuple ratio (as 1, 10, 100, 1000, &amp;c.) formed a decreasing
                    arithmetical series, whose common difference was 2∙320585l. But it occurred to
                    Briggs that it would be better and more conformable to the received decimal
                    notation, to adopt a system in which the logarithms of the terms of such a
                    geometrical series should differ from each other by unity or 1. This idea Briggs
                    communicated to the public in his lectures, and also to Napier himself. He even
                    went twice to Edinburgh to converse with him on the subject; and, on his first
                    visit, Napier said that be had also formerly thought of the same improvement,
                    but that he chose to publish the logarithms he had previously calculated, till
                    such time as his health and convenience would allow him to make others more
                    commodious. And whereas, in the change which Briggs proposed, it was intended to
                    make the logarithms of the sines to increase from 0 (the logarithm of radius) to
                    infinity, whilst the sines themselves should decrease, it was suggested to him
                    by Napier that it would be better to make them increase, so that 0, instead of
                    being the logarithm of radius, should be the logarithm of 1, and that 100,000,
                    &amp;c. should be the logarithm of radius. This Briggs admitted would be an
                    improvement; and having changed the numbers he had already calculated so as to
                    make them suit Napier’s modification of his plan, he returned with them next
                    year to Edinburgh, and submitted them to his perusal.</p>
                <p part="N">It appears, therefore, that whether Napier or Briggs was the inventor of
                    this improved system of logarithms which has since been universally adopted,
                    Napier had suggested to begin with the low number 1, and to make the logarithms,
                    or the artificial numbers, as he had always called them, to increase with the
                    natural numbers, instead of decreasing; which, however, made no alteration in
                    the figures, but only in their affections or signs, changing them from negative
                    to positive.</p>
                <p part="N">On Briggs’s return from Edinburgh, in 1617, he printed the first
                    thousand logarithms to eight places of figures, besides the index, with the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Logarithmorum Chilias</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >prima;</hi> but these seem not to have been published till after the death
                    of Napier, for in his preface he expresses a hope that the circumstances which
                    led to a change in the system would be explained in Napier’s posthumous work,
                    about to appear. But although Napier had intimated in a note he had given in
                    Wright’s translation of the <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Mirificus,</hi> as well as in his <hi rend="italic">Rabdologia,</hi>
                    printed in 1617, that he intended to alter the scale, yet he does not state that
                    Briggs was the first to think of this improvement, or to publish it. And as
                    nothing was said on this point in Napier’s posthumous work published in 1619 by
                    his son, Briggs took occasion, in his <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Logarithmixa,</hi> to assert his claims to the improvement
                    which he had carried into execution. But he has by no means proved that he
                    himself, and not Napier, was the first who had thought of such improvements.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1620, Mr Edmund Gunter published his <hi rend="italic">Canon of
                        Triangles,</hi> which contains the artificial or logarithmic sines and
                    tangents to every minute to seven places of figures besides the index, the
                    logarithm of radius being 10. These logarithms are of the kind which had been
                    agreed upon between Napier and Briggs, and they were the first tables of
                    logarithmic sines and tangents that were published of this sort. Gunter also, in
                    1623, reprinted the same in his book <hi rend="italic">De Sectore</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Radio,</hi> together with the <hi

                    same year he applied the logarithms of numbers, sines, and tangents, to straight
                    lines drawn upon a ruler. This instrument is now in common, use for navigation
                    and other purposes, and is commonly called <hi rend="italic">Gunter s

                <p part="N">The discoveries in logarithms were carried to France by Mr Edmund
                    Wingate, but not first of all, as he says in the preface to his book. He
                    published at Paris in 1624 two small tracts in French upon logarithms, which
                    were reprinted with improvements at London in 1626.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1624, Briggs published his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic">Logarithmica,</hi> a stupendous work,
                    considering the short time he had been in preparing it. He there gives the
                    logarithms of 30,000 natural numbers to fourteen places of figures, besides the
                    index; namely, from 1 to 20,000, and from 90,000 to 100,000, together with the
                    differences of the logarithms. He also gives an ample treatise on their
                    construction and use, and he earnestly solicits others to undertake the
                    computation of the intermediate numbers, offering to give instructions, and
                    paper ready ruled for that purpose, to any person inclined to contribute to the
                    completion of so valuable a w ork. By this invitation, he had hopes of
                    collecting materials for the logarithms of the intermediate 70,000 numbers,
                    whilst he should employ his time upon the Canon of Logarithmic Sines and
                    Tangents, and so carry on both works at once.</p>
                <p part="N">Soon after this, Adrian Vlacq or Flack of Gouda, in Holland, completed
                    the intermediate 70 chiliads, and republished the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic">Logarithmica</hi> in 1627 and 1628, with
                    these intermediate numbers, making in all the logarithms of all numbers to
                    100,000, but only to 10 places of figures. To these was added a table of
                    artificial sines, tangents, and secants, to every minute of the quadrant.</p>
                <p part="N">Briggs himself lived also to complete a table of logarithmic sines and
                    tangents, to the 100th part of every degree to fourteen places of figures,

                    fifteen places, and the tangents and secants of the same to ten places, with the
                    construction of the whole. But death prevented him from completing the
                    application and uses of them. However, when dying, he committed this to his
                    friend Henry Gellibrand, who accordingly added a preface, and the application of
                    the logarithms to plane and spherical trigonometry. The work was called <hi

                    ascertained, and the labour of constructing the table accomplished, succeeding
                    writers on the subject have had little more to do than to give the tables in the
                    most convenient form. It is true, that in consequence of the numerous
                    discoveries which were afterwards made in mathematics, particularly in the
                    doctrine of series, great improvements were made in the method of computing
                    logarithms; but these, for the most part, came too late to be of use in the
                    actual construction of the tables, although they might be applied with advantage
                    to verify calculations ^previously performed by methods much more laborious, and

                    esteemed the most correct; but, in the fifth edition, the errors are so

                <p part="N">There are various smaller sets of tables; but probably the most accurate
                    of all are those which Professor Babbage has produced with his very ingenious
                    calculating machine, which has enabled him to detect a variety of errors in
                    former tables. But, what is rather amusing, on examining a set of tables printed
                    in the Chinese character, and which, like every Chinese invention, were older
                    than the deluge, Mr Babbage found they contained precisely the same errors as
                    those of Vlacq did; thus proving, as had long been suspected, from what source
                    those original inventors had derived their logarithms.</p>

                    beginning of the French revolution. This enterprise was committed in 1794 to the
                    care of Baron de Prony, a mathematician of great eminence, who was <hi

                <p part="N">II.—NATURE OF LOGARITHMS, AND THEIR CONSTRUCTION.</p>
                <p part="N">We have already shown that the properties of logarithms are deducible
                    from those of two series, the terms of one of which form a geometrical
                    progression, and those of the other an arithmetical progression; and as this
                    manner of treating the subject is simple, it is perhaps the best adapted of any
                    to such of our readers as have not pursued the study of mathematics to any great
                    extent. We shall now show how, from the same principles, the logarithm of any
                    proposed number may be found, as was done by the earlier computers, though it is
                    far from affording the easiest mode of forming a table.</p>
                <p part="N">The first step to be taken in constructing a system of logarithms is to
                    assume the logarithm of some determinate number, besides that of unity or 1,
                    which must necessarily be 0. From the particular view which Napier first took of
                    the subject, he was led to assume unity for the logarithm of the number
                    2∙718282, by which it happened that the logarithm of 10 was 2·302585; and this
                    assumption being made, the form of the system became determinate, and the
                    logarithm of every number fixed to one particular value.</p>
                <p part="N">It was, however, soon observed, that it would be better to assume unity
                    for the logarithm of 10, instead of making it the logarithm of 2∙718282, as in
                    Napier’s first system; and hence the logarithms of the terms of the geometrical
                    progression</p>
                <p part="N">1, 10, 100, 1000, 10,000, &amp;c. were necessarily fixed to the
                    corresponding terms of this arithmetical progression,</p>
                <p part="N">0, 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206896?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6896-0421"/>
                <p part="N">That is, the logarithm of 1 being 0, and that of 10 being 1, the
                    logarithm of 100 is 2, that of 1000 is 3, and so on.</p>
                <p part="N">The logarithms of the terms of the progression 1, 10, 100, 1000, &amp;c.
                    being thus determined; in order to form the logarithms of the numbers between 1
                    and 10, and between 10 and 100, and so on, we must conceive a very great number
                    of geometrical means to be interposed between each two adjoining terms of the
                    preceding geometrical series, and as many arithmetical means between the
                    corresponding terms of the arithmetical series; then, like as the terms of the
                    arithmetical series 0, 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. are the logarithms of the corresponding
                    terms of the geometrical series 1, 10, 100, 1000, &amp;c. the interpolated terms
                    of the former will also be the logarithms of the corresponding interpolated
                    terms of the latter. Now, by supposing the number of means interposed between
                    each two terms of the geometrical series to be sufficiently great, some one or
                    other of them may be found which will be very nearly equal to any proposed
                    number. Hence, to find the logarithm of such a number, we have only to seek for
                    one of the interpolated means which is very nearly equal to it, and to take the
                    logarithm of that mean as a near value of the logarithm required.</p>
                <p part="N">As a particular example, let it be required to find the logarithm of 5,
                    according to Briggs’s system.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">First step of the process.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >—</hi> The number 5 is between 1 and 10, the logarithms of which we already
                    know to be 0 and 1: Let a geometrical mean be found between the two former, and
                    an arithmetical mean between the two latter. The geometrical mean will be the
                    square root of the product of the numbers 1 and 10, which is 3∙162277; and the
                    arithmetical mean will be half the sum of the logarithms 0 and 1, which is 0∙5;
                    therefore the logarithm of 3∙162277 is 0∙5. But as the mean thus found is not
                    sufficiently near the proposed number, we must proceed with the operation as
                    follows:</p>

                    geometrical mean between the two former, and an arithmetical mean between the
                    two latter. The one of these is √(3∙162277 X 10) = 5∙623413, and the other is

                    together with their logarithms 0∙5 and 0∙75; we therefore, proceeding as before,
                    find the geometrical mean, or √(3∙ 162277 X 5∙623413), to be 4∙216964, and the

                    new geometrical mean, viz. 4∙869674, and the corresponding arithmetical mean or
                    logarithm 0∙6875.</p>
                <p part="N">We must go on in this way till we have found twenty-two geometrical

                </table>
                <p part="N">As the last of these means, viz. Z, agrees with 5, the proposed number,
                    as far at least as the sixth place of decimals, we may safely consider them as
                    very nearly equal, and therefore their logarithms very nearly equal; that is,
                    the logarithm of 5 will be 0∙6989700 nearly.</p>
                <p part="N">In performing the operations indicated in the preceding table, it is
                    necessary to find the geometrical means at the beginning to many more figures
                    than are here put down, in order to insure at last a result true to 7 decimal
                    places. Thus it appears that the labour of computing logarithms by this method
                    is indeed very great. It is, however, that which was employed by Briggs and
                    Vlacq in the original construction of logarithms; but since their time more easy
                    methods have been found, some of which we shall presently have occasion to
                    explain; and a still easier method by Sir John Leslie will be found at the end
                    of this article.</p>
                <p part="N">The logarithm of any number whatever may be found by a series of
                    calculations similar to that just explained. But in constructing the table it
                    would only be necessary to have recourse to this method in calculating the
                    logarithms of prime numbers; for as often as the logarithm of a number which was
                    the product of other numbers, whose logarithms were known, was required, it
                    would be immediately obtained by adding together the logarithms of its factors.
                    On the contrary, if the logarithm of the product of two numbers were known, and
                    also that of one of its factors, the logarithm of the other factor would be
                    obtained from these, by simply taking their difference.</p>
                <p part="N">From this last remark it is obvious, that having now found the logarithm
                    of 5, we can immediately find that of 2; for since 2 is the quotient of 10
                    divided by 5, its logarithm will be the difference of the logarithms of 10 and
                    5; now the logarithm of 10 is 1, and that of 5 is 0∙6989700, therefore the
                    logarithm of 2 is 0∙3010300.</p>
                <p part="N">FIaving thus obtained the logarithms of 2 and 5, in addition to those of
                    10, 100,1000, &amp;c. we may thence find the logarithms of innumerable other
                    numbers. Thus, because 4 = 2×2, the logarithm of 4 will be the logarithm of 2
                    added to itself, or will be twice the logarithm of 2. Again, because 5 X 10 =
                    50, the logarithm of 50 will be the sum of the logarithms of 5 and 10. In this
                    manner it is evident we may find the logarithms of 8 =2 × 4, of 16 = 2 X 8, of
                    2o = 5 X 5, and of as many more such numbers as we please.</p>
                <p part="N">Besides the view we have hitherto taken of the theory of logarithms,
                    there are others under which it has been presented by different authors. Some of
                    these we proceed to explain, beginning with that in which they are defined to be
                    the <hi rend="italic">measures of ratios</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but to see
                    the propriety of this definition, it must be understood what is meant by the
                    measure of a ratio.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206909?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6909-0422"/>
                <p part="N">According to the usual definition of a compound ratio, if there be any
                    number of magnitudes A, B, C, D, in continued proportion, the ratio of the
                    first, A, to the third, C, is considered as made up of two ratios, each equal
                    the ratio of the first, A, to the second, B. And in like manner the ratio of the
                    first, A, to the fourth, D, is considered as made of three ratios, each equal
                    the same ratio of the first to the second, and so on. Thus, to take a particular
                    example in numbers, because the ratio of 81 to 3 may be considered as made up of
                    the ratio of 81 to 27, and of 27 to 9, and of 9 to 3, which three ratios are
                    equal among themselves, the ratio of 81 to 3 will be triple that of 9 to 3; and
                    in like manner the ratio of 27 to 3 will be double that of 9 to 3. Also, because
                    the ratios of 1000 to 100, 100 to 10, 10 to 1, are all equal, the ratio of 1000
                    to 1 will be three times as great as that of 10 to 1; and the ratio of 100 to 1
                    will be twice as great; and so on.</p>
                <p part="N">Taking this view of ratios, and considering them as a particular species
                    of quantities, made up of others of the same kind, they may evidently be
                    compared with each other in the same manner as we compare lines or quantities of
                    any kind whatever. And as, when estimating the relative magnitude of two
                    quantities, two lines, for example, if the one contains five such equal parts as
                    the other contains seven, we say the one line has to the other the proportion of
                    5 to 7; so, in like manner, if two ratios be such, that the* one can be resolved
                    into five equal ratios, and the other into seven of the same ratios, we may
                    conclude that the magnitude of the one ratio is to that of the other as the
                    number 5 to the number 7; and a similar conclusion may be drawn, when the ratios
                    to be compared are any multiples whatever of some other ratio.</p>
                <p part="N">Since lines and other quantities, which admit of no common measure, are
                    said to be incommensurable to each other, the same will obviously happen to
                    ratios; that is, there may be two ratios such, that into whatever number of
                    equal ratios the one is divided, the other cannot possibly be exactly equal to a
                    ratio composed of any integral number of these. We may, however, conceive the
                    number of equal ratios into which the one is divided to be so great, that a
                    certain number of them shall compose a ratio more nearly equal to the other
                    ratio than by any assignable difference. Therefore, like as we can always find
                    numbers which shall have among themselves, either accurately, or as nearly as we
                    please, the same ratios as lines or other magnitudes have to each other, and
                    which therefore may be taken as the measures or representatives of the lines; so
                    also, corresponding to any system of ratios, there may be always found a series
                    of numbers which will have the same proportions among themselves as the ratios
                    have to each other, and which may in like manner be called the <hi rend="italic"
                        >measures of the ratios.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Let us now suppose that unity, or 1, is assumed as the common consequent
                    or second term of all ratios whatever; and that the ratio of 10 (or some
                    particular number) to 1 is compounded of a very great number of equal ratios,
                    as, for example, 1,000,000: then, as each of these will be very near the ratio
                    of equality (for it will be the ratio of the first term to the second of a
                    series consisting of one million and one continued proportionals, the first of
                    which is 10 and last 1), it will follow, and is easy to conceive, that the
                    ratios of all other numbers to unity will each be very nearly equal to some
                    multiple of that small ratio. And by supposing the number of small equal ratios
                    of which the ratio of 10 to 1 is composed, to be sufficiently great, the ratios
                    of all other numbers to unity may be as nearly equal to ratios which are
                    multiples of that small ratio, as we please. Let us still suppose, however, for
                    the sake of illustration, that the number of small ratios contained in that of
                    10 to 1 is 1,000,000; then, as it may be proved that the ratio of 2 to 1 will be
                    very nearly the same as a ratio composed of 301,030 of these, and that the ratio
                    of 3 to 1 will be nearly equal to a ratio composed of 477,121 of them, and that
                    the ratio of 4 to 1 will be nearly equal to a ratio composed of 602,060 of them,
                    and so on; these numbers, viz. 1,000,000, 301,030, 477,121, and 602,060, or any
                    other numbers proportional to them, will be the <hi rend="italic">measures</hi>
                    of the ratios of 10 to 1, 2 to 1, 3 to 1, and 4 to 1, respectively; and the same
                    quantities will also be what have been called the <hi rend="italic"
                        >logarithms</hi> of the ratios; for the word <hi rend="italic"
                        >logarithm,</hi> if regard be had to its etymology, is <hi rend="italic"
                        >∖οyο&gt;ν αp0μοι,</hi> or the numbers of small and equal ratios (or <hi
                        rend="italic">rati-unculae,</hi> as they have been called) contained in the
                    several ratios of quantities one to another.</p>
                <p part="N">We have, for the sake of illustration, assumed 1,000,000 as the measure
                    of the ratio of 10 to 1, by which it Happens, as already observed, that the
                    measures of the ratios of 2 to 1, 3 to 1, &amp;c. are 301,030 and 477,121
                    respectively; as, however, these measures are not absolute, but relative
                    quantities, we may assume any other numbers whatever instead of these, provided
                    they are proportional to them. Accordingly, we may assume 1 as the measure or
                    logarithm of the ratio of 10 to I; and then the logarithms of the ratios of 2 to
                    1, 3 to 1, &amp;c. instead of being 301,030, 477,121, &amp;c. will be ∙301030
                    and ∙477121, &amp;c. respectively, that is, each will be one millionth of what
                    it was be fore.</p>
                <p part="N">In Briggs’s system, the logarithm of the ratio of 10 to 1, or, to speak
                    briefly, the logarithm of 10, is unity; but we are at liberty to assume any
                    number whatever, as that whose logarithm shall be unity. Napier, in consequence
                    of his particular views, chose 2,718,282; and hence it happens that the

                <p part="N">But, to show the identity of the properties of logarithms, as explained
                    in the two different views now given of the subject, let A and B denote any two
                    numbers. The ratio of their product to unity, that is, the ratio of A × B to 1,
                    is compounded of the ratio of A to 1 and of B to 1; and consequently the
                    logarithm of the ratio of A × B to 1 will equal the sum of the logarithms of the
                    ratios of A to 1, and of B to 1; or, in other words, the logarithm of A × B will
                    be the sum of the logarithms of A and B. Now, log. (A X B) = log. A + log. B,
                    therefore, log. B = log. (A X B)</p>

                <p part="N">Such is a short sketch of the theory of logarithms as deducible from the
                    doctrine of ratios. It was in this way that the celebrated Kepler treated the
                    subject; and he has been followed by Mercator, Halley, and Cotes, as well as by
                    mathematicians of later times, as by Baron Maseres in his Trigonometry. The same
                    mode was likewise adopted in the posthumous works of Dr Robert Simson. As,
                    however, the doctrine of ratios is very abstract, and the mode of reasoning upon
                    which it has been established is of a peculiar and subtile kind, we presume that
                    the greater number of readers will think this view of the subject less simple
                    and natural than the following, in which we mean to deduce the theory of
                    logarithms, as well as the manner of computing them, from the properties of the
                    exponents of powers.</p>

                    exhibiting the logarithms of all numbers within certain limits may be applied to
                    simplify calculations; for since the sum of the logarithms of any two numbers is
                    the logarithm of their product, it follows, that as often as we have occasion to
                    find the product of two or more numbers, we have only to add their logarithms
                    taken from the table into one sum, and to look for the number whose logarithm is
                    equal to that sum, and this number will be the product required. Also, because
                    the difference between the logarithm of the dividend and that of the divisor is
                    the loga rithm of the quotient, whenever we have occasion to divide one number
                    by another, we have only to subtract the logarithm of the divisor from that of
                    the dividend, and opposite to that logarithm in the table, which is the
                    remainder, we find the quotient.</p>
                <p part="N">As the logarithm of any power of a number is the product of the

                    logarithm of the number by the index of the root; it follows that we may find
                    any power or root of a number by multiplying the logarithm of the number by the
                    index of the power, or dividing it by the index of the root, and taking that

                    would be the most convenient of any in practice; and accordingly such a system

                    was still more considerable; as, for example, 199, the series would converge so

                <p part="N">It may be proper here briefly to notice some new views on the doctrine
                    of logarithms, which havς <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> been advanced at
                    considerable length by Mr Graves in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                        Transactions</hi> for 1829. The discovery made by Poisson and Poinsot, in
                    their researches on angular sections, of errors in trigonometrical formulae
                    usually deemed complete, drew Mr Graves’s attention to what he considered
                    analogous defects in logarithmic series. He accordingly professes, in the paper
                    cited, to exhibit in an amended form two fundamental developments, especially
                    that of the one we have given above of the equation <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">= r</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> x</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >;</hi> but the new formulae are unfortunately exhibited in such an abstruse
                    and indefinite form, as to be quite unintelligible to most readers, and our
                    limits will not admit of introducing them here with a sufficient explanation.
                    The chief objection made to the ordinary series is, that it only gives one value
                    to <hi rend="italic">y</hi> for each value of <hi rend="italic">x;</hi> whereas,
                    when a? is a rational fraction in its lowest terms, <hi rend="italic">y</hi>
                    should have as many values of some sort as there are units in the denominator of
                        <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> Thus, when <hi rend="italic">χ</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">—</hi> ½ and <hi rend="italic">r</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    10, the value of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> being et= √10, maybe— 3∙162277 as well
                    as + 3∙162277; but it is surely never meant that <hi rend="italic">y</hi> should
                    ever have more than two possible values, or indeed more than one such value,
                    when the denominator of <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> is odd.</p>
                <p part="N">Mr Graves considers the principles employed in this inquiry as
                    presenting a solution of many difficulties, and illustrating peculiarities in
                    the theory of logarithms of negative quantities; and, when applied to geometry,
                    as furnishing the means of tracing the form and developing the properties of
                    curves whose equations involve exponential quantities. He also states that, by
                    their means, various differential and other formulae usually exhibited in
                    treatises on logarithms may be rendered complete. He combats the opinion that
                    equations which are numerically false may yet be analytically true; and explains
                    the difficulty by reverting to the limitations inherent in the hypothesis on
                    which the developments are founded. In opposition to John Bernoulli and
                    D’Alembert, he maintains that the logarithms of negative numbers are not in
                    general the same as those of positive ones; and hence infers that negative
                    numbers have occasionally even real logarithms. But several objectionable things
                    in Mr Graves’s paper have been pointed out by Mr Peacock, in an able article on
                    analysis in the Third Report of the British Association, page 266; and, indeed,
                    until Mr Graves chooses to put his new views in a more definite and intelligible
                    shape, and to express himself in ordinary mathematical language, we suspect his
                    speculations are not likely to meet with a favourable reception.</p>

                    solution generally proposed, however ingenious and refined, are often too
                    complex for ordinary purposes. We shall therefore point out a procedure of
                    extreme simplicity and most ready application. It will embrace any system of
                    numbers, but seems peculiarly fitted for the computation of logarithms.</p>
                <p part="N">Napier first published in 1614 his canon <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mirificus</hi><hi rend="italic">Logarithmorum,</hi> comprised in a very
                    thin and small quarto volume, exhibiting, as far as seven places, the logarithms
                    only of the sines and tangents to every minute of the quadrant; those of the
                    ordinary numbers being left to be deduced from the nearest sines or tangents. In
                    the summer following, Briggs, then professor of geometry in Gresham College at
                    London, who was enchanted by that noble discovery, paid a visit to its
                    illustrious author at Merchiston, in the vicinity of Edinburgh. During an
                    agreeable stay of a month, it was concerted between them to change the natural
                    system of logarithms into another of a more artificial form, but adapted to our
                    denary scale of notation, the labour of the calculation, however, being devolved
                    upon Briggs, as younger, and enjoying robust health. Next season, Briggs
                    performed a second journey to Edinburgh, and showed to Napier a table which he
                    had computed of the new logarithms for the first chiliad or thousand of the
                    series of natural numbers. But the great inventor was now fast declining in
                    years, and expired on the 3d of April 1618. Briggs, employing most skilfully all
                    the abbreviations which ingenuity could devise, prosecuted his most arduous task
                    with such vigour and active perseverance, as to compute, in the space of seven
                    years, to fourteen places of figures, not only the logarithms of the sines and
                    tangents of every degree and centesimal minute of the quadrant, but also the
                    logarithms of thirty chiliads of numbers. These tables were printed in 1624, in
                    a folio volume, entitled <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Lοgarithmica.</hi> In his anxiety, however, to bring out this stupendous
                    work, Briggs contented himself with calculating the logarithms from unit to
                    20,000, and from 90,000 to 100,000, leaving the computation of the seventy
                    intervening chiliads to be afterwards supplied. The very ingenious author
                    annexed a full explanation of his mode of framingthe tables, grounded chiefly on
                    the consideration of differences, and he thus traced the first steps of that
                    important theory. But he likewise gave instructions for the readier filling up
                    of the intermediate logarithms, abridging the toil of calculation no doubt, yet
                    detailing a procedure sufficiently irksome and complicated. “To encourage some
                    skilful persons to perform this task, he offered to furnish them with paper he
                    had by him, ready prepared, and divided into columns proper for that purpose, as
                    likewise to inform them at what part to begin, that they might not interfere one
                    with another; and promised, when the whole was finished, to endeavour to procure
                    a new edition of the work so completed.” This slender boon seems not to have
                    tempted the mathematicians in England. In Holland, however, Adrian Vlacq,
                    chancing to meet two years afterwards with a copy of the work, and, prompted
                    only by his patriotic zeal, had the resolution to revise and compute the whole
                    canon, reducing it from fourteen to ten places of figures, which he printed in
                    folio at Gouda, as early as 1628. The same able calculator, only five years
                    afterwards, published, likewise in folio, at Gouda, a very extensive system of
                    logarithmic sines and tangents, to every ten seconds of the quadrant, having
                    restored the sexagesimal subdivision, which Briggs had partly changed into a
                    centesimal one. These two volumes may be deemed a precious <hi rend="italic"
                        >thesaurus</hi> of logarithms, from which succeeding compilers have drawn
                    very liberally. They form the basis of the <hi rend="italic">Tables</hi>
                    published by Vega at Leipsic in 1794, which, till lately, were the best and
                    completest extant.</p>
                <p part="N">But though the <hi rend="italic">1 aοles</hi> of Vlacq, carried only to
                    ten places of figures, are sufficiently accurate for every ordinary purpose, and
                    even for the most delicate calculations in astronomy, yet many persons have
                    often regretted that the original system of Briggs was never completed. The
                    celebrated Legendre has employed that table, imperfect as it is, in some of his
                    most refined numerical investigations. It is well known that Mr Baron Maseres
                    devoted a considerable portion of his time and of his fortune to the.
                    republication of the works of the early writers on logarithms. In the course of
                    this extensive undertaking, he entertained some thoughts of giving a new edition
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic">Logarithmica,</hi>
                    and expressed an earnest wish that the vacant chiliads were filled up. To
                    promote the liberal designs of the baron, the author of this article was induced
                    to bestow some reflection on the subject, and a very simple mode occurred to
                    him, which would have reduced the labour of computing those logarithms to little
                    more than the trouble of mere transcription. But the object of completing the
                    canon was deferred for a time, and afterwards gradually forgotten. The method of
                    interpolation then proposed seems, however, to deserve notice on account of its
                    great simplicity, and its ready application, not only to the immediate object,
                    but to other questions of a similar nature. We shall, therefore, now state the
                    principle, and illustrate its application by a few examples.</p>

                    then, any table of logarithms is carried to double its actual extent through all
                    the odd numbers, those of the even ones being found by the mere addition of the

                    thereby rouse the attention and notice of the understanding. By reflecting, too,
                    on what passes within us, we become sensible of the operations of our own minds,

                    being furnished with ideas, contrives to diversify and enlarge its stock; we
                    have here chiefly to consider the means of making known our thoughts to others,
                    that we may not only understand how knowledge is acquired, but also in what
                    manner it may be communicated with the greatest certainty and advantage.</p>
                <p part="N">1. <hi rend="italic">Of Words, considered as the Signs of
                    Ideas.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">1. The ideas of which we are conscious, though manifold and various, are
                    nevertheless of themselves unknown to others. But God, designing us for society,
                    has provided us with organs fitted to frame articulate sounds, and given us also
                    a capacity of using those sounds as the signs of internal conceptions. Hence
                    spring words and language; for, having once pitched upon any sound to stand as
                    the mark or sign of an idea in the mind, custom by degrees establishes such a
                    connection between them, that the appearance of the idea in the understanding
                    suggests to our remembrance the sound or name by which it is expressed; as, in
                    like manner, the hearing of the sound excites the idea which it represents. And
                    thus it is easy to conceive how a man may record his own thoughts, and bring
                    them again into view in any succeeding period of life; for this connection being
                    once settled, as the same sounds will always serve to excite the same ideas, if
                    he can but contrive to register his words in the order and disposition in which
                    the actual train of his thoughts presents itself to his imagination, it is
                    evident that he will be able to recall these thoughts at pleasure, and that too
                    in the very manner of their first appearance. Accordingly we find, that the
                    inventions of writing and printing, by enabling us to fix and perpetuate such
                    perishable things as sounds, have also furnished us with the means of giving a
                    kind of permanence to the transactions of the mind, insomuch that they may
                    thereby be subjected to our review like any other objects of nature.</p>
                <p part="N">2. But besides the capacity of recording our thoughts, external signs
                    also enable us to communicate our thoughts to <hi rend="italic">others,</hi> and
                    to receive information of what passes in <hi rend="italic">their</hi> minds. For
                    any number of men, having agreed to establish the same sounds as signs of the
                    same ideas, it is apparent that the repetition of these sounds must suggest
                    similar ideas in each, and thus tend to create a perfect correspondence of
                    thoughts. When, for instance, any train of ideas succeed one another in the
                    mind, if the names by which we are wont to express them have been annexed by
                    those with whom we converse to the same order of ideas, nothing is more evident,
                    than that, by repeating those names according to the tenor of our actual
                    conceptions, we shall raise in their minds a similar train of thought. For, by
                    barely attending to what passes within themselves upon hearing the sounds which
                    we repeat, they will also be made aware of the ideas in our understanding. So
                    that we here clearly perceive how a man may communicate his sentiments,
                    knowledge, and discoveries to others, if the language in which he converses be
                    extensive enough to mark all the ideas and operations of his mind. But as this
                    is not always the case, and men are often obliged to invent terms of their own
                    to express new views and conceptions of things, it may be asked, how, in these
                    circumstances, we can become acquainted with the thoughts of another, when he
                    makes use of words with which we have never associated ideas? In order to unveil
                    this mystery, and afford some insight into the foundation, progress, and
                    improvement of language, the following observations are deserving of
                    attention.</p>
                <p part="N">3. First, it is evident that no word can be to any man the sign of an
                    idea, unless that idea comes to have a real existence in his mind. For names,
                    being only so far intelligible as they denote known internal conceptions; where
                    they have none such answering to them, they are plainly sounds without
                    signification, and of course they convey no instruction or knowledge. But no
                    sooner are the ideas to which they belong raised in the understanding, than,
                    finding it easy to connect them with the established names, we can join in any
                    agreement of this kind established by others, and thereby enjoy the benefit of
                    their discoveries. The first thing therefore to be considered is, how these
                    ideas may be conveyed into the mind; that being there, we may learn to connect
                    them with their appropriate sounds, and so become capable of understanding
                    others when they make use of these sounds in communicating their thoughts. Now,
                    to comprehend this distinctly, it is necessary to attend to the division of our
                    ideas into <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> and <hi rend="italic">complex</hi> (see
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics).</hi> And, firstly, as to our simple
                    ideas, they can find no admission into the mind, except by the two original
                    portals of knowledge, <hi rend="italic">sensation</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >reflection.</hi> If therefore any of these have as yet no being in the
                    understanding, it is impossible by words or description to excite them there. A
                    man who had never felt the sensation of <hi rend="italic">heat,</hi> could not
                    be brought to comprehend that sensation by any thing which we might say to
                    explain it. If we would really produce the idea in him, it must be by applying
                    the proper object to his senses, and bringing him within the influence of a
                    heated body. When this is done, and experience has taught him the sensation to
                    which men have annexed the name of <hi rend="italic">heat,</hi> it then becomes
                    to him the sign of that idea, and he thenceforth understands the meaning of the
                    term, which, before, all the words in the world would not have been sufficient
                    to convey into his mind. The case is the same in respect of light and colours. A
                    man born blind, and thereby deprived of the only means of acquiring the ideas of
                    this class, can never be brought to understand the names by which they are
                    expressed. The reason is obvious. They stand for ideas which have no existence
                    in his mind; and as the organ appropriated to their reception is wanting, all
                    other contrivances are vain, nor can they by any description be suggested to his
                    imagination. But it is quite otherwise in the case of complex notions; for these
                    being no more than certain combinations of simple ideas, put together in various
                    forms, if the original ideas out of which the combinations are made have already
                    obtained admission into the understanding, and the names serving to express them
                    are knownj it will be easy, by enumerating the several ideas concerned in the
                    composition, and marking the order and manner in which they are united, to raise
                    any complex conception in the mind. Thus the idea answering to the word <hi
                        rend="italic">rainbow</hi> may be readily excited in the imagination of
                    another who has never seen the appearance itself, by barely describing the
                    figure, size, position, and order of colours, if we suppose that these several
                    simple ideas, with their names, are sufficiently known to him.</p>
                <p part="N">4. And this leads to a second observation upon this subject, namely,
                    that words standing for complex ideas are all <hi rend="italic">definable,</hi>
                    whereas those by which we denote simple ideas are not; for simple ideas being a
                    sort of secondary perceptions, which have no other entrance into the mind than
                    by sensation or reflection, can only be obtained by experience, from the several
                    objects of nature which are proper to produce in us those perceptions. Words
                    indeed may very well serve to remind us of them, if they have already found
                    admission into the understanding, and their connection with the established
                    names be known; but they can never give them their original being and existence
                    there. And hence it is, that when anyone asks the meaning of a word denoting a
                    simple idea, we pretend not to explain it to him by a definition, well knowing
                    that to be impossible; but, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207078?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-7078-0435"/>supposing him already acquainted with the
                    idea, and only ignorant of the name by which it is called, we either mention it
                    to him by some other name with which we presume he knows its connection, or
                    appeal to the object from which the idea itself is derived. Thus, were any one
                    to ask the meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">τohite,</hi> we should tell him
                    it stood for the same idea as <hi rend="italic">albus</hi> in Latin, or <hi
                        rend="italic">blanc</hi> in French; or, if we thought him a stranger to
                    these languages, we might appeal to an object producing the idea, by saying that
                    it denotes the colour which we observe in <hi rend="italic">snow or milk.</hi>
                    But this is by no means a definition of the word, exciting a new idea in his
                    understanding; it is merely a contrivance to remind him of a known idea, and
                    teach him its connection with the established name. For if the ideas after which
                    he inquires have never yet been raised in his mind, as suppose one who had seen
                    no other colours than <hi rend="italic">black</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >white,</hi> should ask the meaning of the word <hi rend="italic"
                        >scarlet,</hi> it is easy to perceive, that it would be no more possible to
                    make him comprehend it by words, or by a definition, than to introduce the same
                    perception into the imagination of a man born blind. The only method in this
                    case is, to present some object, by looking at which the perception itself may
                    be excited; and thus he will learn both the name and the idea together.</p>
                <p part="N">5. But how comes it to pass that men agree in the names of their simple
                    ideas, seeing they cannot ascertain the perceptions in one another’s minds, nor
                    by words make known these perceptions to others? The effect is produced by
                    experience and observation. Thus finding, for instance, that the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">heat</hi> is annexed to that sensation which men feel when
                    they approach the fire, we make it also the sign of the sensation excited in us
                    by such an approach, nor have we any doubt that it denotes the same perception
                    in our mind as in theirs. For we are naturally led to imagine, that the same
                    objects operate alike upon the organs of the human body, and produce an
                    uniformity of sensations. No man fancies that the idea raised in him by the
                    taste of <hi rend="italic">sugar,</hi> and which he calls <hi rend="italic"
                        >sweetness,</hi> differs from that excited in another by the same object; or
                    that <hi rend="italic">wormwood,</hi> to the relish of which he has applied the
                    epithet <hi rend="italic">bitter,</hi> produces in another the sensation which
                    he denotes by the word <hi rend="italic">sweet.</hi> Presuming therefore upon
                    this conformity of perceptions, when they arise from the same objects, we easily
                    agree as to the names of our simple ideas; and if at any time, by a more narrow
                    scrutiny into things, new ideas of this class should come in our way, which we
                    may chuse to express by terms of our own invention, these names are explained,
                    not by a definition, but by referring to the objects whence the ideas themselves
                    have been obtained.</p>
                <p part="N">6. Being in this manner furnished with simple ideas, and the names by
                    which they are expressed, the meaning of the terms which stand for complex ideas
                    is easily got at, because the ideas themselves answering to these terms may be
                    conveyed into the mind by definitions; for our complex notions are only certain
                    combinations of simple ideas. When, therefore, these are enumerated, and the
                    manner in which they are united into one conception explained, nothing more is
                    wanting to raise that conception in the understanding; and thus the term
                    denoting it comes of course to be understood. But here it is worth while to
                    reflect a little upon the wise contrivance of nature, in thus furnishing us with
                    the aptest means of communicating our thoughts to others. For were it not so
                    ordered, that we could thus by definitions convey our complex ideas from one to
                    another, it would in many cases be impossible to make them known at all. This is
                    apparent in those ideas which are the proper work of the mind itself; for as
                    they exist only in the understanding, and have no real objects in nature in
                    conformity to which they are framed, if we could not make them known by
                    description, they would for ever lie hid within our own breasts, and be confined
                    to the narrow acquaintance of a single mind. All the fine scenes which arise
                    from time to time in the poet’s fancy, and by his lively painting give such
                    entertainment to his readers, were he destitute of this faculty of laying them
                    open to the view of others by words and description, could not extend their
                    influence beyond his own imagination, or give pleasure to any one but the
                    original inventor.</p>
                <p part="N">7. There is this further advantage in the ability we enjoy of
                    communicating our complex notions by definitions, that as these constitute by
                    far the largest class of our ideas, and most frequently occur in the progress
                    and improvement of knowledge, so they are by this means imparted with the
                    greatest readiness, than which nothing can tend more to the increase and
                    diffusion of science; for a definition is soon pursued, and if the terms of it
                    are well understood, the idea itself findsan easy admission into the mind. But,
                    in simple perceptions, where we are referred to the objects producing them, if
                    these cannot be come at, as is sometimes the case, the names by which they are
                    expressed must remain empty sounds. As new ideas of this class, however, occur
                    but rarely in the sciences, they seldom create any great obstruction. Yet it is
                    otherwise with our complex notions; for, every step we take leading us into new
                    combinations and views of things, it becomes necessary to explain these to
                    others, before they can be made acquainted with our discoveries; and as the
                    manner of definitions is easy, requiring no apparatus but that of words, which
                    are always ready at hand, we can hence with less difficulty remove such
                    obstacles as might arise from terms of our o wn invention, when these are made
                    to stand for new complex ideas suggested to the mind by some actual train of
                    thinking. And thus at last we are let into the mystery hinted at in the
                    beginning of this chapter, viz. how we may become acquainted with the thoughts
                    of another, when he makes use of words to which we have as yet joined no ideas.
                    From what has already been said, the answer is obvious. If the terms denote
                    simple perceptions, he must refer us to those objects of nature whence the
                    perceptions themselves are to be obtained; but if they stand for complex ideas,
                    their meaning may be explained by a <hi rend="italic">definition.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">2. Of Definition.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">1. A <hi rend="smallcaps">definition</hi><hi rend="italic">is the
                        development and determination of some conception of the mind, answering to
                        the word or term made use of as its sign.</hi> Now as, in exhibiting any
                    idea to another, it is necessary that the description be such as may excite that
                    precise idea in his mind, it is plain that definitions, properly speaking, are
                    not arbitrary, but confined to the representing of certain determinate settled
                    notions, such, namely, as are annexed by the speaker or writer to the words he
                    employs. As nevertheless it is universally allowed that the signification of
                    words is perfectly voluntary, and not the effect of any natural and necessary
                    connection between them and the ideas for which they stand, some may perhaps
                    wonder why definitions are not so likewise. In order, therefore, to unravel this
                    difficulty, and show distinctly what is and what is not arbitrary in speech, we
                    must carefully distinguish between the connection of our words and ideas, and
                    the unfolding of the ideas themselves.</p>
                <p part="N">2. First, as to the connection of words and ideas; this, it is evident,
                    is purely an arbitrary institution. When, for instance, we have in our minds the
                    idea of any particular species of metals, the calling it by the name <hi
                        rend="italic">gold</hi> is an effect'θf the voluntary choice of men speaking
                    the same language, and not of any peculiar aptness in that sound to express that
                    idea. Other nations we find make use of different sounds, and with the same
                    effect. Thus <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207091?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-7091-0436"/><hi rend="italic">aurum</hi> denotes the same
                    idea in Latin, and <hi rend="italic">or</hi> in French; and even the word <hi
                        rend="italic">gold</hi> itself would have as well served to express the idea
                    of that metal which we call <hi rend="italic">silver,</hi> had custom in the
                    beginning so established it.</p>
                <p part="N">3. But although we are thus entirely at liberty to connect any idea with
                    any sound, yet it is quite otherwise in unfolding the ideas themselves; for
                    every idea having a precise appearance of its own, by which it is distinguished
                    from every other idea, it is manifest, that in laying it open to others, we must
                    study such a description as shall exhibit that peculiar appearance. When we have
                    formed to ourselves the idea of a figure bounded by four equal sides, joined
                    together at right angles, we are at liberty to express that idea by any sound,
                    and call it either a <hi rend="italic">square</hi> or a <hi rend="italic"
                        >triangle.</hi> But whichever of these names we use, so long as the idea is
                    the same, the description by which we would signify it to another must likewise
                    remain so. Let it be called <hi rend="italic">square</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >triangle,</hi> it is still a figure having four equal sides, and all its
                    angles right ones. Hence we clearly see what is and what is not arbitrary in the
                    use of words. The establishing any sound as the mark of some determinate idea in
                    the mind, is the effect of free choice, and of a voluntary combination amongst
                    men; and as different nations make use of different sounds to denote the same
                    ideas, hence proceed all that variety of languages which we meet with in the
                    world. But when a connection between our ideas and words is once settled, the
                    unfolding of the idea answering to any word, which properly constitutes a
                    definition, is by no means an arbitrary thing. In this case we are bound to
                    exhibit the precise conception which either the use of language, or our own
                    particular choice, has annexed to the term we employ.</p>
                <p part="N">4. And thus it appears, that definitions, considered as descriptions of
                    ideas in the mind, are steady and invariable, being confined to the
                    representation of those precise ideas. But then, in the application of
                    definitions to particular names, we are altogether left to our own free choice;
                    because, as the connecting of any idea with any sound is a perfectly arbitrary
                    institution, the applying the description of that idea to that sound must be so
                    likewise. When, therefore, logicians tell us that the definition of the name is
                    arbitrary, they mean no more than this, That as different ideas may be connected
                    with any term, according to the pleasure of him who employs it, in like manner
                    may different descriptions be applied to the term, suitable to the ideas so
                    connected. But this connection being settled, and the term considered as the
                    sign of some fixed idea in the understanding, we are no longer left to arbitrary
                    explanations, but must study such a description as corresponds with that precise
                    idea. Now, this alone, according to what has been before laid down, ought to be
                    accounted a definition. What seems to have occasioned no small confusion in this
                    matter, is, that many explanations of words, where no idea is unfolded, but the
                    connection between some word and idea is merely asserted, have yet been
                    dignified with the name of definitions. Thus, when we say that <hi rend="italic"
                        >a clock is an instrument by which we measure time,</hi> that is by some
                    called a definition; and yet it is plain that we are beforehand supposed to have
                    an idea of this instrument, and only taught that the word <hi rend="italic"
                        >clock</hi> serves in common language to denote that idea. By this rule all
                    explanations of words in our dictionaries would be definitions, nay, the names
                    of even simple ideas might be thus described. <hi rend="italic">White,</hi> we
                    may say, is the colour we observe in snow or milk; <hi rend="italic">head,</hi>
                    the sensation produced by approaching the fire; and so in innumerable other
                    instances. But these, and all others of a similar kind, are by no means
                    definitions, exciting new ideas in the understanding, but merely contrivances to
                    remind us of known ideas, and to teach their connection with the established
                    names. .</p>
                <p part="N">5. But, in definitions properly so called, we have first to consider the
                    term we use as the sign of some inward conception, either annexed to it by
                    custom, or by our own free choice; and then the business of the definition is to
                    unfold and explicate that idea. As therefore the whole art consists in giving
                    just and true copies of our ideas, a definition is said to be made perfect, when
                    it serves distinctly to excite the idea described in the mind of another, even
                    supposing him to have been previously unacquainted with it. This point being
                    settled, then, let us next inquire what those ideas are which are capable of
                    being thus unfolded. And, in the first place, it is evident that all our simple
                    ideas are necessarily excluded. We have already seen that experience alone is to
                    be consulted here, insomuch that if either the objects whence they are derived
                    come not in our way, or the avenues appointed by nature for their reception are
                    wanting, no description can be sufficient to convey them into the mind. But
                    where the understanding is already supplied with these original and primitive
                    conceptions, as they may be united together in an infinity of different forms,
                    so may all their several combinations <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> be distinctly
                    laid open, by enumerating the simple ideas concerned in the various
                    combinations, and tracing the order and manner in which they are linked together
                    in composition. Now these combinations of simple notices constitute what we call
                    complex notions; whence it is evident, that complex ideas, and these alone,
                    admit of that kind of description which goes by the name of definition.</p>
                <p part="N">6. Definitions, then, are pictures or representations of our idea?; and
                    as these representations are only possible when the ideas themselves are
                    complex, it is obvious to remark, that definitions cannot have place, except
                    where we make use of terms standing for such complex ideas. But our complex
                    ideas being, as we have said, nothing more than different combinations of simple
                    ideas, we know and comprehend them perfectly, when we know the several simple
                    ideas of which they consist, and can so put them together in our minds as may be
                    necessary towards the framing of that peculiar connection which gives every idea
                    its distinct and proper appearance.</p>
                <p part="N">7. Two things are therefore required in every definition. The first is,
                    that all the original ideas, but of which the complex one is formed, be
                    distinctly enumerated; and the second is, that the order and manner of combining
                    them into one conception be clearly explained. Where a definition has these
                    requisites, nothing is wanting to its perfection; because every one who reads it
                    and understands the terms, seeing at once what ideas he is to join together, and
                    also in what manner, can at pleasure form in his own mind the complex conception
                    answering to the term defined. Let us, for instance, suppose the word <hi
                        rend="italic">square</hi> to stand for that idea by which we represent to
                    ourselves a figure whose sides subtend quadrants of a circumscribed circle. The
                    parts of this idea are the sides bounding the figure. These must be four in
                    number, and all equal amongst themselves, because they are each to subtend a
                    fourth part of the same circle. But, besides these component parts, we must also
                    take notice of the manner of putting them together, if we would exhibit the
                    precise idea for which the word <hi rend="italic">square</hi> here stands; for,
                    four equal right lines, anyhow joined, will not subtend quadrants of a
                    circumscribed circle. A figure with this property must have its sides standing
                    also at right angles. Taking in this last consideration, therefore, respecting
                    the manner of combining the parts, the idea is fully described, and the
                    definition thereby rendered complete; for a figure bounded by four equal sides,
                    joined together at right angles, has the property required, and is moreover the
                    only right-lined figure to which that property belongs.</p>
                <p part="N">8. It will now be obvious to every one in what manner we ought to
                    proceed, in order to arrive at just and adequate definitions. First, we are to
                    take an exact view ofthe<pb break="no" facs="nls:193207104?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-7104-0437"/> idea to be described; trace it to its
                    original principles; and mark the several simple perceptions which enter into
                    the composition of it. Secondly, we are to consider the particular manner in
                    which these elementary ideas are combined, in order to form that precise
                    conception for which the term we make use of stands. When this is done, and the
                    idea is wholly unravelled, we have nothing more to do than fairly to transcribe
                    the appearance it makes to our own minds. Such a description, by distinctly
                    exhibiting the order and number of our primitive conceptions, cannot fail to
                    excite, at the same time, in the mind of every one who reads it, the complex
                    idea resulting from them; and therefore it attains the true and proper end of a
                    definition.</p>
                <p part="N">3. <hi rend="italic">Of the Composition and Resolutions of our Ideas,
                        and the Rules of Definition thence arising.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">1. The rule laid down in the foregoing chapter is general, extending to
                    all possible cases, and is indeed that to which alone we can have recourse where
                    any doubt or difficulty may arise. It is not, however, necessary that we should
                    practise it in every particular instance. Many of our ideas are extremely
                    complicated, insomuch that to enumerate all the simple perceptions out of which
                    they are formed would be a very troublesome and tedious task. For this reason
                    logicians have established certain compendious rules of defining, which it may
                    not be amiss here to give some account of. But in order to the better
                    understanding of what follows, it will be necessary to keep in view, that there
                    is a certain gradation in the composition of our ideas. The mind of man is very
                    limited in its apprehension, and cannot take in a great number of objects at
                    once. We are therefore obliged to proceed gradually, and make our first advances
                    subservient to those which follow. Thus, in forming our complex notions, wc
                    begin at first with but a few simple ideas, such as we can manage with case, and
                    unite together into one conception. When wc are provided with a sufficient stock
                    of these, and have by habit and use rendered them familiar to our minds, they
                    become the component parts of other ideas still more complicated, and form what
                    may be called a second order of compound notions. This process, it is evident,
                    may be continued to any degree of composition we please, mounting from one stage
                    to another, and enlarging, as we ascend, the number of combinations.</p>
                <p part="N">2. But, in a scries of this kind, whosoever would make himself perfectly
                    acquainted with the last and highest order of ideas, must find it expedient to
                    proceed gradually through all the intermediate steps. For, were he to take any
                    very composite idea to pieces, and, without regard to the several classes of
                    simple perceptions which have already been formed into distinct combinations,
                    break it down at once into its original elements, the number would be so great
                    as perfectly to confound the imagination, and overcome the Utmost reach and
                    capacity of the mind. When we observe a prodigious multitude of men huddled
                    together in crowds, without order or any regular position, we find it impossible
                    to arrive at an exact knowledge of their number. But if they are formed into
                    separate battalions, and so stationed as to fall within the leisurely survey of
                    the eye, by viewing them successively and in order, we may <hi rend="subscript">
                        t</hi> come to an easy and certain determination. It is the same in regard
                    to complex ideas. When the original perceptions out of which they are framed are
                    very numerous, it is not enough that we take a view of them in loose and
                    scattered bodies; wc must form them into dis tinct classes, and unite these
                    classes in a just and orderly manner, before wc can arrive at a true knowledge
                    of the compound notions resulting from them.</p>
                <p part="N">3. This gradual progress of the mind to its composite notions, through a
                    variety of intermediate steps, plainly points out the manner of conducting the
                    definitions by which these notions may be conveyed into the minds of others;
                    for, as the series commences with simple and easy combinations, and advances
                    through a succession of different orders, rising one above another in the degree
                    of composition, it is evident that, in a. train of definitions expressing these
                    ideas, a similar gradation is to be observed. Thus the complex ideas of the
                    lowest order can no otherwise be described than by enumerating the simple ideas
                    out of which they are formed, and explaining the manner of their union. But, in
                    th’c second, or any other succeeding order, as they are formed out of those
                    gradual combinations, it is not necessary, in describing them, to mention one by
                    one all the simple ideas of which they are composed. They may be more distinctly
                    and briefly unfolded by enumerating the compound ideas of a lower order, of
                    whose union they are the result, and which are all supposed to be already known
                    in consequence of previous definitions. Here then it is that the logical method
                    of definition takes place; which, that it may be the better understood, wc shall
                    explain somewhat more particularly the several steps and gradations of the mind
                    in compounding its ideas, and thence deduce that peculiar form of definition
                    which logicians have thought proper to establish.</p>
                <p part="N">4. All the ideas we receive from the several objects of nature that
                    surround us represent distinct individuals; and these individuals, when compared
                    together, arc found in certain particulars to resemble each other. Hence, by
                    collecting the resembling particulars into one conception, we form the notion of
                    a <hi rend="italic">species.</hi> And here let it be observed, that this last
                    idea is less complicated than that by which we represent any of the particular
                    objects contained under it; for the idea of the species excludes the
                    peculiarities of the several individuals, and embraces such properties only as
                    are common to all. Again, by comparing several species together, and observing
                    their resemblance, we form the idea of a <hi rend="italic">genus;</hi> where, in
                    the same manner as before, the composition is lessened, because we leave out
                    what is peculiar to the several species compared, and retain only the
                    particulars in which they agree. It is easy to conceive the mind proceeding thus
                    from one step to another, and advancing through several classes of general
                    notions, until at last it arrives at the highest genus of all, denoted by the
                    word <hi rend="italic">being,</hi> where the idea of existence alone is
                    concerned.</p>
                <p part="N">5. In this procedure we observe the mind unravelling a complex idea, and
                    tracing it in the ascending scale, from greater or less degrees of composition,
                    until it terminates in one simple perception. But if we take the series the
                    contrary way, and, beginning with the last or highest genus, carry our view
                    downwards, through all the inferior genera and species, to the individuals, we
                    shall thereby arrive at a distinct apprehension of the conduct of the
                    understanding in the composition of its ideas; for, in the several classes of
                    our perceptions, the highest in the scale is for the most part that which is
                    made up of but a few simple ideas, such as the mind can take in and survey with
                    ease. This first general notion, when branched out into the different
                    subdivisions contained under it, has in every one of them something peculiar, by
                    which they are distinguished amongst themselves; insomuch that, in descending
                    from the genus to the species, we always superadd some new idea, and thereby
                    increase the degree of composition. Thus the idea denoted by the word <hi
                        rend="italic">figure</hi> is of a very general nature, and composed of but
                    few simple perceptions, as implying no more than space everywhere bounded. But
                    if we descend further, and consider the boundaries of this space, as that they
                    may be either lines or surface, we shall fall into the several species of
                    figure. For where the space is bounded by one or more surfaces, we <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193207117?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7117-0438"
                        /><hi rend="italic">mutable truths.</hi> If it be true that tlιe whole is
                    equal to all its parts, it must be so unchangeably; because the relation of
                    equality, being attached to the ideas themselves, must ever intervene where the
                    same ideas are compared. Of this nature are all the truths of natural religion,
                    morality, and mathematics, and, in general, whatever may be gathered from the
                    bare view and consideration of our ideas.</p>
                <p part="N">4. The second ground ofhuman judgment is Experience; from which we are
                    led to infer the existence of those objects that surround us, and fall under the
                    immediate notice of our senses. When we see the sun, or cast our eyes towards a
                    building, we not only have perceptions of these objects within ourselves, but
                    ascribe to them a real existence independent of the percipient mind. It is also
                    by the information of the senses that we judge of the qualities of bodies; as
                    when we say that “snow is white, fire hot, or steel hard.” For as we are wholly
                    unacquainted with the internal structure and constitution of the bodies which
                    produce these sensations in us, and are unable to trace any connection between
                    that structure and the sensations themselves, it is evident that we build our
                    judgments altogether upon observation, ascribing to bodies such qualities as are
                    answerable to the perceptions which they excite in us. Not that we ever suppose
                    the qualities of bodies to be things of the same nature with our perceptions;
                    for there is nothing in fire similar to the sensation of heat, or in a sword
                    similar to that of pain; but when different bodies excite in our minds similar
                    perceptions, we necessarily ascribe to these bodies, not only an existence
                    independent of us, but likewise similar qualities, of which it is the nature to
                    produce similar perceptions in the human mind. But this is not the only
                    advantage derived from experience; for to that too we are indebted for all our
                    knowledge regarding the co-existence of sensible qualities in objects, and the
                    operations of bodies one upon another. Ivory, for instance, is hard and elastic;
                    this we know by experience, and indeed by experience alone. For, being
                    altogether strangers to the true nature both of elasticity and hardness, we
                    cannot by the bare contemplation of our ideas determine how far the one
                    necessarily implies the other, or whether there may not be a repugnance between
                    them. But when we observe that both exist in the same object, we are then
                    assured from experience that they are not incompatible; and when we also find
                    that a stone is hard and not elastic, and that air though elastic is not hard,
                    we likewise conclude upon the same foundation that the ideas are not necessarily
                    conjoined, but may exist separately in different objects. In like manner, with
                    regard to the operations of bodies upon one another, it is evident that our
                    knowledge this way is all derived from observation. <hi rend="italic">Aqua
                        regia</hi> dissolves gold, as has been found by frequent trial, nor is there
                    any other way of arriving at the discovery. Naturalists may tell us, if they
                    please, that the parts of <hi rend="italic">aqua regia</hi> are of a texture apt
                    to insinuate between the corpuscles of gold, and thereby loosen and burst them
                    asunder. If this be a true account of the matter, it will notwithstanding be
                    allowed that our conjecture in regard to the conformation of these bodies is
                    deduced from the experiment, and not the experiment from the conjecture. It was
                    not from any previous knowledge of the intimate structure of <hi rend="italic"
                        >aqua regia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gold,</hi> and the aptness of their
                    parts to act or to be acted upon, that we came by the conclusion above
                    mentioned. The internal constitution of bodies is in a manner wholly unknown to
                    us; and could we even surmount this difficulty, yet, as the separation of the
                    parts of gold implies something like an active force in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >menstruum,</hi> and we are unable to conceive how the latter comes to be
                    possessed of this activity, the effect must be owned to be altogether beyond our
                    comprehension. But when repeat ed trials had once confirmed it, insomuch that it
                    was admitted as an established truth in natural knowledge, it then became easy
                    for men to spin out theories of their own invention, and contrive such a
                    structure of parts, both for <hi rend="italic">gold</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >aqua regia,</hi> as would best serve to explain the phenomenon upon the
                    principles of that system of philosophy, whatever it might be, which they had
                    adopted.</p>
                <p part="N">5. From what has been said, it is evident that as intuition is the
                    foundation of what we call <hi rend="italic">scientific,</hi> so experience is
                    the foundation of what we call <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> knowledge. For
                    this last being wholly concerned with objects of sense, or those bodies that
                    constitute the natural world, and their properties, as far as we can discover
                    them, being to be traced only by a long and painful series of observations, it
                    is apparent, that, in order to improve this branch of knowledge, we must betake
                    ourselves to the method of trial and experiment.</p>
                <p part="N">6. But though experience is what we may term the immediate foundation of
                    natural knowledge, yet with respect to particular persons its influence is very
                    narrow and confined. The bodies that surround us are numerous, many of them lie
                    at a great distance, and some are quite beyond our reach. Life is so short, and
                    so crowded with cares, that but little time is left for any single man to employ
                    himself in unfolding the mysteries of nature. Hence it is necessary to admit
                    many things upon the testimony of others, which by this means becomes the
                    foundation of a great part of our knowledge of body. No man doubts of the power
                    of <hi rend="italic">aqua regia</hi> to dissolve gold, though perhaps he never
                    himself made the experiment. In these, therefore, and such like cases, we judge
                    of the facts and operations of nature upon the mere ground of testimony.
                    However, as we can always have recourse to experiment where any doubt or scruple
                    arises, this is justly considered as the true foundation of natural philosophy,
                    being indeed the ultimate support upon which our assent rests, and to which we
                    appeal when the highest degree of evidence is required.</p>
                <p part="N">7. But there are many facts which do not admit of an appeal to the
                    senses; and in this case testimony is the true and only foundation of our
                    judgments. All human actions, ot whatever kind, when considered as already past,
                    are of the nature here described; because having now no longer any existence,
                    both the facts themselves, and the circumstances attending them, can be known
                    only from the relations of those who had sufficient opportunities of arriving at
                    the truth. <hi rend="italic">Testimony,</hi> therefore, is justly accounted a
                    third ground of human judgment; and as from the other two we have deduced <hi
                        rend="italic">scientific</hi> and <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> knowledge,
                    so we may from this derive <hi rend="italic">historical,</hi> by which we mean,
                    not merely a knowledge of the civil transactions of states and kingdoms, but of
                    all facts whatsoever, where testimony is the ultimate foundation of our
                    belief.</p>
                <p part="N">2. <hi rend="italic">Of Affirmative and Negative Propositions.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">1. Whilst the comparing of our ideas is considered merely as an act of
                    the mind, assembling them together, and joining or disjoining them according to
                    the result of its perceptions, we call it <hi rend="italic">judgment</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> but when our judgments are put into words, they then
                    bear the name of <hi rend="italic">propositions.</hi> A proposition, therefore,
                    is a sentence expressing some judgment of the mind, by which two or more ideas
                    are affirmed to agree or disagree. Now, as our judgments include at least two
                    ideas, one of which is affirmed or denied of the other, so must a proposition
                    have terms answering to these ideas. The idea of which we affirm or deny, and of
                    course the term expressing that idea, is called the <hi rend="italic"
                        >subject</hi> of the proposition. The idea affirmed or denied, as also the
                    term answering it, is called the <hi rend="italic">predicate.</hi> Thus, in the
                    proposition, “God is omnipotent,” <hi rend="italic">God</hi> is the subject, it
                    being of him that we affirm omnipotence, and <hi rend="italic">οrn∙</hi><pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193207130?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7130-0439"
                        /><hi rend="italic">tapotent</hi> is the predicate, because we affirm that
                    the idea expressed by that word belongs to God.</p>
                <p part="N">2. But as in propositions ideas are either joi⅜ιed or disjoined, it is
                    not enough to have terms expressing those ideas, unless we have also some words
                    to denote their agreement or disagreement. That word in a proposition which
                    connects two ideas together, is called the <hi rend="italic">copula</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> and if a negative particle be annexed, we thereby
                    understand that the ideas are disjoined. The <hi rend="italic">substantive
                        verb</hi> is commonly made use of for the copula, as in the above-mentioned
                    proposition, “God is omnipotent,” where <hi rend="italic">is</hi> represents the
                    copula, and signifies the agreement of the ideas of <hi rend="italic">God</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">omnipotence.</hi> But if we mean to separate two ideas,
                    then, besides the substantive verb, we must also use some particle of negation
                    to express this repugnance. The proposition, “Man is not perfect,” may serve as
                    an example of this kind; for here the notion of <hi rend="italic"
                        >perfection</hi> being removed from the idea of <hi rend="italic">man,</hi>
                    the negative particle <hi rend="italic">not</hi> is inserted after the copula,
                    to signify the disagreement between the subject and the predicate.</p>
                <p part="N">3. Every proposition necessarily consists of these three parts, but then
                    it is not alike needful that they be all severally expressed in words; because
                    the copula is often included in the term of the predicate, as when we say
                    “Hesits,” which imports the sameas “He is sitting.” In the Latin language a
                    single word has often the force of a whole sentence. Thus <hi rend="italic"
                        >ambulat</hi> is the same as <hi rend="italic">ille est ambulans</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">αrιιο,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">ego
                        sum</hi><hi rend="italic">amans;</hi> and so in innumerable other instances,
                    by which it appears that we are not so much to regard the number of words in a
                    sentence, as the ideas which they represent, and the manner in which they are’
                    put together. For wherever two ideas are joined or disjoined in an expression,
                    though of but a single word, it is evident that we have a subject, predicate,
                    and copula, and of consequence a complete proposition.</p>
                <p part="N">4. When the mind joins two ideas, we call it an <hi rend="italic"
                        >affirmative</hi> judgment; when it separates them, a <hi rend="italic"
                        >negative</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and as any two ideas compared
                    together must necessarily either agree or not agree, it is evident that all our
                    judgments fall under these two divisions. Hence, likewise, the propositions
                    expressing these judgments are all either affirmative or negative. An
                    affirmative proposition connects the predicate with the subject, as, “A stone is
                    heavy ;” a negative proposition separates them, as “God is not the author of
                    evil.” <hi rend="italic">Affirmation,</hi> therefore, is the same as joining two
                    ideas together; and this is effected by means of the copula. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Negation,</hi> on the contrary, marks the repugnance between the ideas
                    compared, in which case a negative particle must be called in to show that the
                    connection included in the copula does not take place.</p>
                <p part="N">5. Hence we see the reason of the rule commonly laid down by logicians,
                    That in all negative propositions the negation ought to affect the copula. For
                    as the copula, when placed by itself between the subject and the predicate,
                    manifestly binds them together, it is evident, that in order to render a
                    proposition negative, the particles of negation must enter it in such a manner
                    as to destroy this union. In a word, two ideas are only disjoined in a
                    proposition when the negative particle may be so referred to the copula as to
                    break the affirmation included in it, and undo that connection it would
                    otherwise establish. When we say, for instance, “No man is perfect,” take away
                    the negation, and the copula of itself plainly unites the ideas in the
                    proposition. But as this is the very reverse of what is intended, a negative
                    mark is added, to show that this union does not take place here. The negation,
                    therefore, by destroying the effect of the copula, changes the very nature of
                    the proposition, insomuch that, instead of binding two ideas together, it
                    denotes their separation. On the contrary, in this sentence, “The man who
                    departs not from an upright behaviour is beloved of God,” the predicate <hi
                        rend="italic">beloved of God is</hi> evidently affirmed of the subject an
                        <hi rend="italic">tipright man</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> so that,
                    notwithstanding the negative particle, the proposition is still affirmative. The
                    reason is plain. The negation here affects not the copula, but, constituting
                    properly a part of the subject, serves, with other terms in the sentence, to
                    form one complex idea, of which the predicate <hi rend="italic">beloved of
                        God</hi> is directly affirmed.</p>
                <p part="N">3. <hi rend="italic">Of Universal and Particular Propositions.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">1. The next considerable division of propositions is that into <hi
                        rend="italic">universal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">particular.</hi> Our
                    ideas, according to what has been already observed, are all singular as they
                    enter the mind, and represent individual objects. But as by abstraction we can
                    render them universal, so as to comprehend a whole class of things, and
                    sometimes several classes at once, hence the terms expressing these ideas must
                    be in like manner universal. If, therefore, we suppose any general term to
                    become the subject of a proposition, it is evident, that whatever is affirmed of
                    the abstract idea belonging to that term, may be affirmed of all the individuals
                    to which that idea extends. Thus, when we say, “Men are mortal,” we consider
                    mortality, not as confined to one or any number of particular men, but as what
                    may be affirmed without restriction of the whole species. By this means the
                    proposition becomes as general as the idea which forms the subject of it, and
                    indeed derives its universality entirely from that idea, being more or less so
                    according as this may be extended to more or fewer individuals. But it is
                    further to be observed of these general terms, that they sometimes enter a
                    proposition in their full latitude, as in the example above given, and sometimes
                    appear with a mark of limitation. In this last case we are given to understand
                    that the predicate agrees not to the whole universal idea, but only to a part of
                    it; as in the proposition, “Some men are wise.” Here wisdom is not affirmed of
                    every particular ' man, but is restricted to a few of the human species.<note

                            preceding note, where it is demonstrated that the <hi rend="italic"

                            reality <hi rend="italic">general.</hi> The term <hi rend="italic"
                                >man</hi> is equally applicable to every individual of the human
                            race; and therefore, what is affirmed or denied of <hi rend="italic"
                                >men</hi> in general, is affirmed or denied of all the individuals,
                            without regard to their discriminating qualities. <hi rend="italic"

                                >man,</hi> limits the signification of that <hi rend="italic"
                                >general term</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and therefore what is
                            affirmed of <hi rend="italic">some men,</hi> is affirmed only of <hi
                                rend="italic">part</hi> of the race, but that part itself is not
                            ascertained.</p></note></p>
                <p part="N">2. Now, from this different appearance of the general idea which
                    constitutes the subject of any judgment, arises the division of propositions
                    into <hi rend="italic">universal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">particular.</hi> An
                    universal proposition is that in which the subject is some general term taken in
                    its full latitude, insomuch that the predicate agrees to all the individuals
                    comprehended under it if it denotes a proper species, and to all the several
                    species and their individuals if it marks an idea of a higher order. The words
                        <hi rend="italic">all, every, no, none,</hi> &amp;c. are the proper signs of
                    this universality; and as they seldom fail to accompany general truths, so they
                    form the most obvious criterion by which to distinguish them. “All animals have
                    a power of beginning motion.” This is an universal proposition, as we know from
                    the word <hi rend="italic">all</hi> prefixed to the subject <hi rend="italic"
                        >animals,</hi> which denotes that it must be taken in its full extent. Hence
                    the power of beginning motion may be affirmed of all the different species of
                    animals.</p>
                <p part="N">3. A <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> proposition has in like manner
                    some general term for its subject, but with a mark of limitation added, to
                    denote that the predicate agrees only to some of the individuals comprehended
                    under a species, or to one <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207143?mode=fullsize"

                    be true that the whole is equal to all its parts, it must be so unchangeably;
                    because the relation of equality, being attached to the ideas themselves, must
                    ever intervene where the same ideas are compared. Of this nature are all the
                    truths of natural religion, morality, and mathematics, and, in general, whatever
                    may be gathered from the bare view and consideration of our ideas.</p>
                <p part="N">4. The second ground of human judgment is Experience; from which we are
                    led to infer the existence of those objects that surround us, and fall under the
                    immediate notice of our senses. W <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> hen we see the
                    sun, or cast our eyes towards a building, we not only have perceptions of these
                    objects within ourselves, but ascribe to them a real existence independent of
                    the percipient mind. It is also by the information of the senses that we judge
                    of the qualities of bodies; as when we say that “snow is white, fire hot, or
                    steel hard.” For as we are wholly unacquainted with the internal structure and
                    constitution of the bodies which produce these sensations in us, and are unable
                    to trace any connection between that structure and the sensations themselves, it
                    is evident that we build our judgments altogether upon observation, ascribing to
                    bodies such qualities as are answerable to the perceptions which they excite in
                    us. Not that we ever suppose the qualities of bodies to be things of the same
                    nature with our perceptions; for there is nothing in fire similar to the
                    sensation of heat, or in a sword similar to that of pain; but when different
                    bodies excite in our minds similar perceptions, we necessarily ascribe to these
                    bodies, not only an existence independent of us, but likewise similar qualities,
                    of which it is the nature to produce similar perceptions in the human mind. But
                    this is not the only advantage dé-rived from experience; for to that too we are
                    indebted for all our knowledge regarding the co-existence of sensible qualities
                    in objects, and the operations of bodies one upon another. Ivory, for instance,
                    is hard and elastic; this we know by experience, and indeed by experience alone.
                    For, being altogether strangers to the true nature both of elasticity and
                    hardness, we cannot by the bare contemplation of our ideas determine how far the
                    one necessarily implies the other, or whether there may not be a repugnance
                    between them. But when we observe that both exist in the same object, we are
                    then assured from experience that they are not incompatible; and when we also
                    find that a stone is hard and not elastic, and that air though elastic is not
                    hard, we likewise conclude upon the same foundation that the ideas are not
                    necessarily conjoined, but may exist separately in different objects. In like
                    manner, with regard to the operations of bodies upon one another, it is evident
                    that our knowledge this way is all derived from observation. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Aqua regia</hi> dissolves gold, as has been found by frequent trial, nor is
                    there any other way of arriving at the discovery. Naturalists may tell us, if
                    they please, that the parts of <hi rend="italic">aqua regia</hi> are of a
                    texture apt to insinuate between the corpuscles of gold, and thereby loosen and
                    burst them asunder. If this be a true account of the matter, it will
                    notwithstanding be allowed that our conjecture in regard to the conformation of
                    these bodies is deduced from the experiment, and not the experiment from the
                    conjecture. It was not from any previous knowledge of the intimate structure of
                        <hi rend="italic">aqua regia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gold,</hi> and the
                    aptness of their parts to act or to be acted upon, that we came by the
                    conclusion above mentioned. The internal constitution of bodies is in a manner
                    wholly unknown to us; and could we even surmount this difficulty, yet, as the
                    separation of the parts of gold implies something like an active force in the
                        <hi rend="italic">menstruum,</hi> and we are unable to conceive how the
                    latter comes to be possessed of this activity, the effect must be owned to be
                    altogether beyond our comprehension. But when repeat ed trials had once
                    confirmed it, insomuch that it was admitted as an established truth in natural
                    knowledge, it then became easy for men to spin out theories of their own
                    invention, and contrive such a structure of parts, both for <hi rend="italic"
                        >gold</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aqua regia,</hi> as would best serve to
                    explain the phenomenon upon the principles of that system of philosophy,
                    whatever it might be, which they had adopted.</p>
                <p part="N">5. From what has been said, it is evident that as intui- <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi> tion is the foundation of what we call <hi
                        rend="italic">scientific,</hi> so experience is the foundation of what we
                    call <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> knowledge. For this last being wholly
                    concerned with objects of sense, or those bodies that constitute the natural
                    world, and their properties, as far as we can discover them, being to be traced
                    only by a long and painful series of observations, it is apparent, that, in
                    order to improve this branch of knowledge, we must betake ourselves to the
                    method of trial and experiment.</p>
                <p part="N">6. But though experience is what we may term the immediate foundation of
                    natural knowledge, yet with respect to particular persons its influence is very
                    narrow and confined. The bodies that surround us are numerous, many of them lie
                    at a great distance, and some are quite beyond our reach. Life is so short, and
                    so crowded with cares, that but little time is left for any single man to employ
                    himself in unfolding the mysteries of nature. Hence it is necessary to admit
                    many things upon the testimony of others, which by this means becomes the
                    foundation of a great part of our knowledge of body. No man doubts of the power
                    of <hi rend="italic">aqua regia</hi> to dissolve gold, though perhaps he never
                    himself made the experiment. In these, therefore, and such like cases, we judge
                    of the facts and operations of nature upon the mere ground of testimony.
                    However, as we can always have recourse to experiment where any doubt or scruple
                    arises, this is justly considered as the true foundation of natural philosophy,
                    being indeed the ultimate support upon which our assent rests, and to which wc
                    appeal when the highest degree of evidence is required.</p>
                <p part="N">7. But there are many facts which do not admit of an appeal to the
                    senses; and in this case testimony is the true and only foundation of our
                    judgments. All human actions, of whatever kind, when considered as already past,
                    are of the nature here described; because having now no longer any existence,
                    both the facts themselves, and the circumstances attending them, can be known
                    only from the relations of those who had sufficient opportunities of arriving at
                    the truth. <hi rend="italic">Testimony,</hi> therefore, is justly accounted a
                    third ground of human judgment; and as from the other two we have deduced <hi
                        rend="italic">scientific</hi> and <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> knowledge,
                    so we may from this derive <hi rend="italic">historical,</hi> by which we mean,
                    not merely a knowledge of the civil transactions of states and kingdoms, but of
                    all facts whatsoever, where testimony is the ultimate foundation of our
                    belief.</p>
                <p part="N">2. <hi rend="italic">Of Affirmative and Negative Propositions.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">1. Whilst the comparing of our ideas is considered merely as an act of
                    the mind, assembling them together, and joining or disjoining them according to
                    the result of its perceptions, we call it <hi rend="italic">judgment</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> but when our judgments are put into words, they then
                    bear the name of <hi rend="italic">propositions.</hi> A proposition, therefore,
                    is a sentence expressing some judgment of the mind, by which two or more ideas
                    are affirmed to agree or disagree. Now, as our judgments include at least two
                    ideas, one of which is affirmed or denied of the other, so must a proposition
                    have terms answering to these ideas. The idea of which we affirm or deny, and of
                    course the term expressing that idea, is called the <hi rend="italic"
                        >subject</hi> of the proposition. The idea affirmed or denied, as also the
                    term answering it, is called the <hi rend="italic">predicate.</hi> Thus, in the
                    proposition, “God is omnipotent,” <hi rend="italic">God</hi> is the subject, it
                    being of him that we affirm omnipotence, and <hi rend="italic">οrn-</hi><pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193207156?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7156-0441"
                        /><hi rend="italic">mpotent</hi> is the predicate, because we affirm that
                    the idea expressed by that word belongs to God.</p>
                <p part="N">2. But as in propositions ideas are either joined or disjoined, it is
                    not enough to have terms expressing those ideas, unless we have also some words
                    to denote their agreement or disagreement. That word in a proposition which
                    connects two ideas together, is called the <hi rend="italic">copula</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> and if a negative particle be annexed, we thereby
                    understand that the ideas are disjoined. The <hi rend="italic">substantive
                        verb</hi> is commonly made use of for the copula, as in the above-mentioned
                    proposition, “God is omnipotent,” where <hi rend="italic">is</hi> represents the
                    copula, and signifies the agreement of the ideas of <hi rend="italic">God</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">omnipotence.</hi> But if we mean to separate two ideas,
                    then, besides the substantive verb, we must also use some particle of negation
                    to express this repugnance. The proposition, “Man is not perfect,” may serve as
                    an example of this kind; for here the notion of <hi rend="italic"
                        >perfection</hi> being removed from the idea of <hi rend="italic">man,</hi>
                    the negative particle <hi rend="italic">not</hi> is inserted after the copula,
                    to signify the disagreement between the subject and the predicate.</p>
                <p part="N">3. Every proposition necessarily consists of these three parts, but then
                    it is not alike needful that they be all severally expressed in words; because
                    the copula is often included in the term of the predicate, as when we say “He
                    sits,” which imports the same as “He is sitting.” In the Latin language a single
                    word has often the force of a whole sentence. Thus <hi rend="italic"
                        >ambulαt</hi> is the same as <hi rend="italic">ille est ambulans</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">αrnο,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">ego
                        sum</hi><hi rend="italic">amans;</hi> and so in innumerable other instances,
                    by which it appears that we are not so much to regard the number of words in a
                    sentence, as the ideas which they represent, and the manner in which they are’
                    put together. For wherever two ideas are joined or disjoined in an expression,
                    though of but a single word, it is evident that we have a subject, predicate,
                    and copula, and of consequence a complete proposition.</p>
                <p part="N">4. When the mind joins two ideas, we call it an α½⅛≡- <hi rend="italic"
                        >twe</hi> judgment; when it separates them, a <hi rend="italic"
                        >negative</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and as any two ideas compared
                    together must necessarily either agree or not agree, it is evident that all our
                    judgments fall under these two divisions. Hence, likewise, the propositions
                    expressing these judgments are all either affirmative or negative. An
                    affirmative proposition connects the predicate with the subject, as, “A stone is
                    heavy a negative proposition separates them, as “God is not the author of evil.”
                        <hi rend="italic">Affirmation,</hi> therefore, is the same as joining two
                    ideas together; and this is effected by means of the copula. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Negation,</hi> on the contrary, marks the repugnance between the ideas
                    compared, in which case a negative particle must be called in to show that the
                    connection included in the copula does not take place.</p>
                <p part="N">5. Hence we see the reason of the rule commonly laid down by logicians,
                    That in all negative propositions the negation ought to affect the copula. For
                    as the copula, when placed by itself between the subject and the predicate,
                    manifestly binds them together, it is evident, that in order to render a
                    proposition negative, the particles of negation must enter it in such a manner
                    as to destroy this union. In a word, two ideas are only disjoined in a
                    proposition when the negative particle may be so referred to the copula as to
                    break the affirmation included in it, and undo that connection it would
                    otherwise establish. When we say, for instance, “No man is perfect,” take away
                    the negation, and the copula of itself plainly unites the ideas in the
                    proposition. But as this is the very reverse of what is intended, a negative
                    mark is added, to show that this union does not take place here. The negation,
                    therefore, by destroying the effect of the copula, changes the very nature of
                    the proposition, insomuch that, instead of binding two ideas together, it
                    denotes their separation. On the contrary, in this sentence, “The man who
                    departs not from an upright behaviour is beloved of God,” the predicate <hi
                        rend="italic">beloved of God</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >s&gt;</hi> evidently affirmed of the subject an <hi rend="italic">upright
                        man</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> so that, notwithstanding the negative
                    particle, the proposition is still affirmative. The reason is plain. The
                    negation here affects not the copula, but, constituting properly a part of the
                    subject, serves, with other terms in the sentence, to form one complex idea, of
                    which the predicate <hi rend="italic">beloved of God</hi> is directly
                    affirmed.</p>
                <p part="N">3. <hi rend="italic">Of Universal and Particular Propositions.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">1. The next considerable division of propositions is that into <hi
                        rend="italic">universal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">particular.</hi> Our
                    ideas, according to what has been already observed, are all singular as they
                    enter the mind, and represent individual objects. But as by abstraction we can
                    render them universal, so as to comprehend a whole class of things, and
                    sometimes several classes at once, hence the terms expressing these ideas must
                    be in like manner universal. If, therefore, we suppose any general term to
                    become the subject of a proposition, it is evident, that whatever is affirmed of
                    the abstract idea belonging to that term, may be affirmed of all the individuals
                    to which that idea extends. Thus, when we say, “Men are mortal,” we consider
                    mortality, not as confined to one or any number of particular men, but as what
                    may be affirmed without restriction of the whole species. By this means the
                    proposition becomes as general as the idea which forms the subject of it, and
                    indeed derives its universality entirely from that idea, being more or less so
                    according as this may be extended to more or fewer individuals. But it is
                    further to be observed of these general terms, that they sometimes enter a
                    proposition in their full latitude, as in the example above given, and sometimes
                    appear with a mark of limitation. In this last case we are given to understand
                    that the predicate agrees not to the whole universal idea, but only to a part of
                    it; as in the proposition, “Some men are wise.” Here wisdom is not affirmed of
                    every particular‘man, but is restricted to a few of the human species.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">See the
                            preceding note, where it is demonstrated that the <hi rend="italic"

                            reality <hi rend="italic">general.</hi> The term <hi rend="italic"
                                >man</hi> is equally applicable to every individual of the human
                            race; and therefore, what is affirmed or denied of <hi rend="italic"
                                >men</hi> in general, is affirmed or denied of all the individuals,
                            without regard to their discriminating qualities. .S’owze is a

                            to the word <hi rend="italic">man,</hi> limits the signification of that

                            therefore what is affirmed of <hi rend="italic">some men,</hi> is
                            affirmed only of <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of the race, but that part
                            itself is not ascertained.</p></note></p>
                <p part="N">2. Now, from this different appearance of the general idea which
                    constitutes the subject of any judgment, arises the division of propositions
                    into <hi rend="italic">universal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">particular.</hi> An
                    universal proposition is that in which the subject is some general term taken in
                    its full latitude, insomuch that the predicate agrees to all the individuals
                    comprehended under it if it denotes a proper species, and to all the several
                    species and their individuals if it marks an idea of a higher order. The words
                        <hi rend="italic">all, every, no, none,</hi> &amp;c. are the proper signs of
                    this universality; and as they seldom fail to accompany general truths, so they
                    form the most obvious criterion by which to distinguish them. “All animals have
                    a power of beginning motion.” This is an universal proposition, as we know from
                    the word <hi rend="italic">all</hi> prefixed to the subject <hi rend="italic"
                        >animals,</hi> which denotes that it must be taken in its full extent. Hence
                    the power of beginning motion may be affirmed of all the different species of
                    animals.</p>
                <p part="N">3. A <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> proposition has in like manner
                    some general term for its subject, but with a mark of limitation added, to
                    denote that the predicate agrees only to some of the individuals comprehended
                    under a species, or to one <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207169?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-7169-0442"/>or more of the species belonging to a genus,
                    and not to the entire universal idea. Thus, “Some stones are heavier than iron;”
                    “Some men have an uncommon share of prudence.” In the latter of these
                    propositions, the subject <hi rend="italic">some men</hi> implies only a certain
                    number of individuals, comprehended under a single species. In the former, where
                    the subject is a genus which extends to a great variety of distinct classes, <hi
                        rend="italic">some stones</hi> may not only imply any number of particular
                    stones, but also several whole species of stones, inasmuch as there may be not a
                    few with the property there described. Hence we see that a proposition does not
                    cease to be particular by the predicate’s agreeing to a whole species, unless
                    that species, singly and distinctly considered, forms also the subject of which
                    we affirm or deny.</p>
                <p part="N">4. There is still one species of propositions which remains to be
                    described, and which the more deserves our notice, as it is not yet agreed
                    amongst logicians to which of the two classes mentioned above they ought to be
                    referred; namely, <hi rend="italic">singular</hi> propositions, or those where
                    the subject is an individual. Of this nature are the following: “Sir Isaac
                    Newton was the inventor of fluxions “This book contains many useful truths.”
                    What occasions some difficulty as to the proper rank of these propositions is,
                    that the subject being taken according to the whole of its extension, they
                    sometimes have the same effect in reasoning as universals. But if it be
                    considered that they are in truth the most limited kind of particular
                    propositions, and that no proposition can with any propriety be called universal
                    butwhere the subject is some universal idea, we shall not find any difficulty in
                    determining to which class they ought to be referred. When we say, “Some books
                    contain useful truths,” the proposition is particular, because the general term
                    appears with a mark of restriction. If, therefore, we say, “This book contains
                    useful truths,” it is evident that the proposition must be still more
                    particular, as the limitation implied in the word <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is
                    of a more confined nature than in the former case.</p>
                <p part="N">5. We perceive, therefore, that all propositions are either <hi
                        rend="italic">affirmative</hi> or <hi rend="italic">negative</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> nor is it less evident that in both cases they maybe
                        <hi rend="italic">universal ox particular.</hi> Hence arises that celebrated
                    fourfold division of them into <hi rend="italic">universal affirmative</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">universal negative, particular affirmative</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">particular negative,</hi> which indeed comprehends all their
                    varieties. The use of this method of distinguishing them will appear more fully
                    afterwards, when we come to treat of reasoning and syllogism.</p>
                <p part="N">4. <hi rend="italic">Of Absolute and Conditional Propositions.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">1. The objects about which we are chiefly conversant in this world, are
                    all of a nature very liable to change. What may be affirmed of them at one time,
                    cannot often be affirmed at another; and one of the objects of our knowledge is
                    to enable us to distinguish rightly these variations, and trace the reasons upon
                    which they depend. For it is observable, that amidst all the vicissitudes of
                    nature, some things remain constant and invariable; nor are even the changes to
                    which we see others liable, effected, except in consequence of uniform and
                    steady laws, which, when known, are sufficient to direct us in our judgments
                    concerning them. Hence philosophers, in distinguishing the objects of our
                    perception into various classes, have been very careful to state, that some
                    properties belong so essentially to the general idea, as not to be separable
                    from it except by destroying its very nature; whilst others are only accidental,
                    and may be affirmed or denied of it in different circumstances. Thus solidity, a
                    yellow colour, and a great weight, are considered as essential qualities of
                    gold; but whether it shall exist as an uniform conjoined mass, is not alike
                    necessary. We find that by a proper menstruum it may be reduced to a very fine
                    powder, and that an intense heat will bring it into a state of fusion.</p>
                <p part="N">2. From* this diversity in the several qualities of things arises a
                    considerable difference as to the manner of our: judging concerning them. For
                    all such properties as are in· <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> separable from
                    objects when considered as belonging to any· genus or species, are affirmed
                    absolutely and without reserve of that general idea. Thus we say, “Gold is very
                    weighty ;” “A stone is hard ;” “Animals have a power of self-motion.” But in the
                    case of mutual or accidental qualities, as they depend upon some other
                    consideration distinct from the general idea, that must also be taken into the
                    account, in order to form an accurate judgment. Should we affirm, for instance,
                    of some stones, that they are very susceptible of a rolling motion, the
                    proposition, whilst it remains in this general form, cannot with any advantage
                    be introduced into our reasonings. An aptness to receive that mode of motion
                    flows from the figure of the stone, which, as it may vary infinitely, so our
                    judgment only becomes applicable and determinate, when the particular figure, of
                    which volubility is a consequence, is also taken into the account. Let us then
                    introduce this other consideration, and the proposition will run as follows:
                    “Stones of a spherical form are easily put into a rolling motion.” Here we see
                    the condition upon which the predicate is affirmed, and therefore know in what
                    particular cases the proposition may be applied.</p>
                <p part="N">3. This consideration of propositions respecting the manner in which the
                    predicate is affirmed of the subject, gives rise to the division of them into
                        <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> and <hi rend="italic">conditional.
                        Absolute</hi> propositions are those in which we affirm some property
                    inseparable from the idea of the subject, and which therefore belongs to it in
                    all possible cases; as, “God is infinitely wise “Virtue tends to the ultimate
                    happiness of man.” But where the predicate is not necessarily connected with the
                    idea of the subject, unless upon some consideration distinct from that idea,
                    there the proposition is called <hi rend="italic">conditional.</hi> The reason
                    of the name is taken from the supposition annexed, which is of the nature of a
                    condition, and may be expressed as such, thus: “If a stone be exposed to the
                    rays of the sun, it wilζcontract some degree of heat;” “If a river run jn a very
                    declining channel, its rapidity will constantly increase”</p>
                <p part="N">4. There is not any thing of greater importance in philosophy than a due
                    attention to this division of propositions. If we be careful never to affirm
                    things absolutely excepting where the ideas are inseparably conjoined, and if in
                    our other judgments we distinctly mark the conditions which determine the
                    predicate to belong to the subject, we shall be the less liable to mistake in
                    applying general truths to the particular concerns of human life. It is owing to
                    the exact observance of this rule that mathematicians have been so fortunate in
                    their discoveries, and that what they demonstrate of magnitude in general may be
                    applied with ease in all obvious occurrences.</p>
                <p part="N">5. The truth of it is, that particular propositions are only known to be
                    true, when we can trace their connection with universals; and it is accordingly
                    the great business of science to find out general truths which may be applied
                    with safety in all obvious instances. Now the great advantage arising from
                    determining with care the conditions upon which one idea may be affirmed or
                    denied of another, is this; that thereby particular propositions really become
                    universal, may be introduced with certainty into our reasonings, and serve as
                    standards to conduct and regulate our judgments. To illustrate this by a
                    familiar instance; if we say, “Some water acts very forcibly,” the proposition
                    is particular; and as the conditions on which this forcible action depends are
                    not mentioned, it is as yet uncertain in what cases it may be applied. Let us
                    then supply these conditions, and the proposition will run thus: “Water conveyed
                    in sufficient quantity along a steep descent acts very <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193207182?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7182-0443"/>forcibly.”
                    Here we have an universal judgment, inasmuch as the predicate <hi rend="italic"
                        >forcible action</hi> may be ascribed to all water under the circumstances
                    mentioned. Nor is it less evident that the proposition in this new form is of
                    easy application; and in fact we find that men do apply it in instances where
                    the forcible action of water is required, as in com-mills and many other works
                    of art.</p>
                <p part="N">5. <hi rend="italic">Of Simple and Compound Propositions.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">1. Hitherto we have treated of propositions where only two ideas arc
                    compared together. These are in the general called <hi rend="italic"
                        >simple,</hi> because, having but one subject and one predicate, they are
                    the effect of a simple judgment, that admits of no subdivision. But if it so
                    happens that several ideas offer themselves to our thoughts at once, by which we
                    are led to affirm the same thing of different objects, or different things of
                    the same object, then the propositions expressing these judgments are called <hi
                        rend="italic">'compound;</hi> because they may be resolved into as many
                    others as there are subjects or predicates in the whole complex determination on
                    the mind. Thus, “God is infinitely wise and infinitely powerful.” Here there are
                    two predicates, <hi rend="italic">infinite wisdom,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >infinite power,</hi> both affirmed of the same subject; and accordingly the
                    proposition may be resolved into two others, affirming these predicates
                    severally. In like manner, in the proposition, “Neither kings nor people are
                    exempt from death,” the predicate is denied of both subjects, and may therefore
                    be separated from them in distinct propositions. Nor is it less evident, that if
                    a complex judgment consists of several subjects and predicates, it may be
                    resolved into as many simple propositions as are the number of different ideas
                    compared together. “Riches and honours are apt to elate the mind, and increase
                    the number of our desires.” In this judgment there are two subjects and two
                    predicates, and it is at the same time apparent that it may be resolved into
                    four distinct propositions, “Riches are apt to elate the mind;” “Riches are apt
                    to increase the number of our desires.” And so of “honours.”</p>
                <p part="N">2. Logicians have divided these compound propositions into a great many
                    different classes; but, in our opinion, not with a due regard to their proper
                    definition. Thus, <hi rend="italic">conditionals,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >causais,</hi><hi rend="italic">relatives,</hi> and others, are mentioned as
                    so many distinct species of this kind, though in fact they are no more than
                    simple propositions. To give an instance of a conditional; “If a stone be
                    exposed to the rays of the sun, it will contract some degree of heat.” Here we
                    have but one subject and one predicate; for the complex expression, <hi
                        rend="italic">a stone exposed to the rays of the sun,</hi> constitutes the
                    proper subject of this proposition, and is no more than one determinate idea.
                    The same thing happens in causals. Thus, “Rehoboam was unhappy because he
                    followed evil counsel.” Here there is an appearance of two propositions arising
                    from the complexity of the expression; but when we come to consider the
                    mattcΓmorc nearly, it is evident that we have but a single subject and
                    predicate. “The pursuit of evil counsel brought misery upon Rehoboam.” It is not
                    enough, therefore, to render a proposition compound, that the subject and
                    predicate are complex notions, requiring sometimes a whole sentence to express
                    them; for in this case the comparison is still confined to two ideas, and
                    constitutes what we call a simple judgment. But where there are several subjects
                    or predicates, or both, as the affirmation or negation may be alike extended to
                    them all, the proposition expressing such a judgment is truly a collection of as
                    many simple ones as there are different ideas compared. Confining ourselves,
                    therefore, to this more strict and just notion of compound propositions, they
                    are all reducible to two kinds, viz. <hi rend="italic">copulatives</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">disjunctives.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">3. A <hi rend="italic">copulative</hi> proposition is, where the
                    subjects and predicates are so linked together that they may be all severally
                    affirmed or denied one of another. Of this nature aré the examples of compound
                    propositions given above. “Riches and honours are apt to elate the mind, and
                    increase the number of our desires ;” “Neither kings nor people are exempt from
                    death.” In the first of these, the two predicates may be affirmed severally of
                    each subject, whence we have four distinct propositions. The other furnishes an
                    example of the negative kind, where the same predicate, being disjoined from
                    both subjects, may be also denied of them in separate propositions.</p>
                <p part="N">4. The other species of compound propositions are those called
                    disjunctive; in which, comparing several predicates with the same subject, we
                    affirm that one of them necessarily belongs to it, but leave the particular
                    predicate undetermined. If any one, for example, says, “This world either exists
                    of itself, or is the work of some all-wise and powerful cause,” it is evident
                    that one of the two predicates must belong to the world; but as the proposition
                    determines not which, it is therefore of the kind we call <hi rend="italic"
                        >disjunctive.</hi> Such too are the following: “The sun either moves round
                    the earth, or is the centre about which the çarth revolves;” “Friendship finds
                    men equal, or makes them so.” It is the nature of all propositions of this
                    class, supposing them to be exact in point of form, that upon determining the
                    particular predicate, the rest are of course to be removed; or if all the
                    predicates but one are removed, that one necessarily takes effect, to the
                    exclusion of the others. Thus, in the example given above, i£ we allow the world
                    to be the work of some wise and powerful cause, we of course deny it to be
                    self-existent; or if we deny it to be self-existent, we must necessarily admit
                    that it was produced by some wise and powerful cause. Now this particular manner
                    of linking the predicates together, so that the establishing of one displaces
                    all the rest, or the excluding all but one necessarily establishes that one,
                    cannot otherwise be effected than by means of <hi rend="italic">disjunctive</hi>
                    particles. And hence it is that propositions of this class take their names from
                    these particles, which form so necessary a part of them, and indeed constitute
                    their very nature considered as a distinct species.</p>
                <p part="N">6. <hi rend="italic">Of the Division of Propositions into Self-evident
                        and Demonstrable.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">1. When any proposition is offered to the view of the mind, if the terms
                    in which it is expressed be understood, upon comparing the ideas together, the
                    agreement or disagreement asserted will either be immediately perceived, or will
                    be found to lie beyond the actual reach of the understanding. In the first case,
                    the proposition is said to be <hi rend="italic">self-evident,</hi> and admits
                    not of any proof, because a bare attention to the ideas themselves produces full
                    conviction and certainty; nor is it possible to call in any thing more evident
                    by way of confirmation. But where the connection or repugnance comes not so
                    readily under the inspection of the mfiid, we must have recourse to reasoning;
                    and if by a clear series of proofs we can make out the truth proposed, insomuch
                    that self-evidence shall accompany every step of the procedure, we are then able
                    to demonstrate what we assert, and the proposition itself is said to be <hi
                        rend="italic">demonstrable.</hi> When we affirm, for instance, “That it is
                    impossible for the same thing to be and not to be,” whoever understands the
                    terms made use of, perceives at the first glance the truth of what is asserted,
                    nor can he by any efforts bring himself to believe the contrary. The
                    proposition, therefore, is <hi rend="italic">self-evident,</hi> and such that it
                    is impossible by reasoning to make it plainer; because there is no truth more
                    obvious or better known, from which it may be deduced as a consequence. But if
                    we say, This world had a beginning,” the assertion is indeed equally true, but
                    shines not forth with the same degree of evidence. We find great difficulty in
                        conceiving<pb break="no" facs="nls:193207195?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-7195-0444"/> how the world could be made out of nothing,
                    and are not brought to a free and full consent, until by reasoning we arrive at
                    a clear view of the absurdity involved in the contrary supposition. Hence this
                    proposition is of the kind we call <hi rend="italic">demonstrable,</hi> inasmuch
                    as its truth is not immediately perceived by the mind, but yet may be made clear
                    by means of others more known and obvious, whence it follows as an unavoidable
                    consequence.</p>
                <p part="N">2. From what has been said, it appears that reasoning is employed only
                    about demonstrable propositions, and that our intuitive and self-evident
                    perceptions are the ultimate foundation upon which it rests.</p>
                <p part="N">3. Self-evident propositions furnish the first principles of reasoning;
                    and it is certain, that if in our researches we employ only such principles as
                    possess this character of selfevidence, and apply them according to the rules to
                    be afterwards explained, we shall be in no danger of error in advancing from one
                    discovery to another. For this we may appeal to the writings of the
                    mathematicians, which being conducted by the express model here mentioned,
                    furnish incontestable proof of the firmness and stability of human knowledge,
                    when built upon so sure a foundation. For not only have the propositions of this
                    science stood the test of ages, but they are found attended with that invincible
                    evidence, which forces the assent of all who duly consider the proofs upon which
                    they are established. Since the mathematicians are universally allowed to have
                    hit upon the right method of arriving at unknown truths, since they have been
                    the happiest in the choice as well as the application of their principles, it
                    may not be amiss to explain here their method of stating self-evident
                    propositions, and applying them to the purposes of demonstration.</p>
                <p part="N">4. First, then, it is to be observed, that they have been very careful
                    in ascertaining their ideas, and fixing the signification of their terms. For
                    this purpose they begin with <hi rend="italic">definitions,</hi> in which the
                    meaning of their words is so distinctly explained, that they cannot fail to
                    excite in the mind of an attentive reader the very same ideas which are annexed
                    to them by the writer. And indeed the clearness and irresistible evidence of
                    mathematical knowledge is owing to nothing so much as this care in laying the
                    foundation. Where the relation between any two ideas is accurately and justly
                    traced, it will not be difficult for another to comprehend that relation, if in
                    setting himself to discover it he brings the very same ideas into comparison.
                    But if, on the contrary, he affixes to his words ideas different from those that
                    were in the mind of him who first advanced the demonstration, it is evident,
                    that as the same ideas are not compared, the same relation cannot subsist,
                    insomuch that a proposition will be rejected as false, which, had the terms been
                    rightly understood, must have appeared incontestably true. A square, for
                    instance, is a figure bounded by four equal right lines, joined together at
                    right angles. Here the nature of the angles constitutes a part of the idea no
                    less than the equality of the sides; and many properties demonstrated of the
                    square are deduced entirely from its being a rectangular figure. If therefore we
                    suppose a man, who has formed a partial notion of a square, comprehending only
                    the equality of its sides, without regard to the angles, reading some
                    demonstration which implies also this latter consideration., it is plain that he
                    would reject it as not universally true, inasmuch as it could not be applied
                    where the sides were joined together at equal angles. For this last figure,
                    answering still to his idea of a square, would be yet found without the property
                    assigned toit in the proposition. But if he conies afterwards to correct his
                    notion, and to render his idea complete, he will then readily admit the truth
                    and justness of the demonstration.</p>
                <p part="N">5. We see, therefore, that nothing contributes so much to the
                    improvement and certainty of human knowledge, as the having determinate ideas,
                    and keeping them steady and invariable in all our discourses and reasonings
                    concerning them. On this account it is that mathematicians, as has already been
                    observed, always begin by defining their terms, and distinctly unfolding the
                    notions which they are intended to express. Hence such as apply themselves to
                    these studies have exactly the same views of things; and, bringing always the
                    very same ideas into comparison, they readily discern the relations between
                    them. It is likewise of importance, in every demonstration, to express the same
                        <hi rend="italic">idea</hi> invariably by the same word. From this practice
                    mathematicians never deviate; and if it be necessary in <hi rend="italic"
                        >their</hi> demonstrations, where the reader’s comprehension is <hi
                        rend="italic">aided</hi> by a diagram, it is much more so in all reasonings
                    concerning moral or intellectual truths, where the ideas cannot be represented
                    by a diagram. The observation of this rule may sometimes be productive of
                    ill-sounding periods; but when <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> is the object,
                    euphony ought to be disregarded.</p>
                <p part="N">6. When the mathematicians have taken this first step, and made known
                    the ideas the relations of which they intend to investigate, their next care is,
                    to lay down some self-evident truths, which may serve as a foundation for their
                    future reasonings. And here indeed they proceed with remarkable circumspection,
                    admitting no principles but such as flow immediately from their definitions, and
                    necessarily force themselves upon every mind in any degree attentive to its
                    ideas. Thus a <hi rend="italic">circle</hi> is a figure formed by a right line
                    moving round some fixed point in the same plane. The fixed point round which the
                    line is supposed to move, and where one of its extremities terminates, is called
                    the <hi rend="italic">centre</hi> of the circle. The other extremity, which is
                    conceived to be carried round until it returns to the point whence it first set
                    out, describes a curve running into itself, which is termed the <hi
                        rend="italic">circumference.</hi> All right lines drawn from the centre to
                    the circumference are called <hi rend="italic">radii.</hi> From this definition
                    geometricians derive the self-evident truth, “That the radii of the same circle
                    are all equal to one another ;” or rather, perhaps, it is part of, and involved
                    in, the very definition.</p>
                <p part="N">7. We may now observe, that in all propositions we either affirm or deny
                    some property of the idea which constitutes the subject of our judgment, or we
                    maintain that something may be done or effected, The first sort are called <hi
                        rend="italic">speculative</hi> propositions, as in the example mentioned
                    above, “The radii of the same circle are all equal one to another.” The others
                    are called <hi rend="italic">practical,</hi> for a reason too obvious to be
                    mentioned; thus, “That a right line may be drawn from one point to another,” is
                    a practical proposition, inasmuch as it expresses that something may be
                    done.</p>
                <p part="N">8. From this twofold consideration of propositions arises the twofold
                    division of mathematical principles into axioms and postulates. By an <hi
                        rend="italic">axiom</hi> is understood any self-evident speculative truth;
                    such as, “That the whole is greater than its parts ;” “That things equal to one
                    and the same thing are equal to one another.” But a self-evident practical
                    proposition is what is denominated a <hi rend="italic">postulate.</hi> Such are
                    those of Euclid: “That a finite right line may be continued directly forwards ;”
                    “That a circle may be described about any centre with any distance.” And here we
                    have to observe, that as in an axiom the agreement or disagreement between the
                    subject and predicate must come under the immediate inspection of the mind; so
                    in a postulate, not only the possibility of the thing asserted must be evident
                    at first view, but also the manner in which it may be effected. For where this
                    manner is not of itself apparent, the proposition comes under the notion of the
                    demonstrable kind, and is treated as such by geometrical writers. Thus, “To draw
                    a right line from one point to another,” is assumed by Euclid as a postulate,
                    because the manner ol doing it is so obvious, as to require no previous
                    teaching. But then it is not equally evident how we are to construct an
                    equilateral triangle. For this reason he advances it <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193207208?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7208-0445"/>as a
                    demonstrable proposition, lays down rules for the exact performance, and at the
                    same time proves, that if these rules are followed, the figure· described will
                    be an equilateral triangle.</p>
                <p part="N">9. This leads us to take notice, that as self-evident truths are
                    distinguishable into different kinds, accordingas they are speculative or
                    practical, so is it also with demonstrable propositions. A demonstrable
                    speculative proposition is by mathematicians called a <hi rend="italic"
                        >theorem.</hi> Such is the famous forty-seventh proposition of the first
                    book of the Elements, known by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Pythagorean
                        theorem,</hi> from its supposed inventor Pythagoras, viz. “That in every
                    right-angled triangle, the square described upon the side subtending the right
                    angle is equal to the sum of the squares described upon the sides containing the
                    right angle.” On the other hand, a demonstrable practical proposition is called
                    a <hi rend="italic">problem</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as where Euclid teaches
                    us to describe a square upon a given right line.</p>
                <p part="N">10. It may not be amiss to add, that, besides the four kinds of
                    propositions already mentioned, mathematicians have also a fifth, known by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">corollaries.</hi> These are usually subjoined in
                    theorems or problems, and differ from them only in this, that they flow from
                    what is there demonstrated, in so obvious a manner as to discover their
                    dependence upon the proposition whence they are deduced, almost as soon as
                    proposed. Thus, Euclid, having demonstrated, “That in every right-lined triangle
                    all the three angles taken together are equal to two right angles,” adds by way
                    of corollary, “That all the three angles of any one triangle taken together are
                    equal to all the three angles of any other triangle taken together which is
                    evident at first sight, because in all cases they are equal to two right angles,
                    and things which are equal to one and the same thing are equal to one
                        another.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">It
                            is proper here to caution the reader against being led into any
                            misconception as to the real nature of <hi rend="italic">axioms,</hi>
                            which, as above stated, have commonly been understood to mean
                            “self-evident speculative truths.” That they are “self-evident” is
                            undeniable; but it is not so easy to see how they can be called
                            “speculative truths,” since in all cases where they predicate <hi
                                rend="italic">equality</hi> they are <hi rend="italic">identical
                                propositions,</hi> and, where they do not, they are mere <hi

                            propositions of such a kind that to suppose the contrary would involve
                            an obvious absurdity. When we say, That the whole is equal to all its
                            parts put together, or, That things which are equal to the same thing
                            are equal to one another, we merely express two identical propositions,
                            or in effect just affirm that <hi rend="italic">a = a,</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">=y</hi><hi rend="italic"
                                >;</hi> affirmations which can add nothing either to the evidence or
                            the truth of any demonstration. Such propositions amount only to a sort
                            of <hi rend="italic">jeu</hi><hi rend="italic">de mots.</hi> Besides,
                            they are illogical, inasmuch as the “self-evident” truth which is
                            predicated in the second is invariably assumed in the first branch of
                            the proposition. The “whole” necessarily includes all its parts, and
                            “things equal to one and the same thing” involve mutual equality. If we
                            were to repeat the axiom, “That whatever is, is for an age, or for ages,
                            we would not be in any respect wiser, or nearer to the discovery of any
                            truth not self-evident, than we were before. Again, when we say, That
                            the whole is greater than any of its parts, we merely affirm a truism,
                            since the bare idea of a “whole” necessarily excludes that of the
                            equality of any of its parts. It is, therefore, a mistake to suppose
                            that axioms add any thing to the clearness or force of mathematical
                            evidence. No conclusion whatever can be deduced from an identical
                            proposition, in which the thing assumed is also the thing predicated.
                            The whole fabric of geometry is built, not upon axioms, but upon <hi
                                rend="italic">definitions,</hi> expressing simple facts, as, for
                            instance, the definition of a circle; and the real character of
                            geometrical evidence consists in this, that it is founded, not upon
                            identical propositions or truisms, but upon an appeal to observation,
                            though of the simplest and most elementary kind. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    definitions, propositions, or corollaries, and answer the same purposes as
                    annotations upon a classic author. For in them occasion is taken to explain
                    whatever may appear intricate and obscure in a train of reasoning; to answer
                    objections; to teach the application and uses of propositions; to lay open the
                    origin and history of the several discoveries which have been made in the
                    science; and, in a word, to acquaint us with all such particulars as deserve to
                    be known, whether considered as points of curiosity or of profit.</p>
                <p part="N">III.—OF REASONING.</p>
                <p part="N">1. <hi rend="italic">Of Reasoning in general, and the Parts of which it
                        consists.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">It often happens, in comparing together ideas, that their agreement or
                    disagreement cannot be discerned at first view, especially if they are of such a
                    nature as not to admit of an exact application one to another.</p>
                <p part="N">When, for instance, we compare two figures of a different form, in order
                    to judge of their equality or inequality, it is plain, that by barely
                    considering the figures themselves, we cannot arrive at an exact determination,
                    because, by reason of their disagreeing forms, it is impossible so to put them
                    together that their several parts shall mutually coincide. Here, then, it
                    becomes necessary to look out for some third idea which will admit of such an
                    application as the case requires, wherein, if we succeed, all difficulties
                    vanish, and the relation we are in quest of may be traced with ease. Thus,
                    right-lined figures are all reduced to squares, by means of which we can measure
                    their areas, and determine exactly their agreement or disagreement in point of
                    magnitude.</p>
                <p part="N">2. But how can any third idea serve to discover a relation between tvΓo
                    others? The answer is, by being compared severally with these others; for such a
                    comparison enables us to discern how far the ideas with which this third is
                    compared are connected or disjoined between themselves. In the example mentioned
                    above, of two right-lined figures, if we compare each of them with some square
                    whose area is known, and find the one exactly equal to it, and the other less by
                    a square inch, we immediately conclude that the area of the first figure is a
                    square inch greater than that of the second. This manner of determining the
                    relation between any two ideas, by the intervention of some third one with which
                    they may be compared, is that which we call <hi rend="italic">reasoning,</hi>
                    and is indeed the chief instrument by which we extend our discoveries and
                    enlarge our knowledge. The great art consists in finding out such intermediate
                    ideas as, when compared with others in the question, will furnish evident and
                    known truths; because, as will afterwards appear, it is only by means of these
                    that we arrive at the knowledge of what is hidden and remote.</p>
                <p part="N">3. Hence it appears that every act of reasoning necessarily includes
                    three distinct judgments; two in which the ideas whose relation we want to
                    discover are severally compared with the middle idea, and a third in which they
                    are themselves connected or disjoined, according to the result of that
                    comparison. Now, as in the second part of logic, our judgments, when put into
                    words, were called propositions, so here in the third part the expressions of
                    our reasonings are termed <hi rend="italic">syllogisms.</hi> And hence it
                    follows, that as every act of reasoning implies three several judgments, so
                    every syllogism must include three distinct propositions. When reasoning is thus
                    put into words, and appears in the form of a syllogism, the intermediate idea
                    made use of to discover the agreement or disagreement we search for is called
                    the <hi rend="italic">middle term,</hi> and the two ideas themselves with which
                    this third is compared are denominated the <hi rend="italic">extremes.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207221?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7221-0446"/>
                <p part="N">4. But as these things are best illustrated by examples, let us, for
                    instance, set ourselves to inquire “Whether men be accountable for their
                    actions.” As the relation between the ideas of <hi rend="italic">man</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">accountableness</hi> comes not within the immediate view
                    of the mind, our first care must be to find out some third idea that will enable
                    us the more easily to discover and trace it. A very small measure of reflection
                    is sufficient to inform us, that no creature can be accountable for his actions
                    unless we suppose him capable of distinguishing good from evil; that is, unless
                    we suppose him possessed of reason. Nor is this alone sufficient. For what would
                    it avail him to know good from evil actions if he had no freedom of choice, and
                    could not avoid the one or pursue the other? Hcncc it becomes necessary to take
                    in both considerations in the present case. It is at the same time equally
                    apparent, that wherever there is the ability of distinguishing good from bad
                    actions, and of pursuing the one and avoiding the other, there also a creature
                    is accountable. We have then got a third idea, with which <hi rend="italic"
                        >accountableness</hi> is inseparably connected, viz. <hi rend="italic"
                        >reason and liberty,</hi> which are here to be considered as forming one
                    complex conception. Let us 'now take this middle idea, and compare it with the
                    other term in the question, viz. <hi rend="italic">man,</hi> and we all know by
                    experience that it may be affirmed of him. Having thus, by means of the
                    intermediate idea, formed two several judgments, viz. <hi rend="italic">that man
                        is possessed of reason and liberty,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">that reason
                        and liberty imply accountableness,</hi> a third obviously and necessarily
                    follows, viz. <hi rend="italic">that man is accountable for his actions.</hi>
                    Here then we have a complete act of reasoning, in which, according to what has
                    been already observed, there are three distinct judgments; two which may be
                    styled previous, inasmuch as they lead to the other, and arise from comparing
                    the middle idea with the two ideas contained in the question; the third is a
                    consequence of these previous acts, and flows from combining the extreme ideas
                    between themselves. If now we put this reasoning into words, it exhibits what
                    logicians term a syllogism, and, when proposed in due form, runs thus: “Every
                    creature possessed of reason and liberty is accountable for his actions. Man is
                    a creature possessed of reason and liberty: Therefore man is accountable for his
                    actions.”</p>
                <p part="N">5. In this syllogism we may observe, that there are three several
                    propositions expressing the three judgments implied in the act of reasoning, and
                    so disposed as to represent distinctly what passes within the mind in tracing
                    the more distant relations of its ideas. The first two propositions answer the
                    two previous judgments in reasoning, and arc called the <hi rend="italic"
                        >premises,</hi> because they are placed before the other. The third is
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">conclusion,</hi> as being gained in consequence of
                    what was asserted in the premises. We are also to remember that the terms
                    expressing the two ideas the relations of which we inquire into, as <hi
                        rend="italic">man</hi> and <hi rend="italic">accountableness,</hi> are in
                    general called the <hi rend="italic">extremes</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    that the intermediate idea, by means of which the relation is traced, viz. <hi
                        rend="italic">a creature possessed of reason and liberty,</hi> takes the
                    name of the <hi rend="italic">middle term.</hi> Hence it follows, that by the
                        <hi rend="italic">premises</hi> of a syllogism we are always to understand
                    the two propositions where the middle term is severally compared with the <hi
                        rend="italic">extremes;</hi> for these constitute the previous judgments,
                    whence the truth we are in quest of is by reasoning deduced. The <hi
                        rend="italic">conclusion</hi> is that other proposition, in which the <hi
                        rend="italic">extremes</hi> themselves arc joined or separated, agreeably to
                    what appears upon the above comparison.</p>
                <p part="N">6. The conclusion is made up of the extreme terms of the syllogism; and
                    the extreme which serves as the predicate of the conclusion goes by⅞the name of
                    the <hi rend="italic">major term</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the other extreme,
                    which makes the subject in the same proposition, is called the <hi rend="italic"
                        >minor term.</hi> From this distinction of the extremes arises also a
                    distinction be tween the premises, where these extremes are severally compared
                    with the middle term. That proposition which compares the greater extreme, or
                    the predicate of the conclusion, with the middle term, is called the <hi
                        rend="italic">major proposition</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the other, in
                    which the same middle term is compared with the subject of the conclusion or
                    lesser extreme, is called the <hi rend="italic">minor proposition.</hi> All this
                    is obvious from the syllogism already stated, where the conclusion is, “Man is
                    accountable for his actions.” For here the predicate <hi rend="italic"
                        >accountable for his actions</hi> being connected with the middle term in
                    the first of the two premises, “Every creature possessed of reason and liberty
                    is accountable for his actions,” gives what we call the <hi rend="italic">major
                        proposition.</hi> In the second of the premises, “Man is a creature
                    possessed of reason and liberty,” we find the lesser extreme, or subject of the
                    conclusion, viz. <hi rend="italic">man,</hi> connected with the same middle
                    term, whence it is known to be the <hi rend="italic">minor proposition.</hi>
                    When a syllogism is proposed in due form, the major proposition is always placed
                    first, the minor next, and the conclusion last.</p>
                <p part="N">7. These things being premised, we may in general define reasoning to be
                    an act or operation of the mind deducing some unknown proposition from other
                    previous ones which are evident and known. These previous propositions, in a
                    simple act of reasoning, are only two in number; and it is always required that
                    they be of themselves apparent to the understanding, insomuch that we assent to
                    and perceive the truth of them as soon as proposed. In the syllogism above
                    given, the premises are supposed to be self-evident truths, otherwise the
                    conclusion could not be inferred by a single act of reasoning. If, for instance,
                    in the major, “Every creature possessed of reason and liberty is accountable for
                    his actions,” the connection between the subject and predicate could not be
                    perceived by a bare attention to the ideas themselves, it is evident that this
                    proposition would no less require a proof than the conclusion deduced from it.
                    In this case a new middle term must be sought for to trace the connection here
                    supposed; and this of course furnishes another syllogism, by which having
                    established the proposition in question, we are then, and not before, at liberty
                    to use it in any succeeding train of reasoning. And should it so happen, that in
                    this second essay there still existed some previous proposition whose truth did
                    not appear at first sight, we must then have recourse to a third syllogism in
                    order to lay open that truth to the mind; because, as long as the premises
                    remain uncertain, the conclusion built upon them must be so likewise. When, by
                    conducting our thoughts in this manner, we at last arrive at some syllogism
                    where the previous propositions are intuitive truths, the mind then rests in
                    full security, as perceiving that the several conclusions it has passed through
                    stand upon the immoveable foundation of self-evidence, and, when traced to their
                    source, terminate in it.</p>
                <p part="N">8. We see, therefore, that in order to infer a conclusion by a single
                    act of reasoning, the premises must be intuitive propositions. Where they are
                    not, previous syllogisms are required; in which case reasoning becomes a
                    complicated act, taking in a variety of successive steps. This frequently
                    happens in tracing the more remote relation of our ideas, where, many middle
                    terms being called in, the conclusion cannot be made out but in consequence of a
                    series of syllogisms following one another in train. But although in this
                    concatenation of propositions, those which form the premises of the last
                    syllogism are often considerably removed from self-evidence, yet if we trace the
                    reasoning backwards, we shall find them the conclusions of previous syllogisms,
                    whose premises approach nearer and nearer to intuition in proportion as we
                    advance, and are found at last to terminate in it. And if, after having thus
                    unravelled a demonstration, we take it the contrary way, <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193207234?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7234-0447"/>and observe
                    how the mind, setting out with intuitive perceptions, couples them together to
                    form a conclusion; how, by introducing this conclusion into another syllogism,
                    it still advances one step farther, and so proceeds, making every new discovery
                    subservient to its future progress; we shall then perceive clearly that
                    reasoning, in the highest sense of that faculty, is no more than an orderly
                    combination of those simple acts which we have already so fully explained.</p>
                <p part="N">9. Thus we see, that reasoning, beginning with first principles, rises
                    gradually from one judgment to another, and connects them in such manner that
                    every stage of the progression brings intuitive certainty along with it. And now
                    at length we may clearly understand the definition given above of this
                    distinguishing faculty of the human mind. Reason, we have said, is the ability
                    of deducing unknown truths from principles or propositions which arc already
                    known. This appears evident by the foregoing account, where we see that no
                    proposition is admitted into a syllogism to serve as one of the previous
                    judgments on which the conclusion rests, unless it be itself a known and
                    established truth, the connection of which with self-evident principles has
                    already been traced.</p>
                <p part="N">2. <hi rend="italic">Of the several kinds of Reasoning</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">and, first, of that by which we
                        determine the Genera and Species of Things.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">All the aims of human reason may in the general be reduced to these two:
                    First, to rank things under those universal ideas to which they truly belong;
                    and, secondly, to ascribe to them their several attributes and properties in
                    consequence of that distribution.</p>
                <p part="N">2. One great aim of human reason is to determine the genera and species
                    of things. We have seen, in the first part of this treatise, how the mind
                    proceeds in framing general ideas. We have also seen, in the second part, how,
                    by means of these general ideas, we come by universal propositions. Now, as in
                    these universal propositions we affirm some property of a genus or species, it
                    is plain that we cannot apply this property to particular objects till we have
                    first determined whether they are comprehended under that general idea of which
                    the property is affirmed. Thus there are certain properties belonging to all <hi
                        rend="italic">even</hi> numbers, which nevertheless cannot be applied to any
                    particular number, until we have first discovered it to be of the species
                    expressed by that natural name. Hence reasoning begins with referring things to
                    their several divisions and classes in the scale of our ideas; and as these
                    divisions are all distinguished by particular names, we thereby learn to apply
                    the terms expressing general conceptions to such particular objects as come
                    under our immediate observation.</p>
                <p part="N">3. Now, in order to arrive at these conclusions, by which the several
                    objects of perception are brought under general names, two things are manifestly
                    necessary. First, that we should take a view of the idea itself, which is
                    denoted by that general name, and carefully attend to the distinguishing marks
                    which serve to characterize it. Secondly, that we should compare this idea with
                    the object under consideration, observing diligently wherein they agree or
                    differ. If the idea be found to correspond with the particular object, we then
                    without hesitation apply the general name; but if no such correspondence
                    intervene, the conclusion must necessarily take a contrary turn. Let us, for
                    instance, take the number <hi rend="italic">eight,</hi> and consider by what
                    steps we are led to pronounce it an <hi rend="italic">even</hi> number. First,
                    then, we call to mind the idea signified by the expression <hi rend="italic">an
                        even number,</hi> viz. that it is a number divisible into two equal parts.
                    We then compare this idea with the number <hi rend="italic">eight,</hi> and
                    finding them manifestly to agree, see at once the necessity of admitting the
                    conclusion. These several judgments, therefore, transferred into language, and
                    reduced to the form of a syllogism, appear thus: “Every number that may be
                    divided into two equal parts is an <hi rend="italic">even</hi> number: The
                    number eight may be divided into two equal parts: Therefore the number <hi
                        rend="italic">eight</hi> is an <hi rend="italic">even</hi> number.”</p>
                <p part="N">4. Here it may be observed, that where the general idea, to which
                    particular objects are referred, is perfectly familiar to the mind, and
                    frequently in view, this reference, and the application of the general name,
                    seem to be made without any apparatus of reasoning. When we see a horse in the
                    fields, or a dog in the street, we readily apply the name of fhe <hi
                        rend="subscript"> n</hi> species; habit, and a familiar acquaintance with
                    the general idea, suggesting it instantaneously to the mind. We are not however
                    tojmagine on this account that the understanding departs from the usual rules of
                    just thinking. A frequent repetition of acts begets a habit; and habits are
                    attended with a certain promptness of execution, which prevents our observing
                    the several steps and gradations by which any course of action is accomplished.
                    But in other instances, where we judge not by precontracted habits, as when the
                    general idea is very complex, or less familiar to the mind, we always proceed
                    according to the form of reasoning established above. A goldsmith, for instance,
                    who is in doubt as to any piece of metal, whether it be of the species called
                        <hi rend="italic">gold,</hi> first examines its properties, and then,
                    comparing them with the general idea signified by that name, if he find a
                    perfect correspondence, no longer hesitates under what class of metals to rank
                    it.</p>
                <p part="N">5. Nor let it be imagined that our researches here, because in
                    appearance bounded to the imposing of general names upon particular objects, afe
                    therefore trivial and of little consequence. Some of the most considerable
                    debates amongst mankind, and such too as nearly regard their lives, interest,
                    and happiness, turn wholly upon this article. Is it not the chief employment of
                    our several courts of judicature to determine, in particular instances, what is
                    law, justice, and equity? Of what importance is it in many cases to decide
                    aright whether an action shall be termed <hi rend="italic">murder</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">manslaughter 2</hi> We perceive then that no less than the
                    lives and fortunes of men depend often upon these decisions. The reason is
                    plain. Actions, when once referred to <hi rend="italic">a</hi> general idea,
                    draw after them all that may be affirmed of that idea; insomuch that the
                    determining the species of actions is all one with determining what proportion
                    of praise or dispraise, commendation or blame, ought to follow them. For as it
                    is allowed that murder deserves death, by bringing any particular action under
                    the head of murder, we of course decide the punishment due to it.</p>
                <p part="N">6. But the great importance of this branch of reasoning, and the
                    necessity of care and circumspection in referring particular objects to general
                    ideas, is still further evident from the practice of the mathematicians. Every
                    one who has read Euclid, knows that he frequently requires us to draw lines
                    through certain points, and according to such and such directions; and that the
                    figures thence resulting are often squares, parallelograms, or rectangles. Yet
                    Euclid never supposes this from their bare appearance, but always demonstrates
                    it upon the strictest principles of geometry. Nor is the method he takes in any
                    thing different from that described above. Thus, for instance, having defined a
                    square to be a figure bounded by four equal sides joined together at right
                    angles, when such a figure arises in any construction previous to the
                    demonstration of a proposition, he never calls it by that name until he has
                    shown that its sides are equal, and all its angles right angles. Now this is
                    apparently the same form of reasoning we have before exhibited in proving <hi
                        rend="italic">eight</hi> to be an even number.</p>
                <p part="N">7. Having thus explained the rules by which we are to conduct ourselves
                    in ranking particular objects under general ideas, and shown their conformity to
                    the practice and manner of the mathematicians, it remains only to observe, that
                    the true way of rendering this part of knowledge both <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193207247?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7247-0448"/>easy and
                    certain is, by habituating ourselves to clear and determinate ideas, and by
                    keeping these steadily annexed to their respective names. For as all our aim is
                    to apply general words aright, if these words stand for invariable ideas which
                    are perfectly known to the mind, and can be readily distinguished upon occasion,
                    there will be little danger of mistake or error in our reasonings. Let us
                    suppose that, by examining any object, and carrying our attention successively
                    from one part of it to another, we have made ourselves acquainted with the
                    several particulars observable in it. If amongst these we find such as
                    constitute some general idea, framed and settled beforehand by the
                    understanding, and distinguished by a particular name, the resemblance thus
                    known and perceived necessarily determines the species of the object, and
                    thereby gives it a right to the name by which that species is called. Thus four
                    equal sides, joined together at right angles, constitute the notion of a <hi
                        rend="italic">square.</hi> As this is a fixed and invariable idea, without
                    which the general name cannot be applied, wc never call any particular figure a
                        <hi rend="italic">square</hi> until it appears to have these several
                    conditions; and, contrarily, wherever a figure is found to possess these
                    conditions, it necessarily takes the name of a <hi rend="italic">square.</hi>
                    The same will be found to hold in all our other reasonings of this kind, where
                    nothing can create any difficulty but the want of settled ideas. If, for
                    instance, we have not determined within ourselves the precise notion denoted by
                    the word <hi rend="italic">manslaughter,</hi> it will be impossible for us to
                    decide whether any particular action ought to bear that name; because, however
                    nicely we may examine the action itself, yet, being strangers to the general
                    idea with which it is to be compared, we are utterly unable to judge of their
                    agreement or disagreement. But if we take care to remove this obstacle, and
                    distinctly trace the two ideas under consideration, all difficulties vanish, and
                    the resolution becomes both easy and certain.</p>

                    certainty of human knowledge, that we should accustom ourselves· to clear and

                <p part="N">1. We now come to the second great end which men have in view in their
                    reasonings; namely, the discovering and ascribing to things their several
                    attributes and properties. And here it will be necessary to distinguish between
                    reasoning, as it regards the sciences, and as it concerns common life. In the
                    sciences, our reason is employed chiefly about universal truths, because by
                    these alone arc the bounds of human knowledge enlarged. Hence the division of
                    things into various classes, called otherwise <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">species.</hi> For these universal ideas being set up as
                    the representatives of many particular things, whatever is affirmed of them may
                    be also affirmed of all the individuals to which they belong. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Murder,</hi> for instance, is a general idea, representing a certain
                    species of human actions. Reason tells us that the punishment due to it is <hi
                        rend="italic">death.</hi> Hence every particular action, coming under the
                    notion of <hi rend="italic">murder,</hi> has the punishment of <hi rend="italic"
                        >death</hi> allotted to it. Here then we apply the general truth to some
                    obvious instance, and this is what properly constitutes the reasoning of common
                    life; for men, in their ordinary transactions and intercourse with one another,
                    have, for the most part, to do only with particular objects. Our friends and
                    relations, their characters and behaviour, the constitution of the several
                    bodies that surround us, and the uses to which they may be applied, are what
                    chiefly engage our attention. In all these, we reason about particular things;
                    and the whole result of our reasoning is, the applying the general truths of the
                    sciences in the ordinary transactions of human life. When we see a viper, we
                    avoid it. Wherever we have occasion for the forcible action of water to move a
                    body which makes considerable resistance, we take care to convey it in such a
                    manner that it shall fall upon the object with impetuosity. Now all this happens
                    in consequence of our familiar and ready application of these two general
                    truths: “The bite of a viper is mortal ;” “Water falling upon any body with
                    impetus, acts very forcibly towards setting it in motion.” In like manner, if we
                    set ourselves to consider any particular character, in order to determine the
                    share of praise or dispraise which belongs to it, our great concern is to
                    ascertain exactly the proportion of virtue and vice. The reason is obvious. A
                    just determination, in all cases of this kind, depends entirely upon an
                    application of these general maxims of morality: “Virtuous actions deserve
                    praise ;” “Vicious actions deserve blame.”</p>
                <p part="N">2. Hence it appears that reasoning, as it regards common life, is no
                    more than the ascribing the general properties of things to those several
                    objects with which we are more immediately concerned, according as they are
                    found to be of that particular division or class to which the properties belong.
                    The steps, then, by which we proceed, are manifestly these. First, we refer the
                    object under consideration to some general idea or class of things. We then
                    recollect the several attributes of that general idea. And, lastly, we ascribe
                    all those attributes to the actual object. Thus, in considering the character of
                    Sempronius, if we find it to be of the kind called <hi rend="italic"
                        >virtuous,</hi> when we at the same time reflect that a virtuous character
                    is deserving of esteem, it naturally and obviously follows that Sempronius is an
                    estimable man. These thoughts put into a <hi rend="italic">syllogism,</hi> in
                    order to exhibit the form of reasoning here required, run thus: “Every virtuous
                    man is worthy of esteem. Sempronius is a virtuous man: Therefore Sempronius is
                    worthy of esteem.”</p>
                <p part="N">3. By this <hi rend="italic">syllogism</hi> it appears, that before we
                    affirm anything of a particular object, that object must be referred to some
                    general idea. Sempronius is pronounced w orthy of esteem only in consequence of
                    his being a virtuous man, or coming under that general notion. Hence we see the
                    necessary connection of the various parts of reasoning, and the dependence which
                    they have one upon another. The determining the genera and the species of things
                    is, as we have said, one exercise of human reason; and here we find that this
                    exercise is the first inorder, and previous to the other, which consists in
                    ascribing to them their powers, properties, and relations. But when we,have
                    taken this previous step, and brought particular objects under general names, as
                    the properties we ascribe to them are no other than those of the general idea,
                    it is plain that, in order to a successful progress in this part of knowledge,
                    we must thoroughly acquaint ourselves with the several relations and attributes
                    of these our general ideas. When this is done, the other part will be easy, and
                    require scarcely any labour or thought, being no more than an application of the
                    general form of reasoning represented in the foregoing syllogism. Now, as it has
                    already been sufficiently shown how we are to proceed in determining the genera
                    and species of things, which, as we have stated, is the previous step to this
                    second branch of human knowledge, all that is further wanting towards a due
                    explanation of it is, to offer some considerations as to the manner of
                    investigating the general relations of our ideas. This is the highest exercise
                    of the powers of the understanding, and that by means of which we arrive at the
                    discovery of universal truths; insomuch that our deductions in this way
                    constitute that particular species of reasoning which, we have before said,
                    regards principally the sciences.</p>
                <p part="N">4. But, that we may conduct our thoughts with some degree of order and
                    method, we shall begin with observing, <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193207260?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7260-0449"/>that the
                    relations of our general ideas are of two kinds; either such as immediately
                    discover themselves, upon comparing the ideas one with another; or such as,
                    being more remote and distant, require art and contrivance to bring them into
                    view. The relations of the first kind furnish us with intuitive and self-evident
                    truths. Those of the second are traced by reasoning, and a due application of
                    intermediate ideas. It is of the latter kind that we are to speak here, having
                    despatched what was necessary with regard to the other in the second part. As,
                    therefore, in tracing the more distant relations of things, we must always have
                    recourse to intervening ideas, and are more or less successful in our
                    researches, according to our acquaintance with these ideas, and ability in
                    applying them; so it is evident that, to make a good reasoner, two things are
                    principally required; <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> An extensive knowledge of
                    those intermediate ideas, by means of which things may be compared one with
                    another; and, <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> The skill and talent of applying
                    them happily in all particular instances which come under consideration.</p>
                <p part="N">5. In order to our successful progress in reasoning, we must have an
                    extensive knowledge of those intermediate ideas by means of which things may be
                    compared one with another. For as it is not every idea that will answer the
                    purpose of our inquiries, but only such as are peculiarly related to the objects
                    about which we reason, so as, by a comparison with them, to furnish evident and
                    known truths, nothing is more apparent than that, the greater variety of
                    conceptions we can call into view, the more likely are we to find some amongst
                    them which will help us to the truths here required. And, indeed, it is found to
                    hold in experience, that in proportion as we enlarge our views of things, and
                    grow acquainted with a multitude of different objects, the reasoning faculty
                    gathers strength; for, by extending our sphere of knowledge, the mind acquires a
                    certain force and penetration, as being accustomed to examine the several
                    appearances of its ideas, and observe what light they throw upon one
                    another.</p>
                <p part="N">6. This is the reason why, in order to excel remarkably in any one
                    branch of learning, it is necessary to have at least a general acquaintance with
                    the whole circle of the arts and sciences. The truth is, that all the various
                    divisions of human knowledge are very nearly related amongst themselves, and, in
                    innumerable instances, serve to illustrate and set off one another. And although
                    it is not to be denied that, by an obstinate application to one branch of study,
                    a man may make considerable progress, and acquire some degree of eminence in it,
                    yet his views will always be narrow and contracted, and he will want that
                    masterly discernment which not only enables us to pursue our discoveries with
                    ease, but also, in laying them open to others, to spread a certain brightness
                    around them. But when our reasoning regards a particular science, it is further
                    necessary that we should more nearly acquaint ourselves with whatever relates to
                    that science. A general knowledge is a good preparation, and enables us to
                    proceed with ease and expedition in whatever branch of learning we apply to. But
                    then, in the minute and intricate questions of any science, we are by no means
                    qualified to reason with advantage until we have perfectly mastered the science
                    to which they belong.</p>
                <p part="N">7. We come now to the second thing required in order to a successful
                    progress in reasoning; namely, the skill md talent of applying intermediate
                    ideas happily in all particular instances that come under consideration. And
                    here rules and precepts are of little service. Use and experience are the best
                    instructors. For, however logicians may boast of being able to form perfect
                    reasoners by book and rule, we find by experience that the study of their
                    precepts does not always add any great degree of strength to he understanding.
                    In short, it is the habit alone of rea-</p>
                <p part="N">soning that makes a reasoner; and therefore the true way to acquire this
                    talent is, by being much conversant in those sciences where the art of reasoning
                    requires to be exercised in the greatest perfection. Hence it was that the
                    ancients, who so well understood the manner of forming the mind, always began
                    with <hi rend="italic">mathematics</hi> as the foundation of their philosophical
                    studies. In this pursuit the understanding is by degrees habituated to truth, it
                    contracts insensibly a certain fondness for it, and learns never to yield its
                    assent to any proposition but where the evidence is sufficient to produce full
                    conviction. For this reason Plato has called mathematical demonstrations the <hi
                        rend="italic">cathartics</hi> or purgatives of the soul, as being the proper
                    means of cleansing it from error, and restoring that natural exercise of its
                    faculties in which just thinking consists.</p>
                <p part="N">8. If, therefore, we would form our minds to a habit of reasoning
                    closely and in train, we cannot take any more certain method than that of
                    exercising ourselves in mathematical demonstrations, so as to contract a kind of
                    familiarity with them. Not that we look upon it as necessary that all men should
                    be deep mathematicians; but that, having mastered the way of reasoning which
                    that study necessarily brings the mind to, they may be able to transfer it to
                    other parts of knowledge, as they shall afterwards have occasion.</p>
                <p part="N">9. But though the study of mathematics be of all others the most useful
                    to form the mind, and to give it an early relish for truth, yet other parts of
                    philosophy ought not to be neglected. For there also we meet with many
                    opportunities of exercising the powers of the understanding; and the variety of
                    subjects naturally leads us to observe all those different turns of thinking
                    which are peculiarly adapted to the several ideas we examine, and the truth we
                    search after. A mind thus trained acquires a certain mastery over its own
                    thoughts, insomuch that it can arrange and model them at pleasure, and call such
                    into view as best suit its actual designs. Now in this consists the whole art of
                    reasoning; from amongst a great variety of different ideas to single out those
                    which are most proper for the business in hand, and to lay them together in such
                    order, that from plain and easy beginnings, by gentle degrees, and a continued
                    train of evident truths, we maybe insensibly led on to such discoveries as at
                    our first setting out would appear beyond the reach of human understanding. For
                    this purpose, besides the study of mathematics already recommended, we should
                    apply ourselves diligently to the reading of such authors as have distinguished
                    themselves for strength of reasoning, and a just and accurate manner of
                    thinking; for it is observable, that a mind exercised and seasoned to truth
                    seldom rests satisfied with the bare contemplation of the arguments offered by
                    others, but will be frequently essaying its own strength, and pursuing its
                    discoveries upon the plan which it is most accustomed to. Thus we insensibly
                    contract a habit of tracing truth from one stage to another, and of
                    investigating those general relations and properties which we afterwards ascribe
                    to particular things, according as we find them comprehended under the abstract
                    ideas to which the properties belong.</p>
                <p part="N">4. <hi rend="italic">Of the Forms of Syllogisms.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">1. Hitherto we have contented ourselves with giving a general notion of
                    syllogisms, and of the parts of which they consist. It is now time to enter a
                    little more particularly into the subject, to examine their various forms, and
                    to lay down the rules of argumentation proper to each. In the syllogisms
                    mentioned in the foregoing chapters, we may observe, that the <hi rend="italic"
                        >middle term</hi> is the subject of the <hi rend="italic">major ∙</hi>
                    proposition, and the predicate of the <hi rend="italic">minor.</hi> This
                    disposition, though the most natural and obvious, is not, however, necessary, as
                    it frequently happens that the middle <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193207273?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7273-0450"/>term is the
                    subject in both the premises, or the predicate in both; and sometimes, directly
                    contrary to its disposition in the foregoing chapters, it is the predicate in
                    the major, and the subject in the minor. Hence the distinction of syllogisms
                    into various kinds, called <hi rend="italic">figures</hi> by logicians; for
                    figure, according to their use of the word, is nothing else but the order and
                    disposition of the middle term in any syllogism. And as this disposition is, as
                    we have shown, fourfold, so the figures of syllogisms thence arising are four in
                    number. When the middle term is the subject of the major proposition, and the
                    predicate of the minor, we have what is called the <hi rend="italic">first
                        figure</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as, “No work of God is bad: The natural
                    passions and appetites of men are the tVerk of God: Therefore none of them is
                    bad.” If, on the other hand, it is the predicate of both the premises, the
                    syllogism is said to be the <hi rend="italic">second figure</hi>; as, “Whatever
                    is bad is not the work of God: All the natural passions and appetites of men are
                    the work of God: Therefore the natural passions and appetites of men are not
                    bad.” Again, in the <hi rend="italic">third figure,</hi> the middle term is the
                    subject of the two premises: as, <hi rend="superscript"> ζζ</hi> All Africans
                    are black: All Africans are men: Therefore some men are black.” And, lastly, by
                    making it the predicate of the major, and subject of the minor, we obtain
                    syllogisms in the <hi rend="italic">fourth figure;</hi> as, “The only Being who
                    ought to be worshipped is the Creator and Governor of the world: The Creator and
                    Governor of the world is God: Therefore God is the only Being who ought to be
                    worshipped.”</p>
                <p part="N">2. But, besides this fourfold distinction of syllogisms, there is also a
                    further subdivision of them in every figure, arising from the <hi rend="italic"
                        >quantity</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quality,</hi> as they are called, of
                    the propositions. By quantity we mean the consideration of propositions, as
                    universal or particular; by quality, as affirmative or negative.</p>
                <p part="N">Now as, in all the several dispositions of the middle term, the
                    propositions of which a syllogism consists may be either universal or
                    particular, affirmative or negative, the due determination of these, and the
                    putting them together as the laws of argumentation require, constitute what
                    logicians call the <hi rend="italic">moods</hi> of syllogisms. Of these moods
                    there is a determinate number to every figure, including all the possible ways
                    in which propositions differing in quantity or quality can be combined,
                    according to any disposition of the middle term, in order to arrive at a just
                    conclusion.</p>
                <p part="N">The first figure has only four legitimate moods. The major proposition
                    in this figure must be universal, and the minor affirmative; and it has this
                    property, that it yields conclusions of all kinds, affirmative and negative,
                    universal and particular.</p>
                <p part="N">The second figure has also four legitimate moods. Its major proposition
                    must be universal, and one of the premises must be negative. It yields
                    conclusions both universal and particular, but all negative.</p>
                <p part="N">The third figure has six legitimate moods. Its minor must always be
                    affirmative; and it yields conclusions both affirmative and negative, but all
                    particular. These are all the figures which were admitted by the inventor of
                    syllogisms, and of which, so far as we know, the number of legitimate moods has
                    been ascertained, and severally demonstrated. In <hi rend="italic">every
                        figure</hi> it will be found upon trial that there are <hi rend="italic"
                        >sixty four</hi> different moods of syllogism; and he who thinks it worth
                    while to construct so many in the <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> figure, always
                    remembering that the <hi rend="italic">middle term</hi> in each must be the <hi
                        rend="italic">predicate</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">major</hi> and the <hi
                        rend="italic">subject</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">minor</hi> proposition,
                    will easily discern what number of these moods are <hi rend="italic"
                        >legitimate,</hi> and evolve true conclusions.</p>
                <p part="N">Besides the rules which are proper to each figure, Aristotle has given
                    some that are common to all, by which the legitimacy of syllogisms may be tried.
                    These may be reduced to five, viz. 1. There must be only <hi rend="italic">three
                        terms</hi> in a syllogism; and as each term occurs in two of the
                    propositions, it must be precisely the <hi rend="italic">same in both</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> for if it be <hi rend="italic">not,</hi> the syllogism
                    is said to have <hi rend="italic">four terms,</hi> which makes a <hi
                        rend="italic">vicious</hi> syllogism. 2. The <hi rend="italic">middle
                        term</hi> must be taken <hi rend="italic">universally</hi> in <hi
                        rend="italic">one</hi> of the premises. 3. Both premises must <hi
                        rend="italic">not be particular</hi> propositions, nor both <hi
                        rend="italic">negative.</hi> 4. The <hi rend="italic">conclusion</hi> must
                    be <hi rend="italic">particular,</hi> if <hi rend="italic">either</hi> of the
                        <hi rend="italic">premises</hi> be <hi rend="italic">particular</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">negative,</hi> if <hi
                        rend="italic">either</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">premises</hi> be <hi
                        rend="italic">negative.</hi> 5. No term can be taken <hi rend="italic"
                        >universally</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">conclusion,</hi> if it be <hi
                        rend="italic">not</hi> taken <hi rend="italic">universally</hi> in the <hi
                        rend="italic">premises.</hi> For understanding the <hi rend="italic"
                        >second</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fifth</hi> of these rules, it is
                    necessary to observe, that a term is said to be taken <hi rend="italic"
                        >universally,</hi> not only when it is the <hi rend="italic">subject</hi> of
                    a <hi rend="italic">universal</hi> proposition, but also when it is the <hi
                        rend="italic">predicate</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">negative</hi>
                    proposition; and, on the other hand, a term is said to be taken <hi
                        rend="italic">particularly,</hi> when it is either the <hi rend="italic"
                        >subject</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> or the <hi
                        rend="italic">predicate of</hi> an <hi rend="italic">affirmative</hi>
                    proposition.</p>
                <p part="N">3. The division of syllogisms according to moods and figures respects
                    those especially which are known by the name of plain simple syllogisms; that
                    is, which are limited to three propositions, all of them simple, and where the
                    extremes and middle term are connected, according to the rules above laid down.
                    But as the mind is not tied down to any one precise form of reasoning, but
                    sometimes makes use of more, sometimes of fewer premises, and often employs
                    compound and conditional propositions, it may not be amiss to take notice of the
                    different forms derived from this source, and explain the rules by which the
                    mind conducts itself in the use of them.</p>
                <p part="N">4. When in any syllogism the major is a conditional proposition, the
                    syllogism itself is termed <hi rend="italic">conditional.</hi> Thus: “If there
                    be a God, he ought to be worshipped: But there is a God: Therefore he ought to
                    be worshipped.” In this example the major or first proposition is, we see,
                    conditional, and therefore the syllogism itself is also of the kind called
                    conditional. And here we must observe, that all conditional propositions are
                    composed of two distinct parts; one expressing the condition upon which the
                    predicate agrees or disagrees with the subject, as in this now before us, <hi
                        rend="italic">If there be a God</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the other
                    joining or disjoining the said predicate and subject, as here, <hi rend="italic"
                        >he ought to be worshipped.</hi> The first of these parts, or that which
                    implies the condition, is called the <hi rend="italic">antecedent;</hi> the
                    second, where we join or disjoin the predicate and subject, receives the name of
                    the <hi rend="italic">consequent.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">5. In all propositions of this kind, supposing them to be exact in point
                    of form, the relation between the antecedent and consequent must ever be true
                    and real; that is, the antecedent must always contain some certain and genuine
                    condition, which necessarily implies the consequent; for otherwise the
                    proposition itself will be false, and therefore ought not to be admitted into
                    our reasonings. Hence it follows, that when any conditional proposition is
                    assumed, if we admit the antecedent of that proposition, we must at the same
                    time necessarily admit the consequent; but if we reject the consequent, we are
                    in like manner bound to reject the antecedent. For as the antecedent always
                    expresses some condition which necessarily implies the truth of the consequent,
                    by admitting the antecedent, we allow of that condition, and therefore ought
                    also to admit the consequent. In like manner, if it appear that the consequent
                    ought to be rejected, the antecedent must evidently be so too; because, as has
                    just been demonstrated, the admission of the antecedent would necessarily imply
                    the admission likewise of the consequent.</p>
                <p part="N">6. There are two ways of arguing in <hi rend="italic">hypothetical</hi>
                    syllogisms, which lead to a certain and unavoidable conclusion; for, as the
                    major is always a conditional proposition, consisting of an antecedent and a
                    consequent, if the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207286?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-7286-0451"/>minor admit the antecedent, it is plain that
                    the conclusion must admit the consequent. This is called arguing from the
                    admission of the antecedent to the admission of the consequent, and constitutes
                    that mood or species of hypothetical syllogisms which is distinguished in the
                    schools by the name of the <hi rend="italic">modus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >ponens,</hi> inasmuch as by it the whole conditional proposition, both
                    antecedent and consequent, is established. Thus: “If God is infinitely wise, and
                    acts with perfect freedom, he does nothing but what is best: But God is
                    infinitely wise, and acts with perfect freedom: Therefore he does nothing but
                    what is best.”</p>
                <p part="N">Here we see that the antecedent or first part of the conditional
                    proposition is established in the minor, and the consequent or second part in
                    the conclusion; whence the syllogism itself is an example of the <hi
                        rend="italic">modus</hi><hi rend="italic">ponens.</hi> But if, on the
                    contrary, we suppose that the minor rejects the consequent, then it is apparent
                    that the conclusion must also reject the antecedent. In this case we are said to
                    argue from the removal of the consequent to the removal of the antecedent, and
                    the particular mood or species of syllogisms thence arising is called by
                    logicians the <hi rend="italic">modus</hi><hi rend="italic">tollens,</hi>
                    because in it both antecedent and consequent are rejected or taken away. This
                    will appear by the following example: “If God were not a Being of infinite
                    goodness, neither would he consult the happiness of his creatures: But God does
                    consult the happiness of his creatures: Therefore he is a Being of infinite
                    goodness.”</p>
                <p part="N">7. These two species include the whole class of conditional syllogisms,
                    and all the possible ways of arguing which lead to a legitimate conclusion;
                    because we cannot here proceed by a contrary process of reasoning, that is, from
                    the removal of the antecedent to the removal of the consequent, or from the
                    establishing of the consequent to the establishing of the antecedent. For,
                    although the antecedent always expresses some real condition, which, once
                    admitted, necessarily implies the consequent, yet it does not follow that there
                    is therefore no other condition; and if so, then, after removing the antecedent,
                    the consequent may still hold, because of some other determination which infers
                    it. When we say, “If a stone be exposed some time to the rays of the sun, it
                    will contract a certain degree of heat,” the proposition is certainly true; and,
                    admitting the antecedent, wc must also admit the consequent. But as there arc
                    various other ways by which a stone may become heated, it will not follow, from
                    the ceasing of the before-mentioned condition, that therefore the consequent
                    cannot take place. In other words, we cannot argue, “But the stone has not been
                    exposed to the rays of the sun; therefore neither has it any degree of heat;”
                    inasmuch as there arc a great many other ways by which heat might have been
                    communicated to it. And if we cannot argue from the removal of the antecedent to
                    the removal of the consequent, no more can we argue from the admission of the
                    consequent to the admission of the antecedent; because, as the consequent may
                    flow from a great variety of different suppositions, the allowing of it does not
                    determine the precise supposition, but only that some one of them must take
                    place. Thus, in the foregoing proposition, “If a stone be exposed some time to
                    the rays of the sun, it will contract a certain degree of heat;” admitting the
                    consequent, viz. <hi rend="italic">that it has contracted a certain degree of
                        heat,</hi> we arc not therefore bound to admit the antecedent, <hi
                        rend="italic">that it has been some time exposed to the rays of the
                        sun,</hi> because there are many other sources whence that heat may have
                    proceeded. These two ways of arguing, therefore, hold not in conditional
                    syllogisms.</p>
                <p part="N">8. As from the major being a conditional proposition, we obtain the
                    species of conditional syllogisms; so, where it is a disjunctive proposition,
                    the syllogism to which it belongs is also called <hi rend="italic"
                        >disjunctive,</hi> as in the following example: “The world is either
                    self-existent, or the work of some finite, or of some infinite Being: But it is
                    not self-existent, nor the work of a finite Being: Therefore it is the work of
                    an infinite Being.”</p>
                <p part="N">Now, a disjunctive proposition is that where, of several predicates, we
                    affirm one necessarily to belong to the subject, to the exclusion of all the
                    rest, but leave that particular one undetermined. Hence it follows, that as soon
                    as we determine the particular predicate, all the rest are of course to be
                    rejected; or if we reject all the predicates but one, that one necessarily
                    becomes effectual. When, therefore, in a disjunctive syllogism, the several
                    predicates are enumerated in the major, if the minor establishes any one of
                    these predicates, the conclusion ought to remove all the rest; or if, in the
                    minor, all the predicates but one be removed, the conclusion must necessarily
                    establish that one. Thus, in the disjunctive syllogism given above, the major
                    affirms one of the three predicates to belong to the world, viz. <hi
                        rend="italic">self-existence,</hi> or that it is <hi rend="italic">the work
                        of a finite,</hi> or that it is <hi rend="italic">the work of an irfinite
                        Being.</hi> Two of these predicates are removed in the minor, viz. <hi
                        rend="italic">self-existence,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the work of a
                        finite being.</hi> Hence the conclusion necessarily ascribes to it the third
                    predicate, and affirms that it is <hi rend="italic">the work of an infinite
                        Being.</hi> If now wc give the syllogism another turn, insomuch that the
                    minor may establish one of the predicates, by affirming the earth to be <hi
                        rend="italic">the production of an infinite Being,</hi> then the conclusion
                    must remove the other two, asserting it to be neither <hi rend="italic"
                        >self-existent,</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">the work of a finite Being.</hi>
                    These are the forms of reasoning in such species of syllogisms, the justness of
                    which appears at first sight; and that there can be no other, is evident from
                    the very nature of a disjunctive proposition.</p>
                <p part="N">9. In the several kinds of syllogisms hitherto mentioned, we may observe
                    that the parts are complete; that is, the three propositions of which they
                    consist are represented in form. But it often happens that some one of the
                    premises is not only an evident truth, but also familiar and in the minds of all
                    men, in which case it is usually omitted, whereby we have an imperfect
                    syllogism, which seems to be made up of only two propositions. Should we, for
                    instance, argue in this manner: “Every man is mortal: Therefore every king is
                    mortal the syllogism appears to be imperfect, as consisting but of two
                    propositions. Yet it is really complete; only the minor <hi rend="italic">[every
                        king is a man</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi> is omitted, and left to the
                    reader to supply, as being a proposition so familiar and evident that it cannot
                    escape him.</p>
                <p part="N">10. These seemingly imperfect syllogisms are called <hi rend="italic"

                    especially where it forms a part of common conversation. Nay, there is a
                    particular elegance in them, because, not displaying the argument in all its
                    parts, they leave somewhat to the exercise and invention of the mind. By this
                    means we are put upon exerting ourselves, and even seem to share in the

                    feels in composing. Besides, it shortens discourse, and adds a certain force and
                    liveliness to our arguments, when the words in which they are conveyed favour
                    the natural quickness of the mind in <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193207299?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7299-0452"/>its
                    operations, and a single expression is left to exhibit a whole train of
                    thoughts.</p>
                <p part="N">11. But there is another species of reasoning with two propositions,
                    which seems to be complete in itself, and where we admit the conclusion without
                    supposing any tacit or suppressed judgment in the mind, from which it follows
                    syllogistically. This happens between propositions where the connection is such
                    that the admission of the one necessarily and at the first sight implies the
                    admission also of the other; for if it so happens that the proposition upon
                    which the other depends is self-evident, we content ourselves with barely
                    affirming it, and infer the other by a direct conclusion. Thus, by admitting an
                    universal proposition, we are forced also to admit of all the particular
                    propositions comprehended under it, this being the very condition which
                    constitutes a proposition universal. If then that universal proposition chance
                    to be self-evident, the particular ones follow of course, without any further
                    train of reasoning. Whoever allows, for instance, <hi rend="italic">that things
                        equal to one and the same thing are equal to one another,</hi> must at the
                    same time allow, <hi rend="italic">that two triangles, each equal to a square
                        whose side is three inches, are also equal between themselves.</hi> This
                    argument, therefore, “Things equal to one and the same thing, are equal to one
                    another: Therefore these two triangles, each equal to the square of a line of
                    three inches, are equal between themselves,” is complete in its kind, and
                    contains all that is necessary towards a just and legitimate conclusion. For the
                    first or universal proposition is self-evident, and therefore requires no
                    further proof. And as the truth of the particular is inseparably connected with
                    that of the universal, it follows from it by an obvious and unavoidable
                    consequence.</p>
                <p part="N">12. Now, in all cases of this kind, where propositions are deduced one
                    from another, on account of a known and evident connection, we are said to
                    reason by immediate consequence. Such a coherence of propositions, manifest at
                    first sight, and forcing itself upon the mind, frequently occurs in reasoning.
                    Logicians have explained at some length the several propositions in which it
                    takes place, and allow of all immediate consequences which follow in conformity
                    to them. It is however observable, that these arguments, though seemingly
                    complete, because the conclusion follows necessarily from the single proposition
                    which goes before, may yet be considered as real enthymemes, whose major, which
                    is a conditional proposition, is wanting. The syllogism but just mentioned, when
                    represented according to this view, will run as follows: “If things equal to one
                    and the same thing are equal to one another, these two triangles, each equal to
                    a square whose side is three inches, are also equal between themselves. But
                    things equal to one and the same thing, are equal to one another: Therefore also
                    these triangles, &amp;c. are equal between themselves.”</p>
                <p part="N">This observation will be fσund to hold in all immediate consequences
                    whatsoever, insomuch that they arc in fact no more than the enthymemes of
                    hypothetical syllogisms. But then it is particular to them, that the ground on
                    which the conclusion rests, namely, its coherence with the minor, is of itself
                    apparent, and observed to flow immediately from the rules and reasons of
                    logic.</p>
                <p part="N">13. The next species of reasoning we shall take notice of here is what
                    is commonly known by the name of a <hi rend="italic">sorites.</hi> This is a way
                    of arguing, in which a great number of propositions are so linked together that
                    the predicate of one becomes continually the subject of the next following,
                    until at last a conclusion is formed, by bringing together the subject of the
                    first proposition, and the predicate of the last. Of this kind is the following
                    argument: “God is omnipotent: An omnipotent Being can do every thing that is
                    possible: He that can do every thing that is possible, can do whatever involves
                    not a contradiction: Therefore God can do whatever involves not a
                    contradiction.”</p>
                <p part="N">This particular combination of propositions may be continued to any
                    length we please, without in the least weakening the ground upon which the
                    conclusion rests. The reason is, because the sorites itself may be resolved into
                    as many simple syllogisms as there are middle terms in it; and this is found
                    universally to hold, That when such a resolution is made, and the syllogisms are
                    placed in train, the conclusion of the last in the series is also the conclusion
                    of the sorites. This kind of argument, therefore, as it serves to unite several
                    syllogisms into one, must stand upon the same foundation with the syllogisms of
                    which it consists, and is, indeed, properly speaking, no other than a
                    compendious way of reasoning syllogistically.</p>
                <p part="N">14. What is here said of plain simple propositions may be as well
                    applied to those that are conditional; that is, any number of them may be so
                    joined together in a series, that the consequent of one shall become continually
                    the antecedent of the next following; in which case, by establishing the
                    antecedent of the first proposition, we also establish the consequent of the
                    last, or by removing the last consequent, remove also the first antecedent. This
                    way of reasoning is exemplified in the following argument: “If we love any
                    person, all emotions of hatred towards him cease: If all emotions of hatred
                    towards a person cease, we cannot rejoice in his misfortunes: If we rejoice not
                    in his misfortunes, we certainly wish him no injury: Therefore, if we love a
                    person, we wish him no injury.” It is evident that this sorites, as well as the
                    last, may be resolved into a series of distinct syllogisms, with only this
                    difference, that here the syllogisms are all conditional.</p>
                <p part="N">15. The last species of syllogism which we shall take notice of under
                    this head is that commonly distinguished by the name of a <hi rend="italic"
                        >dilemma.</hi> A dilemma is an argument by which we endeavour to prove the
                    absurdity or falsehood of some assertion. In order to this, we assume a
                    conditional proposition, the antecedent of which is the assertion to be
                    disproved, and the consequent a disjunctive proposition, enumerating all the
                    possible suppositions upon which that assertion can take place. If then it
                    appears, that all these several suppositions ought to be rejected, it is plain
                    that the antecedent or assertion itself must be so too. When therefore such a
                    proposition as that before mentioned is made the major of any syllogism, if the
                    minor rejects all the suppositions contained in the consequent, it follows
                    necessarily that the conclusion ought to reject the antecedent, which, as we
                    have said, is the very assertion to be disproved. This particular way of arguing
                    is that which logicians call a <hi rend="italic">dilemmaς</hi> and from the
                    account here given of it, it appears that we may generally define it to be a
                    hypothetical syllogism, where the consequent of the major is a disjunctive
                    proposition, which is wholly taken away or removed in the minor. Of this kind is
                    the following: “If God did not create the world perfect in its kind, it must
                    either proceed from want of inclination or from want of power: But it could not
                    proceed either from want of inclination or from want of power: Therefore he
                    created the world perfect in its kind: Or, which is the same thing, It is absurd
                    to say that he did not create the world perfect in its kind.”</p>
                <p part="N">16. The nature, then, of a dilemma is universally this: The major is a
                    conditional proposition, whose consequent contains all the several suppositions
                    upon which the antecedent can take place. As therefore these suppositions are
                    wholly removed in the minor, it is evident that the antecedent must be so too,
                    insomuch that we here always argue from the removal of the consequent to the
                    removal of the antecedent; that is, a dilemma is an argument in the <hi
                        rend="italic">modus</hi><hi rend="italic">tollens</hi> of hypothetical
                    syllogisms, as logicians express it. Hence it is plain, that if the antecedent
                    of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207312?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-7312-0453"/>the major be an affirmative proposition, the
                    conclusion of the dilemma will be negative; but if it be a negative proposition,
                    the conclusion will be affirmative.</p>

                <p part="N">1. All reasoning is ultimately resolvable into first truths, which are
                    either self-evident or taken for granted; and the first truths of syllogistic
                    reasonings are <hi rend="italic">general</hi> propositions. But, except in the
                    mathematics, and such other sciences as, being conversant about mere ideas, have
                    no immediate relation to things without the mind, we cannot assume as truths
                    propositions which are general. The mathematician, indeed, may be considered as
                    taking his ideas from the beginning in their <hi rend="italic">general</hi>
                    form. Every <hi rend="italic">proposition</hi> composed of such ideas is
                    therefore general; and those which are theoretical are reducible to two parts or
                        <hi rend="italic">terms,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">predicate</hi> and a <hi
                        rend="italic">subject,</hi> with a <hi rend="italic">copula</hi> generally
                    affirmative. If the agreement or the relation between the two terms be not
                    immediate and self-evident, he has recourse to an <hi rend="italic">axiom,</hi>
                    which is a proposition still <hi rend="italic">more general,</hi> and which
                    supplies him with a third or <hi rend="italic">middle term.</hi> This he
                    compares, first with the <hi rend="italic">predicate,</hi> and then with the <hi

                        <hi rend="italic">conclusion,</hi> consisting of the terms of the question
                    proposed, is said to be demonstrated. This method of reasoning is conducted
                    exactly in the syllogistic form explained in the preceding chapter.</p>
                <p part="N">2. But in sciences which treat of things external to the mind, we cannot
                    assume as <hi rend="italic">first principles</hi> the most general propositions,
                    and from them infer others less and less general, till we descend to
                    particulars. The reason is obvious. Every thing in the universe, whether of mind
                    or body, presents itself to our observation in its individual state; so that <hi
                        rend="italic">perception</hi> and <hi rend="italic">judgment</hi> employed
                    in the investigation of truth, whether <hi rend="italic">physical, metaphysical,

                    original lights which, as they are the first and indispensable inlets of

                    safely admit the maxim with which logicians set out in the exercise of their
                    art, as the great hinge on which their reasoning and disputation turn: “From

                    state it more comprehensively, so as to apply to probable as well as to
                    scientific reasoning, “From truths which are better known, to deduce others
                    which are less known.” Philosophically speaking, syllogistic reasoning is. under

                    in the multiplication of false learning, and the invention and confirmation of
                    error. The truth of syllogisms depends ultimately on the truth of axioms, and

                <p part="N">1. Having concluded all that seemed necessary to be said in regard to
                    the two methods of direct reasoning, the <hi rend="italic">syllogistic</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">inductive,</hi> we now proceed to consider the laws of
                    demonstration. And here it must be acknowledged, that in strict demonstration,
                    which removes from the mind all possibility of doubt or error, the inductive
                    method of reasoning can have no place. When the experiments and observations
                    from which the general conclusion is drawn are numerous and extensive, the
                    result of this mode of reasoning is moral certainty; and if the induction could
                    be made complete, it would be absolute certainty, equally convincing with
                    mathematical demonstration. But however numerous and extensive the observations
                    and experiments may be upon which an inductive conclusion is established, they
                    must of necessity fall short of the number and extent of nature; which, in some
                    cases, by its immensity, will defeat all possibility of their co-extension,
                    whilst, in others, by its distance, it lies out of the reach of their immediate
                    application. Though truth does not appear in all other departments of learning
                    with that bold and resistless conviction with which it presides in the
                    mathematical sciences, it shines through them all, if not interrupted by
                    prejudice or perverted by error, with a clear and an useful though inferior
                    certainty. And as it is not necessary for the general safety or convenience of a
                    traveller, that lie should always enjoy the heat and splendour of a mid-day sun,
                    whilst he can with more ease pursue his journey under the milder influence of a
                    morning or an evening sky; so it is not requisite, for the various concerns and
                    purposes of life, that men should be led by truth of the most redundant
                    brightness. Such truth is to be had‘only in those sciences which are conversant
                    about abstract ideas of space and number, and their various relations, where
                    every thing being certainly what it appears to be, definitions and axioms arise
                    from mere intuition. Here <hi rend="italic">syllogism</hi> takes up the process
                    from the beginning, and by a sublime intellectual motion advances from the
                    simplest axioms to the most complicated speculations, and exhibits truth
                    springing out of its first and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207338?mode=fullsize"

                    into a system of science. As each step in the progress is syllogistic, we shall
                    endeavour to explain the use and application of syllogisms in this species of
                    reasoning.</p>
                <p part="N">We have seen, that in all the different appearances they assume, we
                    still arrive at a just and legitimate conclusion. Now, it often happens, that
                    the conclusion of one syllogism becomes a previous proposition in another; by
                    which means great numbers of them are sometimes linked together in a series, and
                    truths are made to follow one another in a train. And as in such a concatenation
                    of syllogisms all the various modes of reasoning which are truly conclusive may
                    be with safety introduced, hence it is plain,, that in deducing any truth from
                    its first principles, especially where it lies at a considerable distance from
                    them, we are at liberty to combine all the different kinds of syllogisms above
                    explained, according as they are found best suited to the end and purpose of our
                    inquiries. When a proposition is thus, by means of syllogisms, collected from
                    others more evident and known, it is said to be <hi rend="italic">proved·,</hi>
                    so that, in general, we may define the proof of a proposition to be a syllogism,
                    or series of syllogisms, collecting that proposition from known and evident
                    truths. But more particularly, if the syllogisms of which the proof consists
                    admit of no premises but definitions, self-evident truths, and propositions
                    already established, then is the argument so constituted called a <hi
                        rend="italic">demonstration</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whereby it appears
                    that demonstrations are ultimately founded upon definitions and self-evident
                    propositions.</p>
                <p part="N">2. All syllogisms whatsoever, whether compound, multiform, or defective,
                    are reducible to plain simple syllogisms in some one of the four figures. * But
                    this is not all. Syllogisms of the first figure, in particular, admit of all
                    possible conclusions; that is, in any propositions whatsoever, whether universal
                    affirmatives or universal negatives, particular affirmatives or particular
                    negatives, which fourfold division embraces all their varieties, the conclusion
                    may be inferred by virtue of some syllogism in the first figure. By this means
                    it happens that the syllogisms of all the other figures are reducible also to
                    syllogisms of the first figure, and may be considered as standing on the same
                    foundation with them. We cannot here demonstrate and explain the manner of this
                    reduction, because it would too much swell the bulk of this article. It is
                    sufficient to notice, that the thing is universally known and allowed amongst
                    logicians, to whose writings we refer such as desire further satisfaction in
                    this matter. This, then, being laid down, it is plain that any demonstration
                    whatsoever may be considered as composed of a series of syllogisms, all in the
                    first figure. For, since all the syllogisms that enter the demonstration are
                    reducible to syllogisms of some one of the four figures, and since the
                    syllogisms of all the other figures are further reducible to syllogisms of the
                    first figure, it is evident that the whole demonstration may be resolved into a
                    series of these last syllogisms. Let us now, then, if possible, discover the
                    ground upon which the conclusion rests in syllogisms of the first figure;
                    because, by so doing, we shall come at an universal principle of certainty,
                    whence the evidence of demonstrations in all their parts may be ultimately
                    deduced.</p>
                <p part="N">3. The rules, then, of the first figure are briefly these, !he middle
                    term is the subject of the major proposition, and the predicate of the minor.
                    The major is always an universal proposition, and the minor always affirmative.
                    Let us, now see what effect these rules will have in reasoning. Γhe major is an
                    universal proposition of which the middle term is the subject, and the predicate
                    of the conclusion the predicate. Hence it appears, that in the major the
                    predicate of the conclusion is always affirmed or denied universally of the
                    middle term. Again, the minor is an affirmative proposition, of which the
                    subject of the conclusion is the subject, and the middle term the predicate.
                    Here then the middle term is affirmed of the subject of the conclusion; that is,
                    the subject of the conclusion is affirmed to be comprehended under, or to form a
                    part of, the middle term. Thus, then, we see what is done in the premises of a
                    syllogism of the first figure. The predicate of the conclusion is universally
                    affirmed or denied of some idea. The subject of the conclusion is affirmed to be
                    or to form a part of that idea. Hence it naturally and unavoidably follows, that
                    the predicate of the conclusion ought to be affirmed or denied of the subject.
                    To illustrate this by an example, we shall resume one of the syllogisms of the
                    first figure. “Every creature possessed of reason and liberty is accountable for
                    his actions: Man is a creature possessed of reason and liberty; Therefore man is
                    accountable for his actions.”</p>
                <p part="N">Here, in the first proposition, the predicate of the conclusion, <hi
                        rend="italic">accountableness,</hi> is affirmed of all creatures possessed
                    of reason and liberty. Again, in the second proposition, <hi rend="italic"
                        >man,</hi> the subject of the conclusion, is affirmed to be or to form a
                    part of this class of creatures. Hence the conclusion necessarily and
                    unavoidably follows, viz. that man is accountable for his actions; because, if
                    reason and liberty be that which constitutes a creature accountable, and man has
                    reason and liberty, it is plain he has that which constitutes him accountable.
                    In like manner, where the major is a negative proposition, or denies the
                    predicate of the conclusion universally of the middle term, as the minor always
                    asserts the subject of the conclusion to be or form a part of that middle term,
                    it is no less evident that the predicate of the conclusion ought in this case to
                    be denied of the subject; so that the ground of reasoning, in all syllogisms in
                    the first figure, is manifestly this: Whatever may be affirmed universally of
                    any idea, may be affirmed of every or any number of particulars comprehended
                    under that idea. And again, Whatever may be denied universally of any idea, may
                    be in like manner denied of every or any number of its individuals. These two
                    propositions are called by logicians the <hi rend="italic">dictum de omni,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">dictum de</hi><hi rend="italic">mullo</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> and they are indeed the great principles of syllogistic
                    reasoning, inasmuch as all conclusions whatsoever rest immediately upon them, or
                    upon propositions deduced from them. But what adds greatly to their value is,
                    that they are really self-evident truths, and such as we cannot gainsay without
                    running into an express contradiction. To affirm, for instance, that <hi
                        rend="italic">no man is perfect,</hi> and yet to argue that <hi
                        rend="italic">some men are perfect</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or to say,
                    that <hi rend="italic">all men are mortal,</hi> and yet that <hi rend="italic"
                        >some men are not mortal</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> is to assert a thing
                    to be and not to be at the same time.</p>
                <p part="N">4. And now we may affirm, that, in all syllogisms of the first figure,
                    if the premises be true, the conclusion also must needs be true. If it be true
                    that the predicate of the conclusion, whether affirmative or negative, agrees
                    universally to some idea; and if it be also true that the subject of the
                    conclusion is a part of or comprehended under that idea; then it necessarily
                    follows, that the predicate of the conclusion agrees also to the subject. For to
                    assert the contrary, would be to run counter to some one of the two •principles
                    before established; that is, it would be to maintain an evident contradiction.
                    And thus we have come at last to the point we have been all along endeavouring
                    to establish; namely, that every proposition which can be demonstrated is
                    necessarily true. For as every demonstration may be resolved into a series of
                    syllogisms all in the first figure, and as in any one of these syllogisms, if
                    the premises are true, the conclusion must needs be so likewise, it evidently
                    follows, that if all the several premises are true, all the several conclusions
                    are so, and consequently also the conclusion of the last syllogism, which is
                    always the proposition to be demonstrated. Now, that all the premises of a
                    demonstration are true, will easily appear from the very <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193207351?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7351-0456"/>nature and
                    definition of that form of reasoning. A demonstration, as we have said, is a
                    series of syllogisms, all whose premises are either definitions, self-evident
                    truths, or propositions already established. Definitions are identical
                    propositions, in which we connect the description of an idea with the name by
                    whieh.we choose to have that idea called, and therefore as to their truth there
                    can be no dispute. Self-evident propositions appear true of themselves, and
                    leave no doubt or uncertainty in the mind. Propositions, before established, are
                    no other than conclusions gained by one or more steps from definitions and
                    self-evident principles, that is, from true premises, and therefore must needs
                    be true. Hence all the previous propositions of a demonstration being thus
                    manifestly true, the last conclusion, or proposition to be demonstrated, must
                    likewise be so; so that demonstration not only leads to certain truth, bút we
                    have here also a clear view of the ground and foundation of that certainty. For
                    as, in demonstrating, we may be said to do nothing more than combine a series of
                    syllogisms together, all resting on the same basis, it is plain that one uniform
                    ground of certainty runs through the whole, and that the conclusions are
                    everywhere built upon some one of the two principles before established, as the
                    foundation of all our reasoning. These two principles are easily reducible into
                    one, and may be expressed thus: Whatever predicate, whether affirmative or
                    negative, agrees universally to any idea, the same must needs agree to every or
                    any number of individuals comprehended under that idea. And thus at length we
                    have, according to our first design, reduced the certainty of demonstration to
                    one simple and universal principle, which carries its own evidence along with
                    it, and which is indeed the ultimate foundation of all syllogistic
                    reasoning.</p>
                <p part="N">5. Demonstration, therefore, serving as an infallible guide to truth,
                    upon so s∖ιre and unalterable a basis, we may now venture to assert, that the
                    rules of logic furnish a sufficient criterion for the distinguishing between
                    truth and falsehood. For since every proposition that can be demonstrated is
                    necessarily true, he is able to distinguish truth from falsehood who can with
                    certainty judge when a proposition is truly demonstrated. Now, a demonstration,
                    as we have said, is nothing more than a concatenation of syllogisms, all the
                    premises of which are definitions, self-evident truths, or propositions
                    previously established. To judge, therefore, of the validity of a demonstration,
                    we must be able to distinguish whether the definitions that enter into it are
                    genuine, and truly descriptive of the ideas they are meant to exhibit; whether
                    the propositions assumed without proofs as intuitive truths have really that
                    self-evidence to which they lay claim; whether the syllogisms are drawn up in
                    due form, and agreeably to the laws of argumentation; in fine, whether they are
                    combined together in a just and orderly manner, so that no demonstrable
                    propositions serve anywhere as premises unless they are the conclusions of
                    previous syllogisms. Now, it is the business of logic, in explaining the several
                    operations of the mind, fully to instruct us in all these points. It teaches the
                    nature and end of definitions, and lays down the rules by which these ought to
                    be framed. It unfolds the several species of propositions, and distinguishes the
                    self-evident from the demonstrable. It delineates also the different forms of
                    syllogisms, and explains the laws of argumentation proper to each. In fine, it
                    describes the manner of combining syllogisms, so that they may form a train of
                    reasoning, and lead to the successive discovery of truth. The precepts of logic,
                    therefore, as they enable us to judge with certainty when a proposition is duly
                    demonstrated, furnish a sure criterion for the distinguishing between truth and
                    falsehood.</p>
                <p part="N">6. Perhaps it may be objected, that demonstration is a thing very rare
                    and uncommon, as being the prerogative of but a few sciences, and therefore the
                    criterion here given can be of no great use. But wherever, by the bare
                    contemplation of our ideas, truth is discoverable, there also demonstration may
                    be attained. Now that is an abundantly sufficient criterion which enables us to
                    judge with certainty in all cases where the knowledge of truth comes within our
                    reach; for with discoveries that lie beyond the limits of the human mind we have
                    properly no sort of business or concern. When a proposition is demonstrated, we
                    are certain of its truth. When, on the contrary, our ideas are such as have no
                    visible connection or repugnance, and therefore furnish not the proper means of
                    tracing their agreement or disagreement, there we are sure that scientifical
                    knowledge is not attainable. But where there is some foundation of reasoning,
                    which yet amounts not to the full evidence of demonstratioh, there the precepts
                    of logic, by teaching us to determine aright the degree of proof, and discern
                    what is still wantihg to render it full and complete, enable us to make a due
                    estimate of the measures of probability, and to proportion our assent to the
                    grounds upon which the proposition stands. Ahd this is all we can possibly
                    arrive at, or even so much as hope for, in the exercise of faculties so
                    imperfect and limited as ours.</p>
                <p part="N">7. Before we conclude this branch of the subject, it may not be improper
                    to take notice of the distinction of demonstration into <hi rend="italic"
                        >direct</hi> and <hi rend="italic">indirect.</hi> A <hi rend="italic">direct
                        demonstration</hi> is, when, beginning with definitions, self-evident
                    propositions, or known and admitted truths, we form a train of syllogisms, and
                    combine them in an orderly manner, continuing the series through a variety of
                    successive steps, until at last we arrive at a syllogism the conclusion of which
                    is the proposition to be demonstrated. Proofs of this kind leave no doubt or
                    uncertainty behind them; because, all the several premises being true, the
                    conclusions must likewise be so, and of course the very last conclusion or
                    proposition to be proved. The other species of demonstration is the <hi
                        rend="italic">indirect,</hi> or, as it is sometimes called, the <hi
                        rend="italic">apogogical.</hi> The manner of proceeding here is, by assuming
                    a proposition which directly contradicts that which we mean to demonstrate; and
                    thence, by a continued train of reasoning, in the way of a direct demonstration,
                    deducing from it some absurdity or manifest untruth. For hereupon we conclude
                    that the proposition assumed was false, and thence again, by an immediate
                    consequence, that the proposition to be demonstrated is true. Thus Euclid, in
                    his third book, having to demonstrate <hi rend="italic">that circles wlũch touch
                        one another inwardly have not the same centre,</hi> assumes the direct
                    contrary of this, viz. <hi rend="italic">that they have the same centre;</hi>
                    and thence, by an evident train of reasoning, proves <hi rend="italic">that a
                        part is equal to the whole.</hi> The supposition therefore leading to this
                    absurdity he concludes to be false, viz. <hi rend="italic">that circles touching
                        one another inwardly have the same centre</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    thence again immediately infers, <hi rend="italic">that they have not the same
                        centre.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">8. Now, because this manner of demonstration is accounted by some not
                    ’altogether so clear and satisfactory, we shall therefore endeavour to show that
                    it equally with the other leads to truth and certainty. Two propositions are
                    said to be <hi rend="italic">contradictory</hi> of one another, when that which
                    is asserted to be in the one is asserted not to be in the other. Thus the
                    propositions, “Circles that touch one another inwardly have the same centre,”
                    and “Circles that touch one another inwardly have not the same centre,” are <hi
                        rend="italic">contradictories,</hi> because the second asserts directly the
                    contrary of that which is asserted in the first. Now, in all contradictory
                    propositions, this holds universally, that one of them is necessarily true, and
                    the other necessarily false. For if it be true that circles which touch one
                    another inwardly have not the same centre, it is unavoidably false that they
                    have the same centre. On the other hand, if it be false that they have the same
                    centre, it is necessarily true that they have not the same centre. Since,
                    therefore, it is impossible for them both to be true or both false at <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193207364?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7364-0457"
                    />the same time, it unavoidably follows that one is necessarily true and the
                    other necessarily false. This, then, being alΓowed, which indeed is
                    self-evident, if any two contradictory propositions are assumed, and one of them
                    can by a clear train of reasoning be demonstrated to be false, it necessarily
                    follows tfiat the other is true. For as the one is necessarily true, and the
                    other necessarily false, when we come to discover which is the false
                    proposition, we thereby know the other to be true.</p>
                <p part="N">9. Now this is precisely the manner of an indirect demonstration, as is
                    evident from the account which has been given of it above. For there we assume a
                    proposition directly contradictory of that which we mean to demonstrate; and,
                    having by a continued series of proofs shown it to be false, we thence infer
                    that it is contradictory, or that the proposition to be demonstrated is true.
                    As, therefore, this last conclusion is certain and unavoidable, let us next
                    inquire after what manner we come to be satisfied of the falsehood of the
                    assumed proposition, that so no possible doubt may remain as to the force and
                    validity of demonstrations of this kind. The manner, then, is plainly this:
                    Beginning with the as- <hi rend="smallcaps">í</hi> sumed proposition, we, by the
                    help of definitions, self-evident truths, or propositions already established,
                    continue a series of reasoning, in the way of a direct demonstration, until at
                    length we arrive at some absurdity or known falsehood. Thus Euclid, in the
                    example before mentioned, from the supposition that circles touching one another
                    inwardly have the same centre, deduces the inference <hi rend="italic">that a
                        part is equal to the whole.</hi> Since, therefore, by a due and orderly
                    process of reasoning we come at last to a false conclusion, it is manifest that
                    all the premises cannot be true; for, were all the premises true, the last
                    conclusion must: likewise be so, by what has been before demonstrated. Now, as
                    to all the other premises made use of in the course of reasoning, they are by
                    supposition manifest and known truths, being either definitions, self-evident
                    propositions, or truths previously established. The assumed proposition is. that
                    only as to which any doubt or uncertainty remains. That alone, therefore, can be
                    false; and, indeed, from what has been already shown, it must unavoidably be so.
                    And thus we see that, in indirect demonstrations, two contradictory propositions
                    being laid down, one of which is demonstrated to be false, the other, which is
                    always the proposition to be proved, must necessarily be true; so that here, as
                    well as in the direct mode of proof, we arrive at a clear and satisfactory
                    knowledge of truth.</p>
                <p part="N">10. This is universally the method of reasoning in all apogogical or
                    indirect demonstrations. But if any proposition is assumed, from which, in a
                    direct train of reasoning, we can deduce its contradictory, the proposition so
                    assumed is false, and the contradictory one true. For if we suppose the assumed
                    proposition to be true, then, since all the other premises that enter the
                    demonstration are also true, we shall have a series of reasoning consisting
                    wholly of true premises; and hence the last conclusion or contradictory of the
                    assumed proposition must be true likewise; so • that by this means we should
                    have two contradictory propositions both true at the same time, which is
                    manifestly impossible. The assumed proposition, therefore, whence, this
                    absurdity flows, must necessarily be false; and consequently its contradictory,
                    which is here the proposition deduced from it, must be true. If, then, any
                    proposition is proposed to be demonstrated, and we <hi rend="italic">assume</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">contradictory</hi> of that proposition, and thence
                    directly infer the proposition to be demonstrated, by this very means we know
                    tlιat the proposition so inferred is true. For, since from an assumed
                    proposition we have deduced its contradictory, we are thereby certain that the
                    assumed proposition must be false; and if so, then its contradictory, or that
                    deduced from it, which in this case is the same with the proposition to be
                    demonstrated, must be true.</p>
                <p part="N">11. We have a curious instance of this in the twelfth proposition of the
                    ninth book of the Elements. Euclid there proposes to demonstrate, <hi
                        rend="italic">that in a</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> η</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">g series of numbers, rising from unity in geometrical
                        progression, all the prime numbers that measure the last term in tìie series
                        will also measure the next after unity.</hi> In order to this, he assumes
                    the contradictory of the proposition to be demonstrated, namely, <hi
                        rend="italic">that some prime number measuring th</hi><hi rend="italic
                        subscript"> e</hi><hi rend="italic">last, term in the series does not
                        measure the next after unity</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and thence, by a
                    continued train of reasoning, proves that it actually does measure it. Hereupon
                    he concludes that the assumed proposition is false; and that that which is
                    deduced from it, or its contradictory, which is the. very proposition he
                    proposed to demonstrate, is true. Now that this is a just and conclusive way of
                    reasoning, seems abundantly manifest from what has been so clearly established
                    above. Whence it appears how necessary some knowledge of the rules of logic is
                    to enable us to judge of the force, justness, and validity of demonstrations.
                    For though it is readily allowed that, by the mere strength of our natural
                    faculties: we can at once discern, that of two contradictory propositions, the
                    one is necessarily true and the other necessarily· false, yet when they are so
                    linked together in a demonstration as that the one serves as a previous
                    proposition whence the other is deduced, it does not so immediately appear,
                    without some knowledge of the principles of logic, why that alone, which is
                    collected by reasoning, ought to be embraced as true, and the other, whence it
                    is collected, should be rejected as false.</p>
                <p part="N">12. Having thus sufficiently evinced the certainty of demonstration in
                    all its branches, and shown the rules by which we ought to proceed in order to
                    arrive at a just conclusion according to the various ways of arguing made use
                    of, it is needless to enter upon a particular consideration of those several
                    species of false reasoning which logicians distinguish by the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">sophisms.</hi> He who thoroughly understands the form and
                    structure of a good argument, will of himself readily discern every deviation
                    from it. And although <hi rend="italic">sophisms</hi> have been divided into
                    many classes, which are all called by sounding names, that carry in them much
                    appearance of learning, yet are the errors themselves so very palpable and
                    obvious, that it would be lost labour to write for a man capable of being misled
                    by them. Here, therefore, we choose to conclude this part of logic, and shall in
                    the next give some account of <hi rend="italic">Method,</hi> which, though
                    inseparable from reasoning, is nevertheless always considered by logicians as a
                    distinct operation of the mind, because its influence is not confined to the
                    mere exercise of the reasoning faculty, but extends in some degree to all the
                    transactions of the understanding.</p>
                <p part="N">IV.—OF METHOD.</p>
                <p part="N">We have now done with the three first operations of the mind, whose
                    office it is to search after truth, and enlarge the bounds of human knowledge.
                    There is yet a fourth, which regards the disposal and arrangement of our
                    thoughts, when we endeavour so to put them together that their mutual connection
                    and dependence may be clearly seen. This is what logicians called <hi
                        rend="italic">Method,</hi> and place always the last in order in explaining
                    the powers of the understanding, because it necessarily supposes a previous
                    exercise of our other faculties, and that some progress has been made in
                    knowledge, before we can exert it in any extensive degree.</p>
                <p part="N">2. In this view it is plain that we must be beforehand well acquainted
                    with the truths which we are to combine together, otherwise, how could we
                    discern their several connections and relations, or so dispose of them as their
                    mutual dependence may. require? But it often happens that <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193207377?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7377-0458"/>the
                    understanding is employed, not in the arrangement and composition of known
                    truths, but in the search and discovery of such as are unknown. And here the
                    manner of proceeding is very different. We assemble at once our whole stock of
                    knowledge relating to any subject, and, after a general survey of things, begin
                    with examining them separately and by parts. Hence it comes to pass, that
                    although at our first setting out we were only acquainted with some of the
                    grander strokes and outlines of truth, by thus pursuing her through her several
                    windings and recesses we gradually discover those more inward and finer touches
                    whence she derives all her strength, symmetry, and beauty. And here it is that
                    when, by a narrow scrutiny into things, we have unravelled any part of
                    knowledge, and traced it to its first and original principles, insomuch that the
                    whole frame and contexture of it lies open to the view of the mind; here it is
                    that, taking it the contrary way, and beginning with these principles, we can so
                    adjust and put together the parts as the order and method of science
                    requires.</p>
                <p part="N">3. But as these things are best understood when illustrated by examples,
                    let us suppose any machine, for instance a watch, presented to us, the structure
                    and composition of which we are as yet unacquainted with, but want, if possible,
                    to discover. The manner of proceeding, in this case, is, by taking the whole to
                    pieces, and examining the parts separately one after another. When by such a
                    scrutiny we have thoroughly informed ourselves of the frame and contexture of
                    each, we then compare them together, in order to judge of their mutual action
                    and influence. By this means we gradually trace out the inward make and
                    composition of the whole, and come at length to discern how parts of such a
                    form, and so put together as we found in unravelling and taking them asunder,
                    constitute that particular machine called a <hi rend="italic">watch,</hi> and
                    contribute to all the several motions and phenomena observable in it. This
                    discovery being made, we can take things the contrary way, and, beginning with
                    the parts, so dispose and connect them as their several uses and structures
                    require, until at length wc arrive at the whole itself, from the unravelling of
                    whieh those parts resulted.</p>
                <p part="N">4. And as it is in tracing and examining the works of art, so is it in a
                    great measure in unfolding any part of human knowledge; for the relations and
                    mutual habitudes of things do not always immediately appear upon comparing them
                    one with another. Hence we have recourse to intermediate ideas, and by means of
                    them are furnished with those previous propositions which lead to the conclusion
                    we are in quest of. And if it so happen that the previous propositions
                    themselves are not sufficiently evident, we endeavour by new middle terms to
                    ascertain their truth, still tracing things backwards in a continual series,
                    until at length we arrive at some syllogism where the premises are first and
                    self-evident principles. This being done, we become perfectly satisfied as to
                    the truth of all the conclusions we have passed through, inasmuch as they are
                    now seen to stand upon the firm and immoveable foundation of our intuitive
                    perceptions. And as we arrived at this certainty by tracing things backwards to
                    the original principles whence they flow, so may we at any time renew it by a
                    directly contrary process, if, beginning with these principles, we carry the
                    train of our thoughts forward until they lead us, by a connected chain of
                    proofs, to the very last conclusion of the series.</p>
                <p part="N">5. Hence it appears, that in disposing and putting together our
                    thoughts, either for our own use, that the discoveries we have made may at all
                    times lie open to the review of the mind, or where we mean to communicate and
                    unfold these discoveries to others, there are two ways of proceeding equally
                    within our choice; for we may propose the truths relating to any part of
                    knowledge, as they presented themselves to the mind in the manner of
                    investigation, carrying on the series of proofs in a reverse order, until they
                    at last terminate in first principles; or, beginning with these principles, we
                    may take the contrary way, and from them deduce, by a direct train of reasoning,
                    the several propositions which we want to establish. This diversity in the
                    manner of arranging our thoughts gives rise to the twofold division of method
                    established amongst logicians; for method, according to their use of the word,
                    is nothing else but the order and disposition of our thoughts relating to any
                    subject. When truths are proposed and put together as they were or might have
                    been discovered, this is called the <hi rend="italic">analytical method,</hi> or
                    the <hi rend="italic">method of resolution</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> inasmuch
                    as it traces things backwards to their source, and resolves knowledge into its
                    first and elementary principles. When, on the other hand, they are deduced from
                    these principles, and connected according to their mutual dependence, insomuch
                    that the truths first in order tend always to the demonstration of those which
                    follow, this constitutes what we call the <hi rend="italic">synthetical
                        method,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">method of composition</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> for here we proceed by gathering together the several
                    scattered parts of knowledge, and combining them into one whole or system, in
                    such manner that the understanding is enabled distinctly to follow truth through
                    all her different stages and gradations.</p>
                <p part="N">6. There is this further to be taken notice of in relation to these two
                    species of method, that the first has also obtained the name of the <hi
                        rend="italic">method of invention,</hi> because it observes the order in
                    which our thoughts succeed one another in the invention or discovery of truth.
                    The other, again, is often denominated the <hi rend="italic">method of
                        doctrine</hi> or <hi rend="italic">instruction,</hi> inasmuch as, in laying
                    our thoughts before others, we generally choose to proceed in the synthetic
                    manner, deducing them from their first principles. For we have to observe, that
                    although there is great pleasure in pursuing truth in the method of
                    investigation, because it places us in the condition of the inventor, and shows
                    the particular train and process of thinking by which he arrived at his
                    discoveries, yet it is not so w ell accommodated to the purposes of evidence and
                    conviction. At our first setting out, we are commonly unable to divine where the
                    analysis will lead us, insomuch, indeed, that our researches are for some time
                    little better than a mere groping in the dark. And even after light begins to
                    break in upon us, we are still obliged to make many reviews, and a frequent
                    comparison of the several steps of the investigation amongst themselves. Nay,
                    when we have unravelled the whole, and reached the very foundation upon which
                    our discoveries stand, all our certainty, in regard to their truth, will be
                    found in a great measure to arise from that connection which we are now able to
                    discern between them and first principles, taken in the order of composition.
                    But in the synthetical manner of disposing our thoughts, the case is quite
                    different. For, as we here begin with the intuitive truths, and advance by
                    regular deductions from them, every step of the procedure brings evidence and
                    conviction along w ith it; so that, in our progress from one part of knowledge
                    to another, we have always a clear perception of the ground upon w hich our
                    assent rests. In communicating our discoveries to others, therefore, this method
                    is apparently to be chosen, as it wonderfully improves and enlightens the
                    understanding, and leads to an immediate perception of truth.</p>

                    was deemed the most important of the sciences, has long been condemned as a mere
                    art of wrangling, of very little use in the search after truth. Attempts have
                    been made to restore it to credit, but without success; and for a considerable

                    'fruit of much time and labour; and it is universally known that the later
                    writers on the art have borrowed their materials almost entirely from his <hi
                        rend="italic">Organon</hi> and Porphyry’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Introduction.</hi> But after men had laboured nearly two thousand years in
                    search of truth by the help of syllogisms, Lord Bacon proposed the method of
                    induction as a more effectual engine for that purpose; and since his days the
                    science of logic has gradually and undeservedly fallen into disrepute.</p>
                <p part="N">To this effect a variety of causes have contributed. The syllogistic art
                    is admirably calculated for wrangling; and by the schoolmen it was employed with
                    but too much success to keep’jn countenance the absurdities of the scholastic
                    phi-ilosophy. Under their management it produced numberless disputes and
                    numberless sects, who fought against each other with much animosity, without
                    gaining or losing ground; but it did nothing considerable for the benefit of
                    human life, whilst the method of induction has improved arts and increased
                    knowledge. It is no wonder, therefore, that the excessive admiration of
                    Aristotle, which continued for so many ages, should end in an undue contempt;
                    and that the high esteem of logic, as the grand engine of science, should at
                    last make way for the too unfavourable opinion which now seems prevalent, of its
                    being unworthy of a place in a liberal education. Men rarely leave one extreme
                    without running into the opposite. They who think according to the fashion of
                    the time, will be as prone to go into the present extreme as their grandfathers
                    were to go into the former; and even they who in general think for themselves,
                    when they are offended at the abuse of any thing, are too apt to entertain
                    prejudices against the <hi rend="italic">thing itself.</hi> “In practice,” says
                    Bishop Warburton,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p
                            part="N">Introduction to Julian, &amp;c.</p></note> “logic is more a <hi

                    rather to amuse than instruct. And in some sort we may apply to the art of
                    syllogism what a man of wit says of rhetoric, that it only tells us how to <hi
                        rend="italic">name</hi> those tools which nature had before put into our
                    hands. In the service of chicane, indeed, it is a mere juggler’s knot, now fast,
                    now loose; and the schools where this legerdemain was exercised in great
                    perfection are full of the stories of its wonders.” The authority of Warburton
                    is great, but it may be counterbalanced by another, which, on subjects of this
                    nature, is confessedly greater.</p>
                <p part="N">“Laying aside prejudice, whether fashionable or unfashionable, let us
                    consider,” says Dr Reid,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p
                            part="N">Appendix to Lord Kames’s Sketch on the Principles and Progress

                    any good purpose. Its professed end is to teach men to think, to judge, and to
                    reason with precision and accuracy. No man will say this is a matter of little
                    importance; the only thing there-Ííore that can admit of doubt is, whether it
                    can be taught?</p>
                <p part="N">“To resolve this doubt, it may be observed, that our rational faculty is
                    the gift of God, given to men in very different measures. Some have a large
                    portion, some a less; and where there is a remarkable defect of the natural
                    power, it cannot be supplied by any culture. But this natural power, even where
                    it is the strongest, may lie dead I for want of the means of improvement. Many a
                    savage τ&gt;ay have been born with as good faculties as a Newton, a Bacon, or an
                    Aristotle; but their talents were buried by ιaving never been put to use, whilst
                    those of the philosophers were cultivated to the best advantage. It may like
                    wise be observed, that the chief mean of improving our rational power, is the
                    vigorous exercise of it in various ways, and on different subjects, by which the
                    habit is acquired of exercising it properly. Without such exercise, and good
                    sense over and above, a man who has studied logic all his life may be only a
                    petulant wrangler, without true judgment or skill of reasoning in any
                    science.”</p>
                <p part="N">This must have been Mr Locke’s meaning, when, in his Thoughts on
                    Education, he says, “If you would have your son to reason well, let him read
                    Chillingworth.” The state of things is much altered since Locke wrote. Logic has
                    been much improved chiefly by his writings; and yet much less stress is laid
                    upon it, and much less time consumed in its study, than formerly. His counsel,
                    therefore, was judicious and seasonable, viz. That the improvement of our
                    reasoning powers is to be expected much more from an intimate acquaintance with
                    the authors who reason best, than from studying voluminous systems of scholastic
                    logic. But if he had meant, that the study of logic was of no use, nor deserved
                    any attention, he surely would not have taken the pains to make so considerable
                    an addition to it, by his <hi rend="italic">Essay concerning Human
                        Understanding,</hi> and by his <hi rend="italic">Thoughts on the Conduct of
                        the Understanding</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> nor would he have remitted
                    his pupil to Chillingworth, the acutest logician as well as the best reasoner of
                    his age.</p>
                <p part="N">It must indeed be confessed, that a man without knowing the rules of
                    logic may acquire a habit of reasoning justly in <hi rend="italic"
                        >mathematics,</hi> and perhaps in any other science. Good sense, good
                    examples, and assiduous exercise, may bring a man to reason justly and acutely
                    in his own profession without rules. But whoever thinks, that from this
                    concession he may infer the inutility of logic, betrays by this inference a
                    great want of sense; for he might as well infer that, because a man <hi
                        rend="italic">may go</hi> from Edinburgh to London by the way of Paris,
                    therefore <hi rend="italic">any other</hi> road is useless.</p>
                <p part="N">There is perhaps no art which may not be acquired in a very considerable
                    degree, by example and practice, without reducing it to rules. But practice
                    conjoined with rules may carry a man forward in his art farther and more quickly
                    than practice without rules. Every ingenious artist knows the utility of having
                    his art reduced to rules, and thereby rendered a science. By rules he is
                    enlightened in his practice, and works with more assurance. They enable him
                    sometimes to correct his own errors, and often to detect the errors of others;
                    and he finds them of great use to confirm his judgment, to justify what is
                    right, and to condemn what is wrong. Now mathematics are the <hi rend="italic"
                        >praxis</hi> of <hi rend="italic">logic.</hi> Through them we may perceive
                    how the stated forms of syllogism are exemplified in one subject, namely, the
                    predicament of quantity; and by marking the force of these forms as they are
                    there applied, we may be enabled to apply them of ourselves elsewhere. Whoever,
                    therefore, shall study mathematics with this view, will become not only by
                    mathematics a more expert <hi rend="italic">logician,</hi> and by logic a more
                    rational <hi rend="italic">mathematician,</hi> but a wise philosopher, and an
                    acuter reasoner on all the possible subjects either of science or deliberation.
                    But when mathematics, instead of being applied to this excellent purpose, are
                    used, not to exemplify logic, but to supply its place, no wonder if logic should
                    fall into contempt, and if mathematics, instead of furthering science, should
                    become in fact an obstacle. For when men, knowing nothing of that reasoning
                    which is <hi rend="italic">universal,</hi> come to attach themselves for a
                    series of years to a <hi rend="italic">single species,</hi> a species wholly
                    involved in <hi rend="italic">lines</hi> and <hi rend="italic">numbers,</hi> the
                    mind becomes incapacitated for reasoning at large, and especially in the search

                    varying degree of moral evidence, requires the most enlarged and sovereign
                    exercise of reason.</p>
                <p part="N">In reasonings of this kind, will any man pretend that it is of no use
                    whatever to be well acquainted with the various powers of the mind by which we
                    reason? Is it of no use to resolve the various kinds of reasoning into their
                    simplest elements; and to discover, as far as we are able, the rules by which
                    these elements are combined in judging and in reasoning? Is it of no use to mark
                    the various fallacies in reasoning, by which even the most ingenious men have
                    been led into error? It must surely betray great want of understanding to think
                    these things useless or unimportant. Now these are the things which
                    logicianshave attempted; and which they have also executed, not indeed so
                    completely as to leave no room for improvement, but in such a manner as to give
                    very considerable aid to our reasoning powers. That the principles they have
                    laid down with regard to definition and division, the conversion and opposition
                    of propositions, and the general rules of reasoning, are not without use, is
                    sufficiently apparent from the blunders daily committed by those who disdain to
                    cultivate any acquaintance with them.</p>
                <p part="N">Although the art of categorical syllogism is confessedly little fitted
                    for the discovery of unknown truths, it may yet be employed to excellent
                    purposes, as it is perhaps the most compendious method of detecting a fallacy. A
                    man in quest of unknown truths, must generally proceed, by the method of
                    induction, from effects to causes; but he who as a teacher has to inculcate any
                    system upon others, begins with one or more self-evident truths, and proceeds,
                    in the way of demonstration, to the conclusion which he wishes to establish. Now
                    every demonstration, as has been already observed, may be resolved into a series
                    of syllogisms, of which the conclusion of the preceding always enters into the
                    premises of that which follows; and if the first principles be clear and
                    evident, and every syllogism in some legitimate mode and figure, the conclusion
                    of the whole must infallibly be admitted. But when the demonstration is thus
                    broken into parts, if we find that the conclusion of one syllogism will not,
                    without altering the meaning of the terms, enter legitimately into the premises
                    of that which should immediately follow; or, supposing it to make one of the
                    premises of a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> syllogism, if we find that the
                    conclusion resulting from the whole series <hi rend="italic">thus</hi> obtained,
                    is different from that of the demonstration; we may, in either of these cases,
                    rest assured that the author’s reasoning is fallacious, and leads to error; and
                    that if it carried an appearance of conviction before it was thus resolved into
                    its elementary parts, this must have been owing to the inability of the mind to
                    comprehend at <hi rend="italic">once</hi> a long train of arguments. Whoever
                    wishes to see the syllogistic art employed for this purpose, and to be convinced
                    of the truth of what we have said respecting its utility, may consult the
                    excellent writer recommended by Mr Locke, who, in places innumerable of his
                    incomparable book, has, without pedantry, even in that pedantic age, made the
                    happiest application of the rules of logic for unravelling the sophistry of his
                    Jesuitical antagonist.</p>
                <p part="N">Upon the whole, then, although we readily acknowledge that much time was
                    wasted by our forefathers in syllogistic wrangling, and what might with little
                    impropriety be termed the <hi rend="italic">mechanical</hi> part of logic, yet
                    the art of forming and examining arguments is certainly an attainment not
                    unworthy the ambition of a being whose highest distinction it is that he is
                    endowed with reason.</p>
                <p part="N">The preceding article was written at a period when some views in regard
                    .to the object and the end of logic were entertained in this country, which, in
                    the present state of the science, would be regarded as incorrect. The influence
                    of these views upon this treatise does not, however, affect its utility. They
                    are observable more in the <hi rend="italic">definition</hi> than in the <hi
                        rend="italic">treatment</hi> of the subject. It is, accordingly, sufficient
                    to correct the former, by showing what is the true scope and peculiar province
                    of logic, and to point out to the reader the more accessible sources to which he
                    may resort.</p>

                    peculiar method of reasoning, and that syllogism was ever intended as an
                    instrument of <hi rend="italic">discovery</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> had
                    afforded to these philosophers a ground on which they found no difficulty in
                    demonstrating the comparative inutility of the whole logical system of
                    Aristotle. Nor was the fallacy of their refutation soon exposed by detecting the
                    defect in its foundation. On the contrary, in this country, and in some others,
                    it was long admitted to be conclusive; and this admission in a great measure
                    determined the mode in which the subject was treated by the greater number of
                    those British authors who subsequently presented to the public what they
                    denominated systems of logic. Instead of showing that this science was only
                    undervalued for not effecting what it really did not propose to accomplish;
                    instead of showing that the end which it does propose is of high importance, and
                    is fully accomplished by this science, and by this science alone; and, instead
                    of rigorously excluding from their systems all not necessarily conducive to this
                    end; they, on the contrary, proposed to logic an end which no one science could
                    possibly accomplish; and in attempting this, they transmuted the most certain,
                    definite, and independent of the philosophical sciences, into a precarious
                    assemblage of foreign, incoherent, and insecure materials. Logic was regarded as
                    the doctrine which taught the art of using rightly our intellectual faculties in
                    the acquisition of knowledge; but as the promise here necessarily stood in
                    melancholy contrast with the performance, this false and exaggerated estimate of
                    the science only contributed .to sink still lower the humble opinion now
                    entertained of its importance.</p>
                <p part="N">Logic may be defined <hi rend="italic">the science of the laws of
                        thought, considered as thought.</hi> This is the central notion towards
                    which the various views of the science from Aristotle down wards gravitate; it
                    is the one definition, in which others, apparently the most opposite, find their
                    complement and reconciliation. This definition, however, requires some
                    elucidation.</p>
                <p part="N">In the first place, logic is said to be conversant about <hi

                    the mind, or subsequently suggested to its view. Logic is thus confined to the
                    discursive agency of mind in its three degrees of Apprehension, Judgment, and
                    Reasoning, to the exclusion of the subordinate operations of perception,

                        rend="italic">soniηg,</hi> are incorrect, inasmuch as, though the laws of
                    reasoning are the principal, they are not the adequate object of the science.
                    Those also are wrong who make logic proximately conversant about <hi
                        rend="italic">language,</hi> thus confounding it with grammar. We may,
                    however, with the schools, il-lustratively<pb break="no"

                    logic the <hi rend="italic">grammar of thought,</hi> as general grammar may
                    analogically be termed the <hi rend="italic">logic of speech.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">In the second place, logic is conversant about <hi rend="italic">thought
                        considered as thought.</hi> In every act of thinking we distinguish by
                    reflection two things: 1. the object of thought (the "matter); 2. the mode of
                    thinking it (the form). For example, when I think “This pen is bad,” the matter
                    of the thought is <hi rend="italic">the bad pen</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the
                        <hi rend="italic">form</hi> in which the matter is contained is <hi
                        rend="italic smallcaps"> ά</hi><hi rend="italic">judgment.</hi> Again, the
                    word “animal,” in so far as it is viewed as expressive of <hi rend="italic">a.
                        certain conceived multitude of living existences,</hi> is material; in so
                    far as it is considered as only significant of a <hi rend="italic"
                        >generalnotion,</hi> it is formal. This distinction of material and formal
                    in thought was also expressed by the schoolmen in the contrast of <hi
                        rend="italic">entia</hi><hi rend="italic">realm</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >entia rationis,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">notiones</hi> (intellecta,
                    conceptus, intentiones) <hi rend="italic">primae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >notiones</hi><hi rend="italic">secundae.</hi> This distinction is indeed
                    only a mental abstraction for the sake of science, as the matter and the form of
                    thought are in reality inseparable; for we are conscious of no object excepting
                    under some form of thought, and of no form of thought without a reference to
                    some determinate matter which constitutes the object of thought. Of these, the
                    matter is infinite in variety and number; the form, of few and determinate
                    modifications. Logic, therefore, can only consider the form of thought. For if
                    it took the matter into account, it must either take <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
                    objects indifferently, or only <hi rend="italic">some.</hi> On the former
                    principle, logic would be a treatise upon the <hi rend="italic">omne
                        scibile,</hi> a complement of all the sciences, which is impossible and
                    absurd ;½and upon the latter, no reason can be shown why certain objects should
                    be selected for consideration, to the exclusion of all others. But if we can
                    neither make all nor some objects of thought the object-matter of logic, it only
                    remains that we propose as its object-matter the form of thought itself; that
                    is, that we consider in logic, thought as thinking, to the neglect of the
                    particulars about which it thinks. Nor is this view of the province of logic any
                    novelty. In the schools, to say nothing of more recent philosophers, logic was
                    universally viewed as a <hi rend="italic">rational</hi> not a <hi rend="italic"
                        >real,</hi> as a <hi rend="italic">formal</hi> not a <hi rend="italic"
                        >material</hi> science; in other words, as conversant, not about <hi
                        rend="italic">things</hi> as conceived or known, but about the <hi
                        rend="italic">mode</hi> of conceiving and knowing them. Its object-matter
                    was thus by the schoolmen limited toe/zím <hi rend="italic">rαtwnis,</hi> in
                    contrast to <hi rend="italic">entia</hi><hi rend="italic">realia;</hi> to <hi
                        rend="italic">notiones</hi><hi rend="italic">secundae,</hi> in contrast to
                        <hi rend="italic">notiones</hi><hi rend="italic">primae</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">to things in general, in so far as
                        they stand under second notions, fyc.</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    expressions which, when rightly understood, manifest that those persons who
                    employed them held views, in regard to the scope and domain of the science, far
                    more accurate than those latterly prevalent, at least in this country.</p>
                <p part="N">In the third place, logic is the science of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >laws</hi> of thought. Logic, as we have seen, is solely conversant about
                    the faculty of thought, considered in its formal relation. But the forms of
                    thought can be made the object of consideration from two points of view. We can
                    either contemplate them as objects of mere <hi rend="italic">experience,</hi>
                    that is, delineate and arrange the special modifications of the thinking
                    principle, as facts of observation and history; or we may regard them as objects
                    of <hi rend="italic">speculation,</hi> that is, by means of reflection and
                    abstraction seek out and determine what, as necessary in each act of thinking,
                    affords the condition of the possibility of thought in general. The
                    consideration of the human mind, as an object of experience, belongs not to
                    logic, but to psychology. A knowledge, indeed, of the phenomena of mind, as
                    facts of experience, must chronologically precede their consideration as objects
                    of speculation; the philosophy of the human mind, as an empirical science, forms
                    therefore the natural preliminary of logic as a speculative science. Logic in
                    itself, however, constitutes not the less an independent and exclusive system.
                    For where the knowledge of our intellectual nature founded upon observation and
                    induction ends, and where, by an abstraction from all that experience affords of
                    particular and contingent, we ascend by reflection to the universal, and
                    necessary, and <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> conditions it involves, there the
                    domain of logic commences, and that of psychology, as a doctrine explanatory of
                    mere facts, terminates. But if logic be conversant about the universal and
                    necessary in thought, it is thereby conversant about the <hi rend="italic">laws
                        of thought.</hi> For the universal and necessary is only conceived as what
                    is determined by laws; and again, the very conception of a law involves the
                    universality and necessity of its application.</p>
                <p part="N">Logic is thus conversant, not about thought considered in itself, but
                    about thought viewed as subject to laws. Those therefore who, without
                    qualification, make the <hi rend="italic">operations or processes</hi> of the
                    discursive faculty the object of logic, are wrong; for logic considers these
                    only as governed by laws. Nor is this any modern observation. “To treat of
                    thoughts as thoughts,” says Simplicius, “is not the function of logic, but of
                    psychology.” Those schoolmen who held <hi rend="italic">entia rationis</hi> or
                        <hi rend="italic">notiones</hi><hi rend="italic">secundae</hi> to be the
                    object of logic, did not propose that these should be considered in themselves,
                    but only in their application to <hi rend="italic">entia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >realia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">notiones</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >primae,</hi> as the instruments and regulators of thought; whilst those
                    again who proposed all or some of the three intellectual operations for this
                    object, did so only in as far as these were <hi rend="italic">dirigible</hi> or
                    determinable by laws.</p>
                <p part="N">Thus the same correct viewof the science may be detected under forms of
                    expression which at first sight appear to be the most contradictory; and what we
                    have shown in regard to the schoolmen may be more easily proved in regard to the
                    Lcibnitzian and Kantian logicians. But though a right conception of the scope
                    and limits of logic must be allowed to have long and generally prevailed, it
                    must be acknowledged that the speculative notion did not in practice regulate
                    the contents and treatment of the science. From Aristotle downwards (the example
                    and authority of the Stagirite having mainly determined the practice of his
                    successors), the purity of the science has been, and is still, contaminated by
                    foreign infusions; and it is only by slow and painful efforts that one
                    extraneous doctrine after another has been banished from its domain. Thus,
                    though it has always been speculatively allowed that logic is exclusively
                    conversant with the form of thought; yet a consideration of the material
                    modality of propositions and syllogisms (a subject as useless as it is irksome)
                    remained, though often overlooked, an integral portion of the science, until it
                    was proved to be intrusive in the article on logic in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Edinburgh Review</hi> (vol. lvii. p. 220, <hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">seq.),</hi> and has accordingly, by subsequent writers on the
                    science, been formally expunged, as paralogical, from their systems, In this
                    country there is, however, no work on logic which displays the science in a pure
                    and perfect form; which evolves its doctrines from fundamental principles, and
                    displays its parts in that necessary connection and dependence, which
                    constitutes the elegance of a scientific system. Whately’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Elements of Logic</hi> is the English book which is best deserving of
                    attention. Though somewhat vague and vacillating in its views of the science,
                    and though its doctrines are neither developed from the primary laws of thought,
                    nor combined together as the essential parts of one necessary whole, yet it
                    displays a talent which shows that the author, with a more comprehensive
                    knowledge of his subject, might have produced a work not easily to be
                    superseded. There are also several minor works recently published on logic in
                    this country, not unworthy of consideration, a detailed estimate of which may be
                    seen in the Review previously referred to.</p>
