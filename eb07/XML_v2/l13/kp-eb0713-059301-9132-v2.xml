                    time as general, though v¢hout that title; Cromwell, who knew him to be
                    sin-cyely in the interest of the commonwealth, always findig out some pretext to
                    evade conferring that office upon hn. The last stroke would have been given by
                    Ludlow tithe Irish rebellion, if the usurpation of Cromwell had ñ| prevented it.
                    Under his power he never acted; and t⅛ugh Cromwell used his utmost efforts to
                    gain him, he ≡jained inflexible. After Cromwell’s death, he endeavored to
                    restore the commonwealth; but Charles II. be-iη recalled, he thought proper to
                    conceal himself, and es-Ci∣ed into Switzerland, where he settled. After the
                    re-vJution, he came over to England, in order to be employ-éiin Ireland against
                    King James; but having appeared píflicly in London, it gave great offence, and

                    King Charles I. l⅜n this he returned to Switzerland, where he died. Tiring his

                    nephew of Job above men-tiαed, was born at Erfurt in 1655. He came to Eng-lãní
                    as secretary to Μ. Lenthe, envoy from the court of Cd∣enhagen to that of London;
                    and being recommended to ’rince George of Denmark, he was received by that price
                    as his secretary. He enjoyed this office for some y⅛s, until he was
                    incapacitated by a violent disorder, whn he was discharged with a handsome
                    pension. After he ιad recovered, he travelled into Muscovy, where he was well
                    received by the czar, and where his knowledge led the ignorant Muscovite priests
                    to believe him a conjuror. On his return to London in 1694, he was cut for the
                    stone; and, as soon as his health would permit, in acknowledgment of the
                    civilities he received in Muscovy, he wrote a grammar of their language, that
                    the natives might learn their own tongue in a regular method. He then travelled
                    into the East, to inform himself of the state of the Christian church in the
                    Levant; the deplorable condition of which induced him, after his return, with
                    the aid of the Bishop of Worcester, to print an edition of the New Testament in
                    the vulgar Greek, in order to present it to the Greek church. In 1709, when such
                    numbers of Palatines came over to England, Mr Ludolph was appointed by Queen
                    Anne one of the commissioners to manage the charities raised for them; and he
                    died early in the following year. His collected works were published in
                    1712.</p>
