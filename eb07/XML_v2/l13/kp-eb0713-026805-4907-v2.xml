                    died in 1570, with the character of a well-bred gentleman. He wrote and
                    translated several pieces relative to history and antiquities, particularly the
                    History of Cambria, or Wales, from Caradoc of Langcarvan, which however, he did
                    not live to finish; but Sir Henry Sidney, lord-president of Wales, employed Dr
                    David Powel to complete it, and by him it was published in 1584. A new and
                    improved edition of this work was published in 1774.</p>

                    collection. With incessant labour and great exactness he employed a considerable
                    part of his life in searching into the Welsh antiquities, and perused or
                    collected a great deal of ancient and valuable matter from their manuscripts;
                    transcribed all the old charters of the monasteries that he could meet with;
                    travelled several times over Wales, Cornwall, Scotland, Ireland, and Armorica
                    (Bretagne), countries inhabited by the same people; compared their antiquities,
                    and made observations on the whole. But he died in July 1709, before he had
                    digested them into the form of a treatise, as he intended, on the ancient
                    inhabitants of this island. The untimely death of this excellent antiquary
                    prevented the completion of many admirable designs. For want of proper
                    encouragement, he .did very little towards illustrating the British bards,
                    having seen but one of those of the sixth century, and not being able to procure
                    access to two of the principal libraries in the country. He communicated many
                    observations to Bishop Gibson, whose edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >13ritannia</hi> he revised; and he published <hi rend="italic">Archoeologia
                        Britannica,</hi> giving some further account of the language, history, and
                    customs of the original inhabitants of Great Britain, from collections and
                    observations made in travels through Wales, Cornwall, Bretagne, Ireland, and
                    Scotland. He left in manuscript a Scottish or Irish-English Dictionary, proposed
                    to be published in 1732 by subscription, by Mr David Malcolm, a minister of the
                    church of Scotland, with additions; as also the Elements of the same Language,
                    with necessary and useful information, for propagating more effectually the
                    English language, and for promoting the knowledge of the ancient Scottish or
                    Irish, besides many branches of useful and curious learning. Lhuyd, at the end
                    of his preface to the <hi rend="italic">Archoeologia,</hi> promises an
                    historical dictionary of British persons and places mentioned in ancient
                    records; and it seems to have been ready for press, though he could not fix the
                    time of publication. His collections for a second volume, which was to give an
                    account of the antiquities, monuments, and remains, in the principality of
                    Wales, were numerous and well chosen; but, on account of a quarrel between him
                    and Dr Wynne, then fellow, and afterwards principal, of the college, and bishop
                    of St Asaph, he refused to buy them, and they were purchased by Sir Thomas
                    Sebright of Beachwood, in Hertfordshire. They consist of about forty volumes in
                    folio, ten in quarto, and above a hundred of smaller size, all relating to Irish
                    or Welsh antiquities, and chiefly in those languages. Carte made extracts from
                    them about 1736; but these were chiefly historical. Sir John Sebright gave to Mr
                    Pennant twenty-three of Lhuyd’s manuscripts, in Latin and English. Many of his
                    letters to Lister, and other learned contemporaries, were presented by Dr
                    Fothergill to the University of Oxford, and are now in the Ashmolean Museum.
