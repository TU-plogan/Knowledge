                <p part="N">The most ancient remains of writing which have been transmitted to us
                    are upon hard substances, such as stones and metals, which were used by the
                    ancients for edicts and matters of public notoriety. The decalogue was written
                    on two tables of stone; but this practice was not peculiar to the Jews, for it
                    was used by most of the eastern nations, as well as by the Greeks and Romans;
                    and therefore the ridicule which Voltaire attempts to cast upon that part of the
                    book of Genesis, where the people are commanded to write the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=984" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0984-0944"
                    />law on stones, is absurd; for what is there said by no means implies that
                    other materials might not be used on common occasions. The laws penal, civil,
                    and ceremonial, among ’ the Greeks, were engraven on tables of brass, which were
                    called <hi rend="italic">cgrbes.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">We find that wood was also used for writing on in different countries.
                    The Chinese, before the invention of paper, wrote or engraved with an iron tool
                    upon thin boards or on bamboo. Pliny says that table-books of wood were in use
                    before the time of Homer. These table-books were called by the Romans <hi
                        rend="italic">pugillares.</hi> The wood was cut into thin slices, and finely
                    plained and polished. The writing was at first upon the bare wood, with an iron
                    instrument called a <hi rend="italic">style.</hi> In latter times these tables
                    were usually waxed over, and written upon with that instrument. The matter
                    written upon the tables which were thus waxed over was easily effaced, and by
                    smoothing the wax new matter might be substituted in the place of what had been
                    written before. The Greeks and Romans continued the use of waxed table-books
                    long after the use of papyrus, leaves, and skins became common, because they
                    were so convenient for correcting extemporary compositions.</p>
                <p part="N">Table-books of ivory are still used for memorandums, but they are
                    commonly written upon with black-lead pencils. The practice of writing on
                    table-books covered with wax was not. entirely laid aside till the commencement
                    of the fourteenth century.</p>
                <p part="N">The bark of trees was also used for writing by the ancients, and is so
                    still in several parts of Asia. The same thing may be said of the leaves of
                    trees. It is needless to observe the use of parchment and vellum, papyrus and
                    paper, for writing; it is too well known. The method of fabricating these
                    substances has been already described as they occurred in the order of the
                    alphabet.</p>
                <p part="N">It is obvious, that when men wrote, or rather engraved, on hard
                    substances, instruments of metal were necessary, such as the chisel and the
                    stylus; but the latter was chiefly used for writing upon boards, waxed tablets,
                    or on bark.</p>
                <p part="N">When the ancients wrote on softer materials than wood or metal, other
                    instruments were used for writing with, of which reeds and canes seem to have
                    been the first. Reeds and canes are still used as instruments for writing with
                    by the Tartars, the Indians, the Persians, the Turks, and the Greeks. Pencils
                    made of hair are used by the Chinese for their writing: they first liquefy their
                    ink, and dip their pencils into it. Hair-pencils have likewise been used for
                    writing in Europe. Large capital letters were made with them from the time of
                    the Roman emperors till the sixteenth century. After the invention of printing
                    they were drawn by the illuminators. Quills of geese, swans, peacocks, crows,
                    and other birds, have been used in these western parts for writing with, but how
                    long is not easy to ascertain. Isidorus Hispalensis, or Isidore of Seville, who
                    lived about the middle of the seventh century, describes a pen made of a quill
                    as used in his time. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Bibliography</hi>, <hi
