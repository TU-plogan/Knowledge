                    and nearly in the centre of the kingdom. It is bounded on the western side, from
                    north to south, by Staffordshire, Worcestershire, and Gloucestershire; and on
                    the eastern side by Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, and Oxfordshire. Its
                    greatest length from north to south is about forty-eight, and its breadth across
                    the middle thirty-two miles. It contains 902 square miles, or 577,280 statute
                    acres. It is divided into four hundreds, besides the city of Coventry, which,
                    with its liberties, extends over about 18,000 acres. The hundreds are subdivided
                    into several smaller portions, for the local administration of the law, in which
                    petty sessions courts are held.</p>

                    having been as follows, viz., in 1801, 208,130; in 1811, 228,733; in 1821,
                    274,392; in 1831, 336,610. If the augmentation has proceeded with the same
                    rapidity as in the ten years from 1821 to 1831, it will be found at the
                    enumeration of 1841, that the inhabitants have been doubled in forty years.</p>
                <p part="N">The number of inhabited houses in 1831 was 68,253, comprising 72,357
                    families. Of those families, 15,880 were chiefly employed in agriculture; 43,291
                    were chiefly occupied in trade, manufactures, and handicraft; and 13,186 were
                    not comprised in either of the two preceding classes. The number of males twenty
                    years of age was 83,239; the occupiers of land employing labourers were 2838;
                    the occupiers of land not employing labourers, 1142; the labourers employed in
                    agriculture were 15,644. The persons employed in manufacture or in making
                    manufacturing machinery were 11,357; in retail trade, or in handicraft as
                    masters or workmen, 32,579; the capitalists, bankers, professional or other
                    educated men, 4012; the labourers in employments not agricultural, 10,358; the
                    other males twenty years of age (except servants), 3729; male servants under
                    twenty years of age, 3729; male servants more than twenty years of age, 1562;
                    those under twenty years of age, 884; and female servants of all ages,
                    13,089.</p>
                <p part="N">Although Warwickshire is an elevated district, it is in general level.
                    The rivers flow with a languid course, and the undulations of the surface are
                    rare and gentle. It is generally enclosed, and the fields are of moderate
                    extent. The fences are for the most part high and umbrageous, being thickly
                    planted with forest-trees, so that, though woods are rare, the face of the
                    country seems, at a distance, to be one continued tract of woodland. There are
                    but few common fields, and very little waste or barren land. The extent of
                    pasture land is greater than in most parts of England, and is estimated to be
                    more than half of the whole. The pasture land, calculated at 300,000 acres, may
                    be said wholly to be appropriated to the sustenance of the different species of
                    animals. 100,000 acres are annually mowed for hay, and the other two thirds are
                    used for feeding. The agriculture of the country is well conducted. The
                    cultivation of turnips is practised to a great extent, with much skill, and with
                    very productive effects. The crops of wheat, barley, oats, pease, beans, and
                    tares, are quite as luxuriant as in any portion of England. The cows are
                    generally of the long-homed kind, but among them there are many varieties. The
                    ancient breed of Warwickshire sheep has been crossed with the Leicester breed,
                    and this mixture has produced <hi rend="italic">a</hi> kind adapted to the land,
                    and equal to any race in the kingdom.</p>
                <p part="N">The streams of this county are numerous, out, with the exception of the
                    Avon, are inconsiderable; though, by the means of irrigation which they furnish,
                    they are of great value to its rural economy. The whole of them run directly or
                    indirectly to the Severn. The Avon is navigable for barges from Stratford to its
                    junction with that river near Tewkesbury. The intercourse of the county is much
                    facilitated by the numerous canals that intersect and connect it with every part
                    of England; supply every part with cheap fuel; and serve to convey its heavy
                    productions to the exporting towns, London, Liverpool, and Bristol. These canals
                    are the Birmingham Old Canal, the Birmingham and Fazeley, the Warwick and
                    Birmingham, the Worcester and Birmingham, the Coventry, the Warwick and Napton,
                    the Stratford, the Ashby de la Zeuch, and, above all, the Grand Junction. This
                    county, as it is the central one of the kingdom, is become also a focal point
                    for the most easy access from any one part of England to all the others. This
                    has arisen from the magnificent railroad completed since 1834. A daily
                    communication is by this great work kept up between London and the most distant
                    cities of the kingdom. It enters the county near Rugby, and passes through
                    Coventry to Birmingham, where it enters into Staffordshire; but in its passage
                    sends out, or will soon do so, branches to the midland counties, as well as by
                    Nottingham and Derby to York, from whence other branches will be formed to the
                    most distant parts of the kingdom.</p>
                <p part="N">The minerals and fossils of this county are coal, iron, limestone, and
                    freestone. At Leamington Priors are mineral springs, whose celebrity has made
                    that place one of the resorts of fashionable company, as well as invalids. The
                    waters contain neutral and sulphureous salts, with carbonate of iron. Owing to
                    the growing reputation of these waters, the town, which in 1801 contained only
                    500 inhabitants, is said now to have increased its population to 12,000, and its
                    beauty has similarly increased. The numerous objects of attraction near to it,
                    and the fertility and salubrity of the neighbourhood, have added to the growth
                    and prosperity of the place.</p>
                <p part="N">This county possesses considerable manufactories, of which the greatest
                    are those in metals of all kinds, conducted upon a stupendous scale at
                    Birmingham, and the towns and villages in its vicinity. The minute divisions and
                    subdivisions of labour, the various mechanical inventions, the discoveries in
                    chemistry, and the industrious and economical habits of the people, have
                    rendered this part of the country the principal reservoir from whence the world
                    is supplied with domestic utensils, ornaments, and a thousand minute articles
                    which add much to the comfort of civilized life. The city of Coventry has long
                    been celebrated for its manufactures of ribbons, and other goods of silk, which
                    now give occupation, in that place and its vicinity, to more than 15,000
                    pcrsons. There are also at Coventry large undertakings for making watches; a
                    trade that has of late been much extended. Mills for spinning cotton and wool
                    have been erected at Warwick; and to them is attributed the great increase which
                    has lately taken place in the population of that town. At Tamworth very large
                    works are constructed for printing calicoes. At Alcester, several hundred
                    persons are employed in making needles. In several parts of the county much
                    linen yarn is spun.</p>
                <p part="N">The most remarkable objects in the county are Kenilworth Castle, now in
                    a dilapidated state; Maxstoke Castle, a most extensive pile; Comb Abbey, a
                    Cistertian convent; the school-house at Rugby; and the house at Stratford in
                    which Shakspeare was born.</p>

                <p part="N">This county has furnished titles to two British peers, the earl of
                    Warwick and the earl of Coventry; and one Irish peer, Baron Arden. For election
                    purposes, the county is divided into two parts, distinguished as the northern
                    and southern. The election for the northern division is held at the town of
                    Coleshill; and the other polling places are Nuneaton, Coventry, Birmingham, and
                    Dunchurch. The election for the southern division is held at Warwick; and the
                    other polling places are Kineton, Stratford, Henley, and Southam. Two members
                    from Warwick, two from Coventry, and since the reform act two from Birmingham,
                    are sent to the House of Commons. Two are also sent from Tamworth, the largest
                    part of which is in the adjoining county of Stafford.</p>
