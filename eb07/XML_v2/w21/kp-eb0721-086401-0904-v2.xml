                    English counties. It is separated from the sea-shore by a narrow strip of the
                    county of Lancaster, which bounds it on the south and south-west, as do
                    Cumberland on the north and north-west, and Yorkshire on the east. It is of very
                    irregular shape. Its greatest length is forty, and its greatest breadth
                    thirty-five miles. According to the best estimate, it contains 762 square miles,
                    or 489,680 British statute acres. It is divided into four wards, distinguished
                    by the prefixes of East, Kendal, Lonsdale, and West, which are again divided
                    into thirty parishes.</p>
                <p part="N">The population of the several wards in 1831 was found to be, of the West
                    Ward, 7884; of the East Ward, 14,455; of Kendal Ward and Kendal Town, 27,252;
                    and of Lonsdale Ward, 5448.</p>
                <p part="N">The population of the whole county amounted in 1801 to 41,617, in 1811
                    to 45,922, in 1821 to 51,350, and in 1831 to 55,041. At the last-mentioned
                    period the males were 27,576, and the females 27,465. The dwelling-houses were
                    10,353, inhabited by 10,984 families.. Of the families, 4454 were chiefly
                    employed in agriculture; 4116 were chiefly employed in trade, manufactures, and
                    handicraft; and the remaining 2414 were comprised in neither of the preceding
                    classes. By the census of the same year, the number of males twenty years of age
                    was 14,020; the occupiers of land employing labourers, 1435; the occupiers of
                    land not employing*labourers, 1685; the labourers employed in agriculture, 3474;
                    persons employed in manufactures or making manufacturing machinery were 1074; in
                    retail trade or handicraft as masters or workmen, 3621; the capitalists,
                    bankers, professional, and other educated men were 602; the labourers in labour
                    not agricultural were 1195; the other males twenty years of age (except
                    servants), 746; male servants twenty years of age 188, and under twenty years
                    66; and the female servants 2576. This county is the least densely peopled of
                    any in England.</p>
                <p part="N">The greater part of the county consists of bleak and barren moors, and
                    groups of lofty and naked mountains. The valleys between these mountains,
                    through which the rivers wind, are of moderate fertility, and when well
                    cultivated yield good crops of oats, and in some few instances of wheat and
                    barley. The better parts of these valleys are appropriated to feed cattle or
                    produce hay. The acreable value of the land, in the whole of this county, is
                    much lower than that in any other part of England. According to the returns
                    under the income-tax, the average annual rent and tithes together did not exceed
                    8s. 7d. per acre, being about half the average value of the rest of the kingdom.
                    The romantic prospects, however, which are afforded by the contrast between the
                    mountains and the lakes, more than repay the traveller for rambling at his
                    leisure through the fine scenery. The lakes of Winandcrmere and Ulleswater are
                    partly in this county, and those of Grasmere and Hause Water, with several
                    smaller lakes, provincially called Tarns, wholly so. Besides the char (a fish
                    almost peculiar to these lakes), trouts, pikes, perch, and eels, are taken
                    abundantly in these waters.</p>
                <p part="N">The cattle of Westmoreland are of the long-horned kind, and attain a
                    large size when well fed. The butter they afford is highly valued, and supplies
                    to some extent the markets of the metropolis. Large flocks of sheep are fed on
                    the mountains, which yield a coarse wool; but by crossing the breed the wool of
                    late years has been much improved. Numbers of geese are fed on the moors, and
                    these, with hams, form a part of the exports of the county. Westmoreland is
                    nearly destitute of coals, and the metallic ores lie so deep, or are in so
                    remote situations, that there is none of them worked. Slates of the finest
                    quality are abundant, and large quantities of them are exported. Limestone is
                    also very plentiful.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal manufactures of the county are chiefly carried on at
                    Kendal, a place early celebrated for the woollen cloth which bore its name. This
                    manufacture, and that of linsey-woolsey, as well as of coarse worsted stockings,
                    are still continued; and considerable progress has recently been made in
                    introducing the making of cotton goods. It appears by the parliamentary returns,
                    that in 1831 the town of Kendal was in a state of such activity as to employ
                    between 500 and 600 males, upwards of twenty years of age, in making cotton
                    checks, kerseys, linseys, blanketing, and other goods. Woollen goods are made at
                    Kirkland and some other places, and gunpowder at Sedgwick and Long-dales, while
                    the cotton trade of Kendal and its vicinity has been remarkably extended.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal rivers are the Eden, the Lune, the Ken or Kent, and the
                    Lowther, which are more remarkable for the beauties displayed on their borders,
                    and for the abundance of fish they contain, than for any facilities they afford
                    to intercourse. None of them is navigable, nor are there any artificial
                    canals.</p>
                <p part="N">The county gives the title of earl to the family of the Fanes, and that
                    of Lonsdale to the Lowthers, and recently the title of Baron Brougham to the
                    head of the family of that name, and of Langdale to the Master of the Rolls. Two
                    members of the House of Commons are returned for the county. The town of Kendal
                    with its townships, and those of Kirkland and Nether Graveship, have been
                    created a borough by the reform law, and elect one member; and by the same law
                    the ancient borough of Appleby has been disfranchised.</p>
                <p part="N">The most remarkable seats of noblemen and gentlemen are the following:
                    Lowther Castle, earl of Lonsdale; Appleby Castle, earl of Thanet; Abbot Hall,
                    Christopher Wilson, Esq.; Mint House, J. H. Long, Esq.; Netherdale Hall, John
                    Mounsey, Esq.; Brougham Hall, Lord Brougham; Carlton Hall, Lord Wallace.</p>
                <p part="N">The town of Kendal contains 10,015 inhabitants, and Kirby Lonsdale 1686.
                    No other town in the county has a population of 1500.<note anchored="true"
