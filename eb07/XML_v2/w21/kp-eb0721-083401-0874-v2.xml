                    >Alexander</hi></label>, D. D. was the son of James Webster, minister of the
                    Tolbooth Church in Edinburgh, and was born in that city about the year 1707. He
                    was only thirteen years of age at the death of his father, and of course could
                    derive little from parental instruction or example. He studied, at the
                    university of Edinburgh, the several branches of learning with great
                    approbation, particularly those connected with the mathematics, for which he
                    discovered an early predilection. He afterwards attended the lectures of the
                    professor of divinity; and in the year 1733 he was ordained minister of the
                    parish of Culross, and in June 1737 he was admitted as one of the ministers of
                    the Tolbooth Church of Edinburgh. His eloquence was noble and manly, his piety
                    conspicuous, and the discharge of his pastoral duties faithful and laborious. To
                    these qualities he added an enlightened zeal for the external interests of the
                    church, a jealousy of corruption, a hatred of false politics and tyrannical
                    measures, which sometimes exposed him to calumny from the guilty, but secured
                    him the esteem of all who could value independence of soul and integrity of
                    heart.</p>
                <p part="N">The prosperity of fortune which placed Mr Webster in the church of his
                    father, and restored him to the polished society of his native city, was not
                    confined to these favours. Eleven days after his settlement in Edinburgh, he
                    obtained the hand of Mary Erskine, a young lady of considerable fortune, and
                    nearly related to the noble family of Dundonald. The genius of Mr Webster now
                    began to unfold itself. Family connections extended his acquaintance with the
                    nobility. Edinburgh then possessed a number of men, both in civil and
                    ecclesiastical stations, who have saved or adorned their country. With these he
                    was soon to cooperate in defending the Protestant interests from the arms and
                    artifices of rebellion.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1733, five or six ministers seceded from the church; and
                    being anxious to draw away as many as possible from the communion which they had
                    renounced, they invited down to Scotland, in 1741, George Whitefield, a young
                    preacher of great piety and extraordinary pulpit talents. On his way to
                    Dunfermline, he was met and entertained at Edinburgh by Mr Webster and some of
                    his brethren. From them he learned the state of church-parties in Scotland; and
                    though he kept his promise of preaching first in Fife, he declined connecting
                    himself with any particular sect. Disappointed of his influence and assistance,
                    the Seceders ascribed the effects of his preaching to sorcery and the devil,
                    while Webster, in a pamphlet which he published on the occasion, attributed them
                    to the influence of the Holy Spirit, an opinion regarded by the Seceders as
                    unspeakable wickedness.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1745, Webster remained in the city when it was taken by the
                    rebels, and employed his universal popularity and vigorous eloquence in
                    retaining the minds of the people in the interests of the house of Hanover. His
                    exertions in this were not overlooked by most of the spirited gentlemen who
                    acted in quelling the rebellion. He became an intimate friend of Duncan Forbes
                    of Culloden, Lord Milton, and others. He preserved to the latest period of his
                    career that activity both of mind and body which distinguished him in the prime
                    of life, obtaining at last his frequent wish and prayer, an easy and peaceful
                    death, after a very short indisposition, on the 25th of January 1784.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Webster’s character as a minister was popular in the extreme. To the
                    poor he was a father and a friend, a liberal patron to poor students. In his
                    person he was tall, and of a thin and meagre habit. His features were strongly
                    marked, and the conformity of the whole indicated genius and independence. To
                    him the widows of the clergy are indebted for the establishment of the
                    celebrated scheme, securing them in an annuity proportioned to certain rates of
                    payment; the plan of which he matured in his own mind soon after he was
                    appointed a minister of the Tolbooth Church. The success of the scheme has been
                    complete.</p>
