                    Delphi, with two tops; the one sacred to Apollo, the other sacred to Bacchus. It
                    is thus described by Chandler :—“Parnassus was the western boundary of Phocis,
                    and, stretching northward from about Delphi toward the OEtaean Mountains,
                    separated the western Locri from those who possessed the sea-coast before
                    Euboea. It was a place of refuge to the Delphians in times of danger. In the
                    deluge which happened under Deucalion, the natives were saved on it by following
                    the cry of wolves. On the invasion by Xerxes, some transported their families
                    over to Achaia, but many concealed them in the mountain, and in Corycium, a
                    grotto of the Nymphs. All Parnassus was renowned for sanctity, but Corycium was
                    the most noted among the hallowed caves and places. ‘ On the way to the summit
                    of Parnassus,’ says Pausanias, ‘ as much as sixty stadia beyond Delphi, is a
                    brazen image; and from thence the ascent to Corycium is easier for a man on
                    foot, and for mules and horses. Of all the caves in which I have been, this
                    appeared to me the best worth seeing. On the coasts, and by the sea side, are
                    more than can be numbered; but some are very famous both in Greece and in other
                    countries. The Corycian cave exceeds in magnitude those I have <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193492283?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2283-0092"/>mentioned,
                    and for the most part may be passed through without a light. It is sufficiently
                    high; and has water, some springing up, and yet more from the roof, which
                    petrifies, so that the bottom of the whole cave is covered with sparry icicles.
                    The inhabitants of Parnassus esteem it sacred to the Corycian nymphs, and
                    particularly to Pan. From the cave to reach the summits of the mountain is
                    difficult even to a man on foot. The summits are above the clouds, and the women
                    called <hi rend="italic">Thyades</hi> madden on them in the rites of Bacchus and
                    Apollo.’ Their frantic orgies were performed yearly. Wheler and his company
                    ascended Parnassus from Delphi, some on horses, by a track between the stadium
                    and the clefts of the mountain. Stairs were cut in the rock, with a strait
                    channel, perhaps a "water-duct. In a long hour, after many traverses, they
                    gained the top, and entering a plain, turned to the right, towards the summits
                    of Castalia, which are divided by deep precipices. From this eminence they had a
                    fine prospect of the Gulf of Corinth, and of the coast; Mount Cirphis appearing
                    beneath them as a plain, bounded on the east by the bay of Asprospitia, and on
                    the west by that of Salona. A few shepherds had huts there. They returned to the
                    way which they had quitted, and crossed a hill covered with pines and snow. On
                    their left was a lake, and beyond it a peak, exceedingly high, white with snow.
                    They travelled to the foot of it through a valley four or five miles in compass,
                    and rested by a plentiful fountain called <hi rend="italic">Drosonigo,</hi> the
                    stream boiling up a foot in diameter, and nearly as much above the surface of
                    the ground. It runs into the lake, which is about a quarter of a mile distant to
                    the south-east. They did not discover Corycium, or proceed farther on, but
                    keeping the lake on their right, came again to the brink of the mountain, and
                    descended by a deep and dangerous track to Racovi, a village four or five miles
                    eastward from Delphi. It was the opinion of Wheler, that no mountain in Greece
                    was higher than Parnassus; that it was not inferior to Mont Cenis amongst the
                    Alps; and that, if detached, it would be seen at a greater distance than even
                    Mount Athos. The summits are perpetually increasing, every new fall of snow
                    adding to the perennial heap, whilst the sun has power only to thaw the
                    superficies. Castalis, Pleistus, and innumerable springs are fed, some
                    invisibly, from the lakes and reservoirs, which, without these drains and
                    subterraneous vents, would swell, especially after heavy rains and the melting
                    nf snow, so as to fill the valleys, and run over the tops of the rocks down upon
                    Delphi, spreading wide an inundation, similar, as has been surmised, to the
                    Deucalio-nian deluge.”</p>
