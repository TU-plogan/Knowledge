                    a noble family amongst the Jews, flourished at Alexandria during the reign of
                    Caligula. He was the chief of an embassy sent to Rome about the year forty-two,
                    to plead the cause of the Jews against Apion, who had been sent by the
                    Alexandrians to charge them with neglecting the honours due to Caesar. Caligula,
                    however, would not allow him to speak, and behaved<pb break="no"

                    such a manner that Philo was in considerable danger of losing his life. Others,
                    again, tell us that he was heard, but. that lais demands were refused. He
                    afterwards went to Rome in the reign of Claudius, and both Eusebius and Jerome
                    inform us that he became acquainted with St Peter, with whom he lived on terms
                    of friendship. Photius adds, that he became a Christian, but afterwards, from
                    some motive of resentment, recanted. All this, however, is uncertain, because
                    the precise period at which St Peter visited Rome has not been ascertained.</p>
                <p part="N">Philo was educated at Alexandria, and made very great progress in
                    eloquence and in philosophy. After the fashion of the time, he cultivated, like
                    many of his nation and faith, the philosophy of Plato, whose principles he so.
                    thoroughly imbibed, and whose manner he so well imitated, that it became a
                    common saying, <hi rend="italic">Aut Plato philonizαt, aut Philo
                        plαtoηizat.</hi> Josephus describes him as a man “eminent on all accounts
                    and Eusebius represents him as “copious in speech, rich in sentiments, and
                    sublime in the knowledge of Holy Writ.” He was, however, so much immersed in
                    philosophy, particularly the Platonic, that he neglected the Hebrew language,
                    and also the rites and customs of his own people. Scaliger alleges, that Philo
                    knew no more of Hebrew and Syriac than a Gaul or a Scythian. Grotius is of
                    opinion that he is not fully to be depended on in what relates to the manners of
                    the Hebrews; and Cudworth declares that, though a Jew by nation, he was yet very
                    ignorant of Jewish customs. But Fabricius thinks differently; for although he
                    admits the inadvertencies and errors of Philo in regard to these matters, he
                    does not discover sufficient reason to justify charging so illustrious a doctor
                    of the law with ignorance. He allows, however, that Philo’s passion for
                    philosophy had made him more than half a Pagan. It led him to interpret the
                    whole of the law and the prophets upon Platonic ideas, and to admit nothing as
                    truly interpreted which was not agreeable to the principles of the Academy.
                    Besides, he turned every thing into allegory, and deduced the darkest meanings
                    from the plainest words. This pernicious practice Origen is known to have
                    imitated, and thus exposed himself to the scoffs of Celsus and of Porphyry.
                    Philo’s writings abound with high and mystical, as well as subtile, far-fetched,
                    and abstracted notions; and indeed the doctrines of Plato and Moses are so
                    promiscuously blended, that it is not easy to assign to each his peculiar
                    prerogatives. In his works, however, there are certainly many excellent things.
                    Though he is continually plato-nizing and allegorizing the Scriptures, he
                    abounds with fine sentiments and lessons of morality; and his morals are rather
                    the morals of a Christian than those of a Jew. History, as well as his own
                    writings, give us every reason to believe that he was a man of great prudence,
                    constancy, and virtue.</p>
                <p part="N">His works were first published in Greek by Turnebus, at Paris, 1552; and
                    to these a Latin translation, executed by Gelenius, was afterwards added. The
                    Paris edition of 1640, in folio, is the best that was published for a century; a
                    circumstance which led Cotelerius to observe, that Philo was an author who
                    deserved to have a better text and a better version. This, however, was
                    accomplished, in 1742, when a handsome edition of his works was published at
                    London, by Dr Mangey, In two vols, folio. In 1797, Jacob Bryant published the
                    Sentiments of Philo Judaeus concerning the <hi rend="italic">Logos</hi> or Word,
                    in order to prove that Philo borrowed his sentiments and expressions relative to
                    the second person of the adorable Trinity from the apostles. But it is to be
                    observed here, that Philo’s authority had repeatedly before been founded on by
                    various writers in favour of the fundamental principle of the existence of a
                    Divine Unity in a Trinity of Persons; particularly by Dr Allix in his Judgment
                    of the Jewish Church, 1699, and also by Mr Whitaker in his Origin of Arianism.

                    but his name has come down to us chiefly as the translator of a history which
                    Sanchoniathon had written in the Phoenician language. Eusebius has preserved
                    several fragments of the preface of Philo, and also of this history. This
                    fragment has called forth the ingenuity of many modern writers, but more
                    particularly of Mr Dodwell, who has written a very learned dissertation on the
                    subject. Fourmont also makes it the text of a work which he entitled <hi

                    other inventions, he mentions a machine of Ctesibius which discharged weapons by
                    means of compressed air, upon the same principle, no doubt, as our air-gun. ‘ In
