                    C. the author of a kind of romance, the earliest with which we are acquainted,
                    was born at Massilia, and is supposed to be the same of whom some account is
                    given by Tacitus <hi rend="italic">{Ann.</hi> xvi. 18). As proconsul, he
                    administered the province of Bithynia with considerable ability, and on his
                    return to Rome he became the favourite of Nero, and the director as well as
                    participator of all his pleasures. His influence with the emperor excited the
                    envy and jealousy of Tigellinus, and that minister soon found an opportunity of
                    putting an end to his connection with Nero. Petronius chose his own mode øi <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193495416?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5416-0333"
                    />closing his life, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 67, that he might escape a
                    severer punishment. There is no certainty, however; that this individual, of
                    whom Tacitus gives an account, is the same with the author of the work of which
                    fragments have come down to us; but even if he be not, still there is no doubt
                    that he must have flourished about this period, from the classical purity of his
                    language, and the general arrangement of his subject. The work is entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Satyricon</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and of it we have only
                    some fragments, which seem to have formed part of a selection from his work. It
                    contains the adventures of a certain freedman, Encolpius, sometimes of a
                    tragical, sometimes of a comical nature, which gives an opportunity to the
                    author of narrating fully the follies and vices of his age. There has been
                    preserved a beautiful episode, the Matron of Ephesus and the Supper of
                    Trimalchio, which admits us to the domestic circles of the noble Romans, and
                    makes us acquainted with their voluptuous mode of life. The characters are well
                    drawn; the whole idea of the scene is got up with much spirit as well as art;
                    and there are some beautiful descriptions, which make us regret that he should
                    have wasted his talents on common and obscene subjects. The obscenity of much
                    that is preserved is of the most gross and licentious nature; but the beauty of
                    his style, and the purity of his expressions, remind us of the classical period
                    of Roman literature. The best edition is that of Burmann (Traj. ad Rhen.
                    1709).</p>
