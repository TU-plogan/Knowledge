                    Greenwich. It is bounded on the north by Mid-Lothian or Edinburghshire, on the
                    east by the county of Selkirk, on the south by Dumfriesshire, and on the west by
                    Lanarkshire. Its greatest extent from north to south is about thirty miles, and
                    its greatest breadth from east to west about twenty-two; the contents being
                    229,778 English acres, of which only about a tenth part is fit for cultivation.
                    It is divided into sixteen parishes, twelve of whieh form the presbytery of
                    Peebles, and four belong to that of Biggar, but all are under the synod of

                    the sea. The general elevation of the pasture lands is about 1200 feet; yet,
                    with few exceptions, the hills are covered with green herbage, heath being
                    almost confined to a few of the highest ridges on the south-east. On the banks
                    of its streams are many pleasant and fertile spots; but, from the want of wood,
                    the general appearance is naked and uninteresting; though of late great
                    attention has been paid to planting, and it is estimated that there are now
                    nearly 7000 aeres under wood. The soil of the cultivated land, lying chiefly on
                    the sides of the lower hills and the banks of the streams, is for the most part
                    a light loam, with elay, moss, and moor on the high grounds. Coal, limestone,
                    and freestone abound in the parishes of Linton and Newlands, on the north side
                    of the county, and in the latter ironstone is also found. Limestone and
                    freestone are worked profitably in the parish of Linton; but the eoal formerly
                    obtained from Newlands has been abandoned, as not repaying the eost of outlay.
                    Lime, however, may still be purchased at Magbiehill, the eoal for burning which
                    is brought from Linton. At Stobo, slate of a good quality is quarried, and sold
                    with advantage to the proprietor. In the parish of Traquair there is also a
                    slate quarry in aetive operation. The river Tweed, from whieh this district is
                    often called Tweeddale, rises from a well of the same name, in the parish of
                    Tweedsmuir, in the south-western extremity of the eounty, about 1500 feet above
                    the level of the sea, and, flowing first north-east and then east, dividing the
                    eounty into two nearly equal parts, it passes into Selkirkshire at Gatehaup
                    Burn, after a winding course of about thirty-six miles. The Annan and the Clyde
                    have their souree in the same hill. Of the other streams, here ealled <hi
                        rend="italic">waters,</hi> the most considerable are Biggar, Lyne, Peebles
                    or Eddlestone, Leithan, Mannor, and Q,uair, which fall into the Tweed; and the
                    North and South Esks, whieh pursue their eourse into Mid-Lothian. The lakes or
                    loehs are St Mary’s, Waterloeh, and Slipperfield. These, as well as the
                    rivulets, abound in the eommon fresh-water fish, and most of the streams are
                    occasionally frequented by salmon; but salmon are not found in such numbers,
                    even in the Tweed, within the bounds of this eounty, as to afford a fishery that
                    will pay rent.</p>
                <p part="N">The elimate of Peeblesshire, owing to its elevation and want of shelter,
                    is perhaps more rigorous than that of any other of the southern eounties of
                    Scotland. Cold easterly winds prevail in spring, and greatly retard vegetation;
                    whilst in summer frosts often oeeur, whieh injure the potato and other erops;
                    and the winters are frequently so severe as to destroy turnips, the snow lying
                    so deep and so long as sometimes to occasion great loss amongst the floeks.</p>
                <p part="N">As this is almost exclusively a pastoral eountry, the farms are in
                    general large, most of them being from 1000 to 4000 acres. On the arable land
                    they are small, the greater number being below 100 acres. These are in general
                    held on leases for nineteen years, as in other parts of Seotland. Taking the
                    extent and rental as before stated, the average would be nearly five shillings
                    the English aere. This is ehiefly derived from live stock, especially sheep, of
                    whieh there may be about 120,000. These were formerly of the black-faced heath
                    variety, sometimes ealled Tweeddale sheep, from the name of the eounty, or
                    Linton sheep, from the name of a village on the northern side of the district,
                    where great fairs are held for the sale of them; but of late years the Cheviot
                    breed, whieh bears a mueh more valuable fleeee, has been established on many of
                    the lower hills, and the majority of those now fed in the eounty are of this
                    variety. The erops are the same as in other parts of Scotland, excepting that
                    wheat is cultivated only upon a very small seale. A variety of oats ealled the
                        <hi rend="italic">red oat,</hi> and sometimes the <hi rend="italic"

                    being first cultivated here on that estate, is very well adapted to high and
                    exposed situations, both because it ripens earlier than the common kind, and is
                    less liable to be beaten out by wind, whilst on good land it is found to be
                    highly productive.</p>
                <p part="N">Many of the proprietors have seats distinguished either for their
                    antiquity or their beauty; but the Earl of Traquair is the only nobleman who now
                    resides in the county. Peeblesshire, in 1811, was divided into about eighty
                    estates, many of them large, but not valuable in proportion. The valuation of
                    the whole is L.51,937.13s. 10d. Scotch; and the real rent, as assessed for the
                    property-tax that year, was, for the lands L.57,382 sterling, and for the houses
                    L.2568. Two thirds of the estates are valued under L.500 Scotch, a sum which may
                    indicate pretty nearly their present yearly value in sterling money; and little
                    less than two thirds of the whole are entailed.</p>
                <p part="N">In the county there are several remains of Roman camps. Drochil Castle
                    in the parish of Newlands, and Nedpath Castle in the parish of Peebles, are the
                    only two which are in tolerable preservation; but vestiges of ancient castles or
                    towers abound in the whole valley of the Tweed. The remains of the Castle of
                    Tinnes or Thanes are six feet in thickness, and the mortar is as hard as the
                    stone.</p>
                <p part="N">The inhabitants are generally educated, intelligent, and attentive to
                    religious duties, though few of the labouring classes or shepherds consider
                    poaching as in any degree criminal, and accordingly practise it to a
                    considerable extent, both by land and water. To this they are tempted by the
                    abundance of the game, which in some districts is most destructive to the poor.
                    The principal towns or villages in Peeblesshire are, Peebles, Linton,
                    Eddlestone, Skirling, Broughton, and Innerleithen. At this latter place, Lord
                    Traquair, the proprietor of the village, has erected a neat building with
                    corridor over a mineral well, which for some years past has attracted numerous
                    visitors to the village during the summer.</p>
                <p part="N">The royal burgh of Peebles formerly joined with Selkirk, Lanark, and
                    Linlithgow, in returning a member for the burghs; but since the passing of the
                    reform act, the burgh is merged in the county, and both united return a member
                    to serve in parliament; the qualification to vote for a candidate being the same
                    in the burgh as in the county, viz. ten pounds property, or fifty pounds rental
                    per annum. At the passing of the reform act there were, of old constituency
                    forty-seven, new constituency 300; but, in consequence of the creation of votes
                    for party purposes, there are now 760 electors on the poll-books.</p>

                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Peebles,</hi> the county-town, is not distinguished
                    for any particular trade or manufacture. The majority of the operatives are
                    hand-loom weavers, whose wages do not average more than from five to seven
                    shillings per week; the remainder of their living being procured by fishing,
                    harvestwork, &amp;c. It is not known when Peebles was erected into a royal
                    burgh; but in 1357 the burgh sent two members to parliament. The property of the
                    burgh, consisting of lands, mills, &amp;c. yields an annual revenue of L.1343.
                    Ils. 2d., which is expended in salaries to teachers, in paving and lighting the
                    streets, supplying the town with water, and other useful purposes. The whole
                    matters of police are regulated by a provost, two bailies, a treasurer, dean of
                    guild, and twelve councillors, chosen by the inhabitants. Considerably more
                    property was secured to the burgesses and inhabitants by charter of James VI.
                    dated the 10th of November 1621; but, as in most of the other burghs, this was
                    dissipated by the members of the corporation. Peebles is divided into the old
                    and the new town; and it is bounded on the south by the Tweed, and on the north
                    by the Eddlestone Water. It is worthy of remark, that the Tweed runs almost from
                    due west to east, whilst the Eddlestone Water, on the other side of the town,
                    flows exactly in the contrary direction. The population returns for the burgh
                    and parish were, in 1811, 2485; in 1821, 2701; andin 1831, 2750. The real value
                    is estimated at L.9255. Peebles is distant twenty-two miles south of
                    Edinburgh.</p>
