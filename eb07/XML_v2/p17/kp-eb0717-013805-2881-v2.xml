                        Reinhold</hi></label>, was descended of a noble family in Livonia, a
                    province which then belonged to the crown of Sweden. The Livonians having been
                    stripped of their privileges, and great part of their estates, by Charles XI.,
                    Patkul was deputed to prefer their complaint; a duty which he discharged with
                    such eloquence and courage, that the king, laying his hand upon his shoulder,
                    said, “You have spoken for your country as a brave man should, and I esteem you
                    for it.” Charles, however, was determined to punish the zeal and honesty which
                    he thought fit to commend; and a few days afterwards he caused Patkul to be
                    declared guilty of high treason, and condemned to death. Patkul, however, found
                    means to escape into Poland, where he continued until the death of Charles. He
                    hoped that his sentence would then have been reversed; but being disappointed in
                    this expectation, he applied to Augustus king of Poland, whom he solicited to
                    attempt the conquest of Livonia. Augustus, acting on this suggestion, possessed
                    himself of Livonia; and afterwards, when Charles XII. entered the province to
                    recover it, Patkul commanded in the Saxon army which opposed that remarkable
                    man. Charles proved victorious; and Patkul some time afterwards entered the
                    service of the Czar,.a little before Charles compelled Augustus to <pb

                    />abdicate the throne of Poland, and his subjects to elect Stanislaus in his
                    stead. The Czar then sent Patkul, with the title of his ambassador, into Saxony,
                    to induce Augustus to meet him at Grodno, that they might confer upon the state
                    of their affairs. He succeeded, and the proposed conference accordingly took
                    place; but immediately afterwards the Czar left Grodno for Astracan, to quell a
                    rebellion which had broken out there. As soon as the Czar was gone, Augustus
                    ordered Patkul, who was then at Dresden, to be seized as a state criminal. This
                    proceeding surprised all Europe; for Patkul was not only an ambassador, but an
                    ambassador from the only power that could afford him protection. Patkul, it
                    seems, had discovered that the ministers of Augustus were to propose a peace to
                    Charles upon any terms, and had therefore resolved to anticipate them, and
                    procure a separate peace between Charles and the Czar. But his design was
                    discovered; and, in order to prevent its success, Augustus ventured to seize his
                    person, assuring the Czar that he was a traitor, and had betrayed them both.</p>
                <p part="N">Augustus was soon afterwards reduced to beg peace from Charles at any
                    price, and the latter granted it upon certain conditions, one of which was, that
                    he should deliver up Patkul. This reduced Augustus to a sad dilemma. The Czar
                    had reclaimed Patkul as his ambassador; and, on the other hand, Charles
                    demanded, with threats, that the prisoner should be put into his hands.
                    Augustus, therefore, contrived an expedient by which he hoped to satisfy both.
                    He sent some guards to deliver Patkul, who was prisoner in the castle of
                    Königstein, to the Swedish troops; but by secret orders privately despatched, he
                    commanded the governor to let him escape. The governor, however, though he
                    received the order in time, disappointed its intention. He knew that Patkul was
                    rich; and having it now in his power to permit him to escape, he demanded a
                    large sum for the favour. Patkul refused to buy that liberty which he made no
                    doubt would be gratuitously restored; and, in the mean time, the Swedish guards
                    arrived with the order for his being delivered up to them. By this party he was
                    carried to the head-quarters of Charles at Albran-stadt, where he continued
                    three months, bound to a stake with a heavy chain of iron. He was then conducted
                    to Casimir, where, being ordered to be tried, he was, as a matter of course,
                    found guilty by his judges. After being kept in a state of horrible suspense for
                    several months, he was, on the 30th of September 1707, put to death, with
                    circumstances of atrocious cruelty, having been broken alive on the wheel, and
                    his agony prolonged with unheard-of barbarity.</p>
                <p part="N">Charles XII. has been severely censured for not pardoning Patkul, and we
                    are not inclined to vindicate that sovereign. Yet it must be remembered that
                    this unhappy man was guilty of a much greater crime than that which drew upon
                    him the displeasure of Charles XI. He had incited foreign powers to attack his
                    country when under the government of a boy; hoping, as he said himself, that it
                    would in such circumstances become an easy conquest. He was therefore a rebel of
                    the worst kind, and where is the absolute monarch tobe found who would readily
                    pardon such rebellion?</p>
