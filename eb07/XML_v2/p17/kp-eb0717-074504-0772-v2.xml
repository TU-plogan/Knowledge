                <p part="N"><label type="entry">PINDAR</label>, the most celebrated lyric poet that
                    Greece produced, was a native of Thebes in Boeotia, and born <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 518, forty years before the expedition of
                    Xerxes. He was the contemporary of AEschylus, but younger than Simonides, and
                    somewhat older than Bacchylides. It was scarcely to be expected that the early
                    years of such a distinguished poet should pass without some extraordinary event
                    taking place, and it is accordingly stated that he was exposed on a desert
                    mountain, and that he was fed by bees. Whether his father’s name was Diophantus
                    or Scopelinus is uncertain, but he.was of the humble profession of a player on
                    the flute, which he at first intended that his son should pursue. Finding,
                    however, that his talents entitled him to occupy.a higher position in the drama
                    of life, he placed him under Lasus of Hermione, a poet who then enjoyed a high
                    reputation. Although he lived in one of the most eventful periods of Grecian
                    history, it does not appear that he took any active part in the political
                    struggles of his country. It has been even doubted whether his feelings in
                    favour of the liberty of Greece were so ardent as to induce him to oppose the
                    progress of the Persians. Before the battle of Plataea a seditious movement had
                    taken place in Thebes, and a strong party had joined the Persians. In a passage
                    of the poet written at this period, Polybius imagines he can satisfactorily
                    discover that Pindar was the advocate of this step, and of course visits him
                    with not unmerited reproach. Stobaeus, however, gives this same passage more
                    fully, and it there appears that the poet recommends peace, not in reference to
                    the Persians, but to his fellow-citizens, who were tearing one another to pieces
                    in civil broils. But a still stronger proof that Polybius had taken a prejudiced
                    view of his character, is found in the circumstance that the poet wrote a
                    dithyrambic poem after the battle of Plataea, in which he spoke so warmly in
                    admiration of Athens, that the prevailing party amongst his countrymen took
                    umbrage at it, and visited him with punishment. The Athenians, on the other
                    hand, erected a statue to his honour. Again we find him comparing the victories
                    of Hiero at Cumae and Himera to the most illustrious engagements of the Greeks
                    against the Persians. It is impossible, therefore, to doubt that he joined
                    heartily in support of Greek independence, though he does not seem to have
                    thought that a monarchical government, justly and mildly administered, was
                    unworthy of respect. Of his private history nothing farther is known, except
                    that he died at an advanced age, probably about the year B. c. 439. According to
                    one tradition, he died whilst he was resting on the bosom of his young disciple
                    Theoxenus, after he had taken part in the active exercises of the gymnasium. He
                    was the writer of many poems, but they have all perished except some fragments,
                    and those hymns which he composed in honour of the conquerors at the solemn
                    games of Greece. They are divided into four books, of which the first contains
                    those who had conquered at the Olympic games, and consists of fourteen odes; the
                    second, addressed to the conquerors of the Pythian games, contains twelve odes;
                    the third, addressed to the Nemean conquerors, contains eleven odes; and the
                    fourth, celebrating the Isthmian conquerors, contains eight odes. It is
                    difficult to believe that the reputation of Pindar was founded upon the poetry
                    which has come down to us, and indeed his dithyrambic hymns are spoken of as his
                    finest productions. He is no doubt distinguished by a warm and enthusiastic
                    genius, and by bold and figurative expressions; but the abruptness of his
                    transitions, and the numerous allusions to persons and things now altogether
                    unknown, and which, if known, would not interest the reader, very much diminish
                    the pleasure with which his poetry is read. Still the opinion of Horace must for
                    ever place him in the foremost rank of lyric poets.</p>
