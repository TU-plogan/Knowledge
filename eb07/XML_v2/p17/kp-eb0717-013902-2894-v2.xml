                <p part="N"><label type="entry">PATNA</label>, a large and celebrated city of
                    Hindustan, in the province of Bahar, of which it is the capital. It is a city of
                    great antiquity, and is supposed to have been the Palibothra of the ancients. It
                    is situated on the southern shore of the Ganges, which is here five miles wide
                    during the rainy season, and deep enough to float a ship of war. The city is
                    built along the river, and is one continued street for many miles along the
                    Ganges, whilst it is only one mile in breadth. The houses of the natives are
                    generally built of mud; but those of the Europeans, which extend from
                    Banki-poor, are of brick, and make a very handsome appearance, which is not the
                    case with the rest of the city. It contains several mosques and temples; but
                    they are old, and without ornament. It was formerly fortified after the fashion
                    of Hindustan, and still possesses a small citadel, which is now used as a
                    barrack and store-house; but neither this nor the fortifications of the town
                    could have resisted a regular attack of modern artillery for twenty-four hours,
                    although it has often made an obstinate defence against the attack of Indian
                    troops. The town is large and populous; and chintzes and dimities of various
                    kinds are manufactured here, as well as cloths resembling diaper and damask
                    linen. Flannels are also woven in the vicinity, as well as a sort of canvass
                    from cotton. The neighbouring country produces the finest opium and saltpetre,
                    and great quantities of wheat and other valuable grains; also sugar and indigo.
                    Opium and saltpetre are strictly monopolized; but a considerable trade is
                    carried on in all other articles. A large quantity of saltpetre is annually
                    despatched for internal consumption, and for exportation. It was here that the
                    English first established a factory, the remains of which are still to be seen,
                    where two hundred English prisoners were massacred in 1763, under the orders of
                    the German adventurer Somro, or Summers, then in the service of Meer Cossim;
                    immediately after which the city was captured by the British, and has ever since
                    remained in their possession. A monument is erected to <hi rend="subscript">

                    erected here a depot to contain rice. It is a building of stone, in shape like a
                    bee-hive, with two winding staircases on the outside, which have been ascended
                    on horseback. Banki-poor, one of the suburbs of Patna, is the residence of the
                    servants of the Company. They compose a numerous establishment, with liberal
                    appointments. The travelling distance from Patna to Calcutta by Moorshedabad is
                    400 miles, from Benares by Buxar 155, from Delhi 661, from Agra 544, from
                    Lucknow 316 miles. Long. 85.15. E. Lat. 25. 37. N.</p>
