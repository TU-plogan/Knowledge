                <p part="N"><label type="entry">PERFUME</label> denotes either the volatile effluvia
                    from any body affecting the organ of smell, or the substance emitting those
                    effluvia; in which last sense the word is most commonly used. The use of
                    perfumes was frequent amongst the Hebrews, and the orientals in general, before
                    it was known to the Greeks and the Romans. In the time of Moses perfumes must
                    have been known in Egypt, since he speaks of the art of the perfumer, and gives
                    the composition of two kinds of perfumes, one of which was to be offered to the
                    Lord upon the golden altar in the holy place, and the other was appointed for
                    the anointing of the high priest and his sons, as also of the tabernacle, and
                    all the vessels that were used in divine service. The Hebrews had likewise
                    perfumes which they employed in the process of embalming their dead. The
                    composition is not known, but it is certain that they generally made use of
                    myrrh, aloes, and other strong astringent drugs, that served to prevent
                    putrefaction (John, xix. 49). Besides the per fumes for these purposes, the
                    Scripture mentions others which the Hebrews used on various occasions. The
                    spouse in the Canticles commends the scent of the perfumes of her lover; and her
                    lover in return says, that the scent of the perfumes of his spouse surpasses the
                    most excellent odours. He names particularly the spikenard, the calamus, the
                    cinnamon, the myrrh, and the aloes, as forming part of those perfumes. The
                    voluptuous woman described by Solomon says that she had perfumed her bed with
                    myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. The epicures mentioned in the book of Wisdom
                    encourage one another to the luxuriant use of odours and costly perfumes. Isaiah
                    reproaches Judaea, which he describes as a spouse faithless to God, with being
                    painted and perfumed to please strangers: “Thou wentest to the king with
                    ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes.” Ezekiel seems to accuse the Jews of
                    having profaned the odours and perfumes, the use of which was reserved to sacred
                    things, by applying them to their own use. Perfumes came afterwards to be very
                    common amongst the Greeks and the Romans, especially those composed of musk,
                    ambergris, and civet. The <hi rend="italic">nardus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >malobathrum,</hi> which were held in much estimation, were imported from
                    Syria. The <hi rend="italic">unguentum nardinum</hi> was variously prepared, and
                    contained many ingredients. <hi rend="italic">Malobathrum</hi> was an Indian
                    plant. Perfumes were also used at sacrifices to regale the gods, .at feasts to
                    increase the pleasures of sensation, at funerals to overpower cadaverous smells
                    and please the manes of the'dead, and in the theatres to prevent the offensive
                    effluvia or odour of a crowd from being perceived.</p>
