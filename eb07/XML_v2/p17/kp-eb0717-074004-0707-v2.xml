                    continental states of the Sardinian monarchy, forming the north-western portion
                    of Italy. It was separated from Sardinia by the French in the year 1798, and in
                    1802 incorporated with France. On the fall of Napoleon in 1814 it was restored
                    to the king of Sardinia, and the duchies of Milan and Montferrat have been
                    annexed to it. It is now divided into twenty-six districts. Piedmont, in a
                    narrower sense, borders on the Valais and Savoy to the north, on France to the
                    west, on Nice and Genoa to the south, and on the Sardinian Milanese and
                    Montferrat to the east. These limits comprise an area of 6575 square miles, and
                    contain a population of 1,400,000 souls. If we include the Sardinian Milanese
                    and Montferrat, its superficial extent is above 12,000 square miles, <pb

                    of Lombardy, somewhat narrowed, and-more closely bounded by the mightiest ranges
                    of the Alps and Apennines; the former on the north and west, the latter on the
                    south. The principal river is the Po, which runs through its centre, dividing it
                    into two nearly equal parts; and it receives here, nearly all its early
                    tributaries, which, from being in the vicinity of their mountain sources, are
                    liable to sudden and destructive inundations. The climate, of course, varies
                    according .to the elevation of the surface. In the mountainous regions in the
                    north and west the snow and ice remain during a great portion of the year. In
                    the plains the climate is temperate during winter, and the excessive heats of
                    summer are tempered by the vicinity of the Alps. The soil generally· is very
                    fertile, the plains traversed by the Po being particularly prolific, and in a
                    high state of cultivation. They yield in abundance corn, wine, oil, fruits,
                    rice, and hemp. But the staple product is silk, the breeding of&lt;the silk-worm
                    being nowhere in Italy carried to the same extent; and the produce is also
                    reckoned the finest in quality. It produces yearly 22,000,000 <hi rend="italic"
                        >lire</hi> worth of silk, most of which is exported in the raw state.
                    Another important branch of industry is the breeding of cattle, the pastures
                    being both extensive and rich. The hills are in general covered with vineyards,
                    the produce of which is very abundant, but generally of inferior quality.
                    Olives, almonds, chestnuts, and in smaller quantities figs, oranges, and lemons,
                    are raised here. The northern, western, and southern districts supply the
                    central region with wood. The Piedmontese are industrious and frugal, and are
                    all Catholics, with the exception of about 20,000 Waldenses and a few Jews. They
                    have Some silk, linen, and woollen manufactures, and thousands of them are seen
                    travelling about Italy, France, and Germany as pedlars. The capital of Piedmont
                    is Turin. This province derives its name from its situation at the foot of the
                    mountains.</p>
