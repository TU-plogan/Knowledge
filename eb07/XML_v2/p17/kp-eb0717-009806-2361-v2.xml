                        rend="italic">persona ecclesioe,</hi> is one who has full ∙ possession of
                    all the rights of a parochial church. He is called parson, <hi rend="italic"
                        >persona,</hi> because by his person, the church, which is an invisible
                    body, is represented; and he is in himself a body corporate, in order to protect
                    and defend the rights of the church, which he personates, by a perpetual
                    succession. He is sometimes called the <hi rend="italic">rector</hi> or governor
                    of the church; but the appellation of <hi rend="italic">parson,</hi> however it
                    may be depreciated by familiar and indiscriminate use, is the most legal and
                    most honourable title that a parish priest can enjoy; because such a one, as Sir
                    Edward Coke observes, and he alone, is said <hi rend="italic">vicem seu</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">personam ecclxsiae</hi><hi rend="italic">gerere.</hi> A parson
                    has, during his life, the freehold in himself of the parsonage-house, the glebe,
                    the tithes, and other dues. But these are sometimes appropriated; that is to
                    say, the benefice is perpetually annexed to some spiritual corporation, either
                    sole or aggregate.</p>
                <p part="N">The appropriating corporations, or religious houses, were wont to depute
                    one of their own body to perform divine service, and administer the sacraments,
                    in those parishes of which the society was thus the parson. This officiating
                    minister was in reality no more than a curate, deputy, or vicegerent of the
                    appropriator, and was therefore called <hi rend="italic">vicarius,</hi> or
                    vicar. His stipend was at the discretion of the appropriator, who was, however,
                    bound of common right to find somebody, <hi rend="italic">qui illi</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">temporalibus, episcopo</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">spiritualibus, debeat
                        respondere.</hi> But this was done in so scandalous a manner, and the
                    parishes suffered so much <pb break="no" facs="nls:193492374?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0717-2374-0099"/>by the neglect of the appropriators, that the
                    legislature was forced to interpose; and accordingly it was enacted, by statute
                    15 Richard II. c. 6, that in all appropriations of churches the diocesan bishop
                    should ordain, in proportion to the value of the church, a competent sum to be
                    distributed amongst the poor parishioners annually, and to provide that the
                    vicarage should be sufficiently endowed. It seems that the parish were frequent
                    sufferers, not only by the want of divine service, but also by the withholding
                    of those alms for which, amongst other purposes, the payment of tithes was
                    originally imposed; and therefore in this act a pension was directed to be
                    distributed amongst the poor parochians, as well as a sufficient stipend to the
                    vicar. But he, being liable to be removed at the pleasure of the appropriator,
                    was not likely to insist too rigidly upon the legal sufficiency of the stipend;
                    and, therefore, by statute 4 Henry IV. c. 12, it was ordained that the vicar
                    should be a secular person, not a member of any religious house; that he should
                    be vicar perpetual, not removeable at the caprice of the monastery; and that he
                    should be canonically instituted and inducted, and be sufficiently endowed, at
                    the discretion of the ordinary, to do divine service, to inform the people, and
                    to show hospitality. In consequence of these statutes, the endowments have
                    usually been by a portion of the glebe, or land belonging to the parsonage, and
                    a particular share of the tithes, which the appropriators found it most
                    troublesome to collect, and which are therefore generally called <hi
                        rend="italic">petty or small tithes</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the
                    greater, or predial tithes, being still reserved for their own use. But the same
                    rule was not observed in the endowment of all vicarages. Hence some are more
                    liberally, and others more scantily, endowed; and hence the tithes of many
                    things, as wood in particular, are in some parishes rectorial, and in others
                    vicarial, tithes.</p>
                <p part="N">The distinction therefore between a parson and vicar is this. The parson
                    has for the most part the whole right to all the ecclesiastical dues in his
                    parish; but a vicar has generally an appropriator over him, who is entitled to
                    the best part of the profits, and to whom he is in effect perpetual curate, with
                    a standing salary. The method of becoming a parson or vicar is much the same. To
                    both there are four necessary requisites; holy orders, presentation,
                    institution, and induction.</p>
