                <p part="N"><label type="entry">PHARISEES</label>, a famous, sect amongst the Jews,
                    who distinguished themselves by their zeal for the traditions of the elders,
                    which they derived from the same fountain with the written word itself;
                    pretending that both were delivered to Moses from Mount Sinai, and were
                    therefore of equal authority. From their rigorous observance of these
                    traditions, they looked upon themselves as more holy than other men; and
                    therefore separated themselves from those whom they thought sinners or profane,
                    so as not to eat or to drink with them. Hence, from the Hebrew word <hi
                        rend="italic">phαric</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript">
                        i</hi> which signifies to separate, they received the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">Pharisees</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Separatists.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">This sect was one <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the most ancient and
                    considerable amongst the Jews; but its origin is not very well known. However,
                    it was in great repute in the time of our Saviour, and must have had its origin
                    at the same time with the traditions; in fact, they grew together, until at
                    length they had so far gained ground that the traditional law swallowed up the
                    written, and those who were the propagators of it included the bulk of the
                    Jewish nation.</p>
                <p part="N">The extraordinary pretences of the Pharisees to righteousness drew after
                    them the common people, who held them in the highest esteem and veneration. Our
                    Saviour, however, frequently charges them with hypocrisy, and with making the
                    law of God of no effect through their traditions.<note anchored="true"

                            13-23; and Luke, xi. 39-52.</p></note> Several of these traditions are
                    particularly mentioned in the gospel; but they had a vast number more, which may
                    be seen in the Talmud, the grand object of which is to explain and enforce those
                    which this sect required to be believed and observed.</p>
                <p part="N">The Pharisees, contrary to the opinion of the Sadducees, held a
                    resurrection of the dead, and the existence of angels and spirits. But,
                    according to Josephus, this resurrection of theirs was no more than a
                    Pythagorean resurrection, that is, of the soul only, by its transmigration into
                    another body, and being born anew with it; and from this they excluded all who
                    were notoriously wicked, being of opinion that the souls of such persons were
                    consigned to a state of everlasting wo. As to lesser crimes, they held that
                    these were punished in the bodies which the souls of those who committed them
                    were next sent into.</p>
                <p part="N">Josephus, however, either mistook the faith of his countrymen, or, which
                    is equally probable, wilfully misrepresented it, in order to render their
                    opinions more respected by the Roman philosophers, whom he appears on every
                    occasion to have been desirous to please. The Pharisees had many pagan notions
                    respecting the soul; but Bishop Bull, in his <hi rend="italic">Harmonia</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Apostolica,</hi> has clearly proved that they held a
                    resurrection of the body, and supposed a certain bone to remain uncorrupted in
                    order to furnish the matter out of which the resurrection of the body was to be
                    effected. They did not, however, believe that all mankind were to be raised from
                    the dead. A resurrection was the privilege of the children of Abraham alone, who
                    were all to rise on Mount Zion; their incorruptible bones, wherever they might
                    be buried, being carried to that mountain below the surface of the earth. The
                    state of future felicity, in which the Pharisees believed, was in fact
                    exceedingly gross. They * imagined, that men in the next world, as well as in
                    the present, were to eat and drink, and enjoy the pleasures of Jove, each being
                    reunited to his former wife. Hence the Sadducee, who believed in no
                    resurrection, and supposed that our Saviour taught it as a Pharisee, shrewdly
                    urged <pb break="no" facs="nls:193495520?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0717-5520-0341"/>the difficulty of disposing of the woman who
                    had in this world been the wife of seven husbands. Had the resurrection of
                    Christianity been of the Pharisaical kind, this difficulty would have been
                    insurmountable; and accordingly we find the people, and even some of the
                    Pharisees themselves, struck with the manner in which our Saviour removed
                    it.</p>
                <p part="N">This sect appears to have had some confused notions, derived probably
                    from the Chaldaeans and Persians, respecting the pre-existence of souls; and
                    hence it was that Christ’s disciples asked him, concerning the blind man, “Who
                    did sin, this man or his parents, that he was born blind ?” And when the
                    disciples told Christ, that some said he was Elias, Jeremias, or one of the
                    prophets, the meaning of this can only be, that they thought he had come into
                    the world with the soul of Elias, Jeremias, or some other of the old prophets,
                    transmigrated into him. Like the Essenes, the Pharisees held absolute
                    predestination, and like the Sadducees, free-will; but how they reconciled these
                    incompatible doctrines is nowhere sufficiently explained. The sect of the
                    Pharisees was not extinguished by the ruin of the Jewish commonwealth. The
                    greater part of the modern Jews are still of this sect, and as much devoted to
                    traditions or the oral law as their ancestors ever were.</p>
