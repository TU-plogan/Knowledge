                <p part="N"><label type="entry">PHOENIX</label>, the great palm or date-tree. There
                    is only one species, viz. the <hi rend="italic">dactylifeτa,</hi> or common
                    date-tree, a na tive of Africa and the eastern countries, where it grows to
                    fifty, sixty, and a hundred feet in height. The trunk is round, upright, and
                    studded with protuberances, which are the vestiges of the decayed leaves. From
                    the top issues forth a cluster of leaves or branches eight or nine feet long,
                    extending all around like an umbrella, and bending a little towards the earth.
                    The lower part produces a number of stalks like those of the middle, but these
                    seldom shoot so high as four or five feet. The stalks, according to Adanson,
                    diffuse the tree very considerably, so that, wherever it grows naturally in
                    forests, it is extremely difficult to open a passage through its prickly leaves.
                    The date-tree was introduced into Jamaica soon after the conquest of that island
                    by the Spaniards. There are, however, but few of them in the island at the
                    present time. The fruit is somewhat in the shape of an acorn. It is composed of
                    a thin, light, and glossy membrane, somewhat pellucid and yellowish, which
                    contains a fine, soft, and pulpy fruit, that is firm, sweet, and somewhat vinous
                    to the taste, esculent, and wholesome; and within this is enclosed a solid,
                    tough, and hard kernel, of a pale gray colour upon the outside, and finely
                    marbled within like the nutmeg. For medicinal use dates areto be chosen large,
                    full, fresh, yellow on the surface, soft and tender, not too much wrinkled; such
                    as have a vinous taste, and do not rattle when shaken. They are produced in many
                    parts of Europe, but never ripen perfectly there. The best are brought from
                    Tunis; they are also very fine and good in Egypt, and in many parts of the East.
                    Those of Spain and France look well; but they are never perfectly ripe, and very
                    subject to decay. They are preserved three different ways; some pressed and dry;
                    others pressed more moderately, and again moistened with their own juice; and
                    others not pressed at all, but moistened with the juice of other dates, as they
                    are packed up, which is done in baskets or skins. Those preserved in this last
                    way are much the best. Dates have always been esteemed moderately strengthening
                    and astringent.</p>
                <p part="N">Dates afford wholesome nourishment, and have a very agreeable taste when
                    they are fresh; the Arabs, however, eat them without seasoning. They dry and
                    harden them in the sun to reduce them to a kind of meal, which they lay up in
                    store to supply themselves with food during the long journeys which they often
                    undertake across their deserts. This simple food is sufficient to nourish them
                    for a long time. The inhabitants of the Sahara also procure from their dates a
                    kind of honey, which is exceedingly sweet. For this purpose they choose those
                    which have the softest pulp; and having put them into a large jar with a hole in
                    the bottom, they squeeze them by placing over them a weight of eight or ten
                    pounds. The most fluid part of the substance, which drops through the hole, is
                    what they call the honey of the date. Even the stones, though very hard, are not
                    thrown away, but given to their camels and sheep as food, after they have been
                    bruised or laid to soften in water.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Phoenix,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Antiquity,</hi>
                    a famous bird, which is generally regarded by the moderns as fabulous. The
                    ancients speak of this bird as single, or the only one of its kind. They
                    describe it as of the size of an eagle, having its head finely crested with a
                    beautiful plumage, its neck covered with feathers of a gold colour, and the rest
                    of its body, except the tail, purple, and the eyes sparkling like stars. They
                    hold that it lives five or six hundred years in the wilderness; that when thus
                    advanced in age, it builds itself a pile of sweet wood and aromatic gums, which
                    it fires with the wafting of its wings, and thus bums itself; and that from its
                    ashes arises a worm, which in time grows up to be a phoenix. Hence the
                    Phoenicians gave the name <hi rend="italic">phoenix</hi> to the palm-tree,
                    because, when burned down to the root, it rises again fairer than ever.</p>
