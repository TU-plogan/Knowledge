                <p part="N"><label type="entry">PERJURY</label> is defined by Sir Edward Coke to be
                    a crime committed when a lawful oath is administered, in some judicial
                    proceeding, to a person who swears wilfully, absolutely, and falsely, in a
                    matter which is material to the issue or point in question. In ancient times it
                    was in some places punished with death; at other periods it made the false
                    swearer liable to the punishment due to the crime which he had charged the
                    innocent person withal; and at others, again, it subjected him to a pecuniary
                    fine. But though it escaped human, yet it was thought, amongst the ancients in
                    general, that the divine vengeance would most certainly overtake it; and there
                    are upon record many severe inflictions from the hand of God, as monuments of
                    the abhorrence in which this atrocious crime is held by the Deity. The souls of
                    the deceased were supposed to be employed in punishing perjured persons. Even
                    the inanimate creation was thought to take vengeance on this crime. The Greeks
                    supposed that no person could swear falsely by Styx without some remarkable
                    punishment; and that any one guilty of perjury could not enter the cave of
                    Palaemon at Corinth without being made a memorable example of divine justice. In
                    Sicily, at the temple of the Palici, there were fountains called <hi
                        rend="italic">Delli,</hi> from which issued boiling water, with flames and
                    balls of fire; and we are told that if any person swore falsely near them, he
                    was instantly struck dumb, blind, lame, or dead, or was swallowed up by the
                    waters. But although perjury was thus held in general abhorrence, yet in spite
                    of the credit given to such accounts of divine inflictions, it was so much
                    practised by the Greeks, that <hi rend="italic">Graeca</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >fides</hi> became a proverb. Lovers’ perjuries, however, were supposed to
                    pass unnoticed, or to be but very slightly punished with blackness of the nails,
                    a decayed tooth, or some similar diminution of beauty. The ancient philosophers
                    were so afraid of perjury, that even an oath before a judge was never admitted
                    excepting for want of other proof. Plato’s precept was, not to administer an
                    oath wantonly, but upon deep grounds, and with the strictest caution. Ulpian
                    gives his opinion thus: “Some are forward to take oaths from a contempt of
                    religion; others, from an extraordinary awe of the Divine Majesty, carry their
                    fear to an unreasonable superstition, so as to make an equitable decision of a
                    judge necessary.” “No man will perjure himself,” says Aristotle, “who apprehends
                    vengeance from Heaven and disgrace amongst men.” Clinias was so very scrupulous,
                    that rather than take even a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193494142?mode=fullsize"

                    talents. Perjury, in the time of Philo Judaeus, was abominated and capitally
                    punished amongst the Jews; but since that time they have much degenerated, being
                    poisoned by the Talmud, which <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi> states, that he who
                    breaks his promissory oath, or any vows he enters into during the year, if he
                    have a mind that they should be ineffectual and invalid, may rise the last day
                    of the year, and say, Whatever promises, oaths, and vows, I may think fit to
                    make in the year following, let them be null, void, and of no effect.<note
