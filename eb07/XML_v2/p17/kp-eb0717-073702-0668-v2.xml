                <p part="N"><label type="entry">PICARDS</label>, a religious sect which arose in
                    Bohemia in the fifteenth century. Picard, the author of this sect, and from whom
                    it has derived its name, drew after him, as has been generally said, a number of
                    men and women, pretending that he would restore them to the primitive state of
                    innocence in which man was created; and accordingly he assumed the title of the
                        <hi rend="italic">New Adam.</hi> With this pretence he taught his followers
                    to give themselves up to all impurity, saying that therein consisted the liberty
                    of the sons of God; and that all those not of their sect were in a state of
                    bondage. He first published his notions in Germany and the Low Countries, and,
                    persuading many people to go naked, he gave them the name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Adamites.</hi> After this he seized upon an island in the river Lausnecz,
                    some leagues from Thabor, the head-quarters of Zisca, where he fixed himself and
                    his followers. His women were common, but none were allowed to enjoy them
                    without his permission; so that when any man desired a particular woman, he
                    carried her to Picard, who gave him leave in these words, “Go, increase,
                    multiply, and fill the earth.” At length, however, Zisca, general of the
                    Hussites, scandalized at their abominations, marched against them, made himself
                    master of their island, and put them all to death except two, whom he spared
                    that he might learn their doctrine. Such is the account which various writers,
                    relying on the authorities of AEneas Sylyius and Varillas, have given of the
                    Picards, who appear to have been a party of the Vaudois, who fled from
                    persecution in their own country, and sought refuge in Bohemia. It is indeed
                    doubtful whether a sect of this denomination» chargeable with such wild
                    principles and such licentious conduct, ever existed; and it is certainly
                    astonishing that Mr Bayle should adopt the reproachful representations of the
                    writers just mentioned; for it appears probable, at least, that the whole is a
                    calumny invented and propagated in order to disgrace the Picards, merely because
                    they deserted the communion and protested against the errors of the church of
                    Rome. Lasitius informs us, that Picard, together with forty other persons,
                    besides women and children, settled in Bohemia in the year 1418. Balbinus the
                    Jesuit, in his <hi rend="italic">Epitome Rerum Bohemicarum</hi> (lib. ii.),
                    gives a similar account, and charges against the Picards none of the
                    extravagances or crimes ascribed to them by Sylvius. Schlecta, secretary of
                    Ladislaus, king of Bohemia, in his letters to Erasmus, in which he gives a
                    particular account of the Picards, says that they considered the pope,
                    cardinals, and bishops of Rome, as the true Antichrists, and the adorers of the
                    consecrated elements in the eucharist as downright idolaters; that they denied
                    the corporeal presence of Christ in this sacrament; that they condemned the
                    worship of saints, prayers for the dead, auricular confession, the penance
                    imposed by priests, the feasts and vigils observed in the Catholic church; and
                    that they confined themselves to the observance of the Sabbath, and of the two
                    great feasts of Christmas and Pentecost. From this account it would appear that
                    they were no other than the Vaudois; and Μ. deBeausobre has clearly shown that
                    they were both of the same sect, though under different denominations. Besides,
                    it is certain that the Vaudois were settled in Bohemia in the year 1178, where
                    some of them adopted the rites of the Greek, and <pb break="no"

                    those of the Latin church. The former were pretty generally adhered to till the
                    middle of the fourteenth century, when the establishment of the Latin rites
                    caused great disturbance. Upon the commencement of the national troubles in
                    Bohemia, on account of the opposition to the papal power, the Picards more
                    publicly avowed and defended their religious opinions; and they formed a
                    considerable body in an island by the river Launitz or Lausnecz, in the district
                    of Bechin, and, recurring to arms, were defeated by Zisca.</p>
