                    character of his two pupils Theopompus and Ephorus, the philosopher is reported
                    to have said, “se calcaribus in Ephoro, contra autem in Theopompo frenis ' uti
                    solere.”</p>
                <p part="N">The great work of Ephorus was a history of the wars between the Greeks
                    and Persians, in which, like Herodotus, he introduced, in the form of episodes,
                    the description of foreign and barbarous nations, yet only in as tar as they
                    were connected with and served to illustrate Grecian history. It must be
                    allowed, however, that the Greeks considered the work of Ephorus as an universal
                    history; but then this may be explained from the extreme vanity of that nation,
                    in believing that their history was the central point on which that of the whole
                    world turned. Meier Marx, who has published a collection of the fragments of
                    this work, has endeavoured to give us the contents ot the thirty books of which
                    it was composed.</p>
                <p part="N">The first book contained an account of the return of the Heraclidae into
                    the Peloponnesus, and the change of affairs consequent upon that event; and the
                    second was occupied with the state of the rest of Greece; and the third narrated
                    the departure of the Greek colonies to Asia. In these three books he thus
                    brought the history of Greece and .Asia down to that period when they began to
                    assume a peaceful aspect, probably a few years before the commencement of the
                    Median war. After this introduction he proceeded to describe separately each
                    country which subsequently became the scene of important transactions; in the
                    fourth book Europe, in the fifth Asia and Africa, and in the sixth he probably
                    gave an account of the nation of the Pelasgi. The seventh book contained the
                    most ancient traditionary notices of Sicily, and probably all he could collect
                    respecting the original inhabitants of Italy and the adjacent islands. The
                    eighth book narrated the various changes of fortune to which those nations had
                    been subject, who in succession held the supreme command in Asia, namely, the
                    Assyrians, Lydians, and Persians. The fragments which remain refer principally
                    to the affairs of Croesus. In the ninth book we had the origin, changes, and
                    migrations of the Amazons, Scythians, and other nations who inhabited the coasts
                    of the Pontus and those northern countries, whence, through Thrace and Thessaly,
                    he returned to Greece and its affairs. Then it was that Ephorus reached the
                    period when, like every Greek historian, he imagined that the transactions of
                    the whole world became centred in the causes and events of the Persian war; and
                    then also he began to treat his subject with more copiousness, for we find that
                    in his tenth book he bad already brought down his history to the times of
                    Miltiades, about 490 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> In his eighteenth book he
                    had reached Dercyllidas, 399 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> In his twentyfilth
                    be had arrived at the battle of Mantinea, 362 B. c. We thus see that he must
                    have employed seven or eight books in describing thirty-seven years, whilst bis
                    last four or five books could contain the history of only twenty-two years. The
                    part of the thirtieth, book which gave an account of the sacred war was
                    composed, not by Ephorus himself, but by his son Demophilus; at the conclusion
                    of the war Ephorus took up the thread of the history, and continued it to the
                    siege of Perinthus, 340 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> According to Diodorus
                    Siculus, the whole period treated of was 750 years.</p>
