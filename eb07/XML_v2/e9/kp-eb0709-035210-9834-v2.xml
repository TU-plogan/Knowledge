                <p part="N"><label type="entry">EQUITES</label>, an order of men in the commonwealth
                    of Rome, to which we can furnish no exact parallel in modern times. They seem,
                    indeed, to have resembled in some degree the gentry of England; with this
                    difference however, that they enjoyed peculiar privileges, and were more of a
                    separate caste than any body of men which can now be pointed out. Their origin
                    goes back to the earliest times of Roman history, though we can perceive, even
                    from the legendary statements of Livy and Dionysius, that their constitution and
                    mode of selection had been changed in the course of ages. During the reign of
                    the kings they evidently appear to have been of noble birth, the younger
                    branches of patrician families. This we may infer from the statement of Polybius
                    (vi. 20), when he says that the knights <hi rend="italic">now</hi> are chosen
                    according to fortune, evidently intimating that their selection had depended on
                    a different principle at a previous period. Romulus is said to have divided them
                    into three centuries; and the very names of Ramnenses, Titienses, and Luceres,
                    by which he designated them, point out distinctly their high origin. Both Tullus
                    Hostilius and Tarquinius added to their number; but it was Servius Tullius (576
                    B. c.) who first organised them into a distinct body, and compelled the state to
                    contribute annually to their maintenance. It is difficult to perceive in what
                    way we are to explain the statement of Livy (i. 43), that the sum of ten
                    thousand pounds of brass was given to each for the purchase of a horse; an
                    enormous sum, when compared with that at which oxen and sheep were rated in the
                    table of penalties. They were bound of course to be provided with a noble steed,
                    and may have been obliged to replace it if it fell from any casualty in war. The
                    accoutrements, too, and a slave to take charge of it, were possibly all included
                    in this large sum. But whether, when the censor ordered the knight to sell his
                    horse, it was the intention that the outfit money should be refunded to the
                    state, we have now no means of determining. Livy tells us also that a tax was
                    imposed on each <hi rend="italic">vidua,</hi> of two thousand pounds of brass,
                    to maintain a knight’s horse. This certainly sounds very strange; for it seems
                    inconceivable that there should have been such a large number of rich widows;
                    and even though we understand by the word <hi rend="italic">vidua</hi> every
                    single woman, maiden as well as widow, we do not think that we thereby get out
                    of the difficulty.</p>
                <p part="N">As early as 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> we find that a certain
                    fortune was required to enable a man to be raised to the rank of eques. In that
                    year, at the siege of Veii, we are told that those who possessed the requisite
                    fortune, but to whom horses had not been assigned, offered to provide these at
                    their on expense. This proposal was accepted; and then it was, according to Livy
                    (v. 7), that they first received regular pay. In 303 B. c. the censors Q. Fabius
                    and P. Decius established a law, by which it was ordained that every fifth year
                    a procession of the equites should take place, and that those who had
                    misconducted themselves should be degraded from their rank. They now evidently
                    became a very powerful body in the state; yet in 186 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b.</hi> c. we find it allowed as a reward to P. AEbutius, that the censor
                    should not assign him a public horse, and thereby compel him to serve as an
                    eques against his will. This proves that the duties must have been burdensome,
                    and regarded by many with distaste. In the later times of the republic they
                    increased in power and consequence, when the judicial functions were transferred
                    from the senate to the body of equites by the Sempronian law, passed by C.
                    Gracchus about 123 <hi rend="smallcaps">b∙</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps">

                    became the farmers of the public revenues, which enabled them to amass immense
                    riches. Sylla deprived them of their judicial powers; but they now possessed too
                    much influence in the state to <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> excluded from the
                    higher and more dignified offices. A tθ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> his death
                    they were again admitted to their former pofl er, which, however, they shared
