                    considerable pashaliks in Armenia, of the same name, which is ruled by a pasha
                    of three tails. It is surrounded on all sides by mountains, the highest peaks of
                    which are covered with snow; and it lies in a valley beneath. The streets are in
                    general paved, and the houses are built of stone, with rafters of wood and
                    terraces. On the tops of these the grass grows, and they afford pasture for
                    sheep; so that when seen from a distance they appear to form part of the plain
                    in front of the town, which is about twenty miles in circumference, and is
                    embellished with upwards of sixty villages. Towards the south the town is
                    protected by a citadel, mounting twenty pieces of cannon of different calibres.
                    It is surrounded by a double wall of stone, and has four gates covered with
                    plates of iron. On the eastern face this work assumes a modern appearance,
                    having regular embrasures; but, from its want of solidity, it is equally
                    defenceless with any other part of the castle. In the eastern part of the city
                    is an old brick tower, the loftiest building in the place, with a clock on the
                    summit which strikes the hours with tolerable regularity. It contains forty-five
                    mosques and two churches. Two of the most ancient of the mosques are beautifully
                    ornamented with bricks and coloured tiles, which lofty domes, together with the
                    glittering minarets of others, give a delusive appearance of splendour to the
                    city when seen from a little distance, which totally vanishes on a nearer view.
                    There are, besides, a Greek church and a large Arminian chapel; and at some
                    distance from the city are three celebrated monasteries. The bazars are
                    extensive, and well supplied with provisions, excepting fruit, which is brought
                    by the Georgians from the province of Akiska, a distance of three or four days’
                    journey. It has manufactures of considerable importance, and carries on an
                    extensive trade in copper, and in articles from Persia, and from the countries
                    to the north-west of Hindustan. In winter the cold is intense; it commences in
                    August, and snow lies on the ground from October to</p>
                <p part="N">March. The air is however pure, the water good, and the inhabitants in
                    general healthy. The town was visited by the plague in 1807, which carried off a
                    great number of the inhabitants. The population amounts, according to some, to
                    100,000 or 130,000, and consists of Turks, Greeks, Persians, and Armenians. Sir
                    R. K. Porter’s estimate is only 6000 Christians and 50,000 Mahommedans. It is
                    two hundred and fifty miles north-north-east of Aleppo Long. 40. 57. E. Lat. 39.
