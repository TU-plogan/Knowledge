                <p part="N"><label type="entry">HYPERIDES</label>, a celebrated orator of Athens,
                    was son of Glaucippus, respecting whose private history we are able to collect a
                    few facts from the Orations of Demosthenes and the Bibliotheca of Photius (p.
                    1479). The exact date of his birth is not known; but he was put to death <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c. 322, the same year in which Demosthenes poisoned
                    himself. He studied philosophy under Plato, but not along with Isocrates, as is
                    stated by Photius; for Isocrates was born <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 436,
                    and must have been far advanced in years when Hyperides was born. Hyperides
                    adopted the same line of politics as Demosthenes, and opposed with great
                    perseverance the proceedings of Philip of Macedon. That monarch, dreading lest
                    the Athenians should be inclined to throw obstacles in the way of his projects,
                    took into his pay many of the chief orators of Athens, at the head of whom was
                    AEschines. Demostlιenes, who was chief of the opposite party, recommended an
                    alliance with the king of Persia, whose dominions were equally threatened by
                    Philip; and it would appear that Hyperides and Ephialtes were employed in ą
                    secret negotiation for this purpose. When Euboea was threatened with invasion by
                    Philip, Hyperidcs, finding that the Athenians were wasting the time in vain
                    debates, had sufficient influence with the richer citizens to prevail upon them
                    to fit out a fleet of forty triremes, two of which he equipped at his own
                    expense. He was employed under Phocion, in the expedition which was sent to the
                    assistance of Byzantium, when it was besieged by Philip, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.

                    his energetic means that Athens obtained an honourable peace. He was afterwards
                    accused by Aristogeiton of having violated at this period all the laws of the
                    republic; but in his defence he made that celebrated reply, that he had been
                    dazzled by the arms of the Macedonians, and that it was not he, but the battle
                    of Chaeronea, which had caused the decree to pass of which he was now accused.
                    He was onc of the few whose lives were demanded of the Athenians by Alexander,
                    after the destruction of Thebes, n. c. 335; but it appears that Demades
                    contrived to appease the wrath of the prince, and Hyperides was allowed to
                    remain in his country. He seems to have been honourably distinguished from the
                    orators of his time by an entire freedom from avarice; he resisted the bribes of
                    Harpalus, and was therefore employed to prosecute those who had allowed
                    themselves to be corrupted; he was also one of the accusers of Demosthenes. The
                    troops, however, which Harpalus had brought with him he advised the Athenians to
                    retain; and by means of these, upon the death of Alexander, <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    Leosthenes the general fell, with many of his troops; and the funeral oration
                    which was pronounced over them by Hyperides was considered by the ancients as
                    one of the most beautiful of its kind. After the defeat of the Greeks, Hyperides
                    was banished from Athens; and having retired to AEgina, was there reconciled to
                    Demosthenes. Being pursued by the Macedonians, he fled to the Temple of Neptune
                    at Hermina, and he was there seized by Archias, who carried him to Corinth,
                    where Antipater then was. Being subjected to torture, some say that he bit off
                    his tongue, that he might not be induced to betray the secrets of his country;
                    whilst others assert that it was cut out by order of Antipater, and that he was
                    then put to death, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 322. Cicero places him
                    immediately after Demosthenes as an orator. There were fifty-two orations of his
                    extant in the time of Photius, and twenty-five others whļch Photius did not
                    consider as genuine. None of his works have been preserved.</p>
