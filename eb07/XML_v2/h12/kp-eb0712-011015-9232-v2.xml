                    time of Augustus. Suetonius, in his work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Illustribus Grammaticis,</hi> says that he was by birth a
                    Spaniard; but some think that he was a native of Alexandria in Egypt. He was
                    originally a slave of Julius Caesar, who brought him to Rome; but having
                    distinguished himself by his literary acquirements, he was emancipated by
                    Augustus, and placed at the head of the library which that sovereign had founded
                    in the temple of the Palatine Apollo. Whilst in this situation, he became
                    intimate with Ovid the poet; and Caius Licinius, a man of consular rank, has
                    informed us that he died very poor, having been supported by the bounty of his
                    friends; but some think that Caius Licinius is a mistake for Caius Asinius, who
                    wrote a history of the civil war, and served as consul with Cneius Domitius
                    Calvinus, in the year of the city 723. It is doubtful whether the works which
                    have been preserved under his name are really the productions of the freedman of
                    Augustus. These are <hi rend="italic">Fabularum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Liber,</hi> a collection of two hundred and seventy-seven fables,
                    principally derived from Greek sources, and which are of great value in
                    mythological inquiries; and <hi rend="italic">Poeticon Astronomicon,</hi> an
                    astronomical and mathematical work in prose. He is also supposed to have written
                    on the subject of agriculture, and to have composed a book of Genealogies, of
                    which mention is made in the <hi rend="italic">Poeticon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Astronomicon.</hi> Of this last work, the first book treats of the world
                    and the doctrine of the sphere, and the second of the signs in the zodiac; the
                    third contains a history and description of the constellations, and the fourth
                    treats of the several things relating to the planets. But whilst Hyginus
                    describes the constellations in the heavens, and enumerates the stars belonging
                    to each, he takes occasion to explain the fables of the poets from which these
                    constellations were supposed to have originally derived their names, and it is
                    probably owing to this circumstance that the work has been denominated <hi
                        rend="italic">Poeticon Astronomicon.</hi> It has however come down to us in
                    a very imperfect state; and all that part of it which treated of the month, the
                    year, and the reasons for intercalating the months, has been entirely lost. To
                    the <hi rend="italic">Poeticon Astronomicon</hi> is usually appended a book of
                    fables, containing a compendium of the heathen mythology; but this is also
                    imperfect, and is moreover suspected to be spurious. <hi rend="italic">Υ</hi><hi

                        >Fabularum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Poeticon Astronornicon</hi> have
                    been published together at Basle, 1555, and at Hamburg, 1674; and separately at
                    Paris, 1578, and at Leyden, 1670. The best editions are those which appeared
                    with the commentary of Muncker, in a collection entitled <hi rend="italic"

                    Staveren, Leyden, 1763. There are other works under the name of Hyginus, but
                    they all belong to a later age: <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Vatican, has added three new works on mythology to those which we already
                    possessed, and one of these is under the name of Hyginus, but evidently by a
                    writer of the fifth century. Other manuscripts of the same works have since been
                    discovered at Göttingen, Gothe, and Paris; and Dr Bode has published a new
                    edition, with a careful collation of these manuscripts, <hi rend="italic"
