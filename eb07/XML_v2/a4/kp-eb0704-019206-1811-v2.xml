                    illustrious father of the church, was born at Thagaste, a city of Numidia, on
                    the 13th of November 354. His father, a burgess of that city, was called <hi
                        rend="italic">Patricius,</hi> and his mother <hi rend="italic">Monica,</hi>
                    who being a woman <hi rend="italic">of</hi> great virtue, instructed him in the
                    principles of the Christian religion. In his early youth, while in the rank of
                    the. catechumens, he fell dangerously ill, and earnestly desiι ed to be
                    baptized; but the violence of the distemper ceasing, his baptism was delayed.
                    His father, who had not yet been baptized, made him study at Thagaste, Madaura,
                    and afterwards at Carthage. Augustine having read Cicero s books of philosophy,
                    began to entertain a love for wisdom, and applied himself to the study of the
                    Holy Scriptures; nevertheless, he suffered himself to be seduced by the
                    Manicheans. At the age of nineteen he returned to Thagaste, where he gave
                    instructions in grammar,; and also frequented the bar: he afterwards taught
                    rhetoric atCarthage with applause. The insolence of the scholars at Carthage
                    made him take a resolution to go to Rome, though against his mother’s will. Here
                    also he had many scholars; but disliking them, he quitted Rome, and settling at
                    Milan, was chosen public professor of rhetoric in that city. Here he had
                    opportunities of hearing the sermons of St Ambrose, which, together with the
                    study of St Paul’s epistles, and the conversion of two of his friends,
                    determined him to retract his errors, and quit the sect of the Manicheans: this
                    was in the thirty-second year of his age. In the vacation of the year 386 he
                    retired to the house of a friend of his named Verecundus, where he seriously
                    applied himself to the study of the Christian religion, in order to prepare
                    himself for baptism, which he received at Easter in the year 387. Soon after
                    this his mother came to see him at Milan, and invite him back to Carthage; but
                    at Ostia, whither he went to embark in order to return, she died. He arrived in
                    Africa about the end of the year 388; and having obtained a garden-plot without
                    the walls of the city of Hippo, he associated himself with eleven otherpersons
                    of eminent sanctity, who distinguished themselves by wearing leathern girdles,
                    and lived there in a monastic way for the space of three years; exercising
                    themselves in fasting, prayer, study, and meditation, day and night. Hence
                    sprung the Augustine friars, or eremites of St Augustine, who were the first
                    order of mendicants; those of St Jerome, the Carmelites, and others, being but
                    branches of that of St Augustine. About this time, or before, Valerius, bishop
                    of Hippo, ordained him priest much against his inclination: nevertheless he
                    continued to reside in his little monastery with his brethren, who, renouncing
                    all property, possessed their goods in common. Valerius, who had appointed St
                    Augustine to preach in his place, allowed him to do it in his presence, contrary
                    to the custom of the churches in Africa. Hé explained the creed in a general
                    council of Africa held in 393. Two years after, Valerius, fearing he might be
                    preferred to be bishop of another church, appointed him his coadjutor or
                    colleague, and caused him to be ordained bishop of Hippo, by Mega-lus, bishop of
                    Calame, then primate of Numidia. St Augustine died on the 28th of August 430,
                    aged seventy-six years; having had the misfortune to see his country invaded by
                    the Vandals, and the city where he was bishop besieged for seven months. The
                    works of St Augustine extend to ten volumes: the best edition of them is that of
                    Maurin, printed at Antwerp in 1700.</p>
