                    Baiae, famous among the ancients for its poisonous qualities. It is described by
                    Strabo as situated within the Lucrine Bay, deep and darksome, surrounded with
                    steep overhanging banks, and only accessible by the narrow passage through which
                    you sail in. Black aged groves stretched their boughs over the watery abyss, and
                    with impenetrable foliage excluded almost every ray of wholesome light; and
                    mephitic vapours ascending from the hot bowels of the earth, being denied free
                    passage to the upper atmosphere, floated along the surface in poisonous mists.
                    These circumstances produced horrors fit for such gloomy deities; while a colony
                    of Cimmerians, as well suited to the rites as the place itself, cut dwellings in
                    the bosom of the surrounding hills, and officiated as priests of Tartarus.
                    Superstition, always delighting in dark ideas, early and eagerly seized upon
                    this noxious spot, and hither she led her trembling votaries to celebrate her
                    dismal orgies. Here she evoked the manes of departed heroes; here she offered
                    sacrifices to the gods of the infernal regions, and attempted to dive into the
                    secrets of futurity. Poets enlarged upon the popular theme, and painted its
                    awful scenery with the strongest colours of their art. Homer brings Ulysses to
                    Avcrnus, as to the mouth of the infernal abodes; and, in imitation of the
                    Grecian bard, Virgil conducts his hero to the same gloomy regions. Whoever
                    sailed thither, first did sacrifice, and endeavoured to propitiate the infernal
                    powers, with the assistance of some priests, who attended upon the place and
                    directed the mystic performance. Within, a fountain of pure water broke out just
                    over the sea, which was fancied to be a vein of the river Styx. Near this
                    fountain was the oracle; and the hot waters, frequent in those parts, were
                    supposed to be branches of the burning Phlegethon. The poisonous effluvia from
                    this lake were said to be so strong that they proved fatal to birds endeavouring
                    to fly over it. Virgil ascribes the exhalation, not to the lake itself, but to
                    the cavern near it, which was called <hi rend="italic">Avernus,</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">Cave of the Sybil,</hi> and through which the poets feigned a
                    descent to Orcus. Hence the proper name of the lake is <hi rend="italic">Lacus
                        Averni,</hi> the lake near the cavern, as it is called by some ancient
                    authors.</p>
                <p part="N">The sanctity of these shades remained unimpeachedfor many ages. Hannibal
                    marched his army to offer incense at this altar; but it may be suspected he was
                    led to such an act of devotion rather by the hopes of surprising the garrison of
                    Puteoli, than by his piety. After a long reign of undisturbed gloom and
                    celebrity, a sudden glare of light was let in upon Avernus; the horrors were
                    dispelled, and with them vanished the sanctity of the lake. The axe of Agrippa
                    levelled its forest with the ground, disturbed its sleepy waters with ships, and
                    gave room for all its malignant effluvia to escape. The virulence of these
                    exhalations, as described by ancient authors, has appeared so very
                    extraordinary, that some modern writers, who know the place in a cleared state
                    only, charge these accounts with exaggeration; but others think them entitled to
                    more respect, since even now the air is feverish and dangerous, as the jaundiced
                    faces of the vine-dressers, who have succeeded the Sybils and Cimmerians in the
                    possession of the temple, most ruefully testify.</p>
