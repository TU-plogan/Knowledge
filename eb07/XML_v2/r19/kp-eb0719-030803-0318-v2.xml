                <p part="N"><label type="entry">ROCKY</label> Mountains, a great mountain chain
                    which traverses the western part of North America, extending from about latitude
                    70° north to Mexico, where it is continued by the Cordilleras of the Andes.
                    These ranges are considered as forming part of one vast chain, which in South
                    America, near the equator, attains its greatest elevation. At the Isthmus of
                    Panama it is so low as nearly to disappear; but this is in conformity with the
                    narrowness of the land in that quarter, and but for a short space. This slight
                    interruption is not sufficient to entitle us to consider the continuity as
                    broken, so that we have in the western hemisphere one great mountain range
                    extending along both continents, from the Polar Sea on the north, to Cape Horn
                    on the south, a distance of more than one hundred and twenty degrees of
                    latitude, without including the windings. The eastern side of North America is
                    traversed by a similar range of mountains called the Alleghanies, which stretch
                    along in continued and parallel lines; but the extent, breadth, and height of
                    the Rocky Mountains are much greater than those of the former. It is however
                    supposed that the Rocky Mountains extend along the western part of the
                    continent, at about the same distance from the Pacific Ocean that the
                    Alleghanies on the eastern side extend from the Atlantic Ocean. Although but
                    partially explored, the primitive character of the Rocky Mountains is clearly
                    established. Their eastern sides are covered to the height of two hundred or
                    three hundred feet, with a sandstone consisting of the ruins of the granitic
                    rocks upon which it reposes, where disintegration was apparently effected by the
                    gradual agency of an ancient ocean, once occupying the immense plain or basin
                    now extending eastward from the base of these mountains to the chain of the
                    Alleghanies. They have not however been sufficiently explored to admit our
                    advancing any scientific details in regard to them. Many of the detached
                    mountains and prominent peaks have not yet been either named, classified, or
                    described. It does not appear that many of them rise above the region of
                    perpetual refrigeration. But we have the concurrent testimony of Lewis and
                    Clarke, as well as others, that in latitude 47 <hi rend="superscript">c</hi>
                    north, immense quantities of snow are on their summits, between the Missouri and
                    Columbia, in the months of June and July. They are seen like a vast rampart
                    rising from the grassy plains, stretching from north to soutll. Sometimes their
                    aspect is that of continued ranges of a grayish colour, rising into the blue of
                    the atmosphere, above the region of the clouds. A grcat number are black,
                    ragged, and precipitous; and their bases are strewn with· immense boulders and
                    fragments of rock, detached by earthquakes and the elements. From this
                    iron-bound and precipitous character they probably received the appellation of
                    Rocky Mountains. Some of the peaks are supposed to be twelve or thirteen
                    thousand feet in height; and the general range is considerably higher than any
                    other in North America, with the exception of the <pb break="no"

                    any of them are volcanic. Pumice stones are often seen floating on the
                    Mississippi, and still oftener on the Missouri. These are generally of a reddish
                    yellow, or flame colour, and are amongst the largest and finest specimens of
                    this substance to be met with. Some assert that they proceed from hills of
                    burning coal, but we never heard of hills of burning coal ever yielding such a
                    product. They are entirely a volcanic production, and beyond doubt are either
                    discharged from craters at present active, or are washed away by the mountain
                    torrents, from places which were formerly the scene of such phenomena. Mica is
                    also abundantly carried along by the waters which flow from the Rocky Mountains.
                    The great rivers that are discharged from their eastern and western declivities
                    wind among the mountains, the Arkansas on the east, and the Oregon or Columbia
                    on the west, more than a hundred leagues before they issue into the plains. In
                    following the beds of such streams, travellers passthrough the range without
                    much difficulty, so that the reports of the early travellers that they presented
                    a high, continuous, and almost impassable barrier, are incorrect. Various
                    leaders of expeditions have passed them at different points, and affirm that
                    they found no such formidable and insurmountable barriers, the mention of which
                    was wont to deter traders from attempting to cross from east to west or from
                    west to east by this route. Following the river Platt, which is one of the
                    principal southern branches of the Missouri, the traveller finds a road even to
                    Lake Buenaventura, on the Pacific plains, that needs little labour to adapt it
                    to the passage of horses and waggons. The acclivity is nowhere so great as to
                    exceed an ascent of three degrees.</p>
                <p part="N">This vast range has been divided into the Rocky, Chepy-wan, and Masserne

                    The ranges on the south, at the sources of the Arkansas, and running thence
                    towards the Gulf of Mexico, are called the Masserne Mountains. A single peak of
                    this ridge, seen as a landmark for immense distances over the subjacent plains,
                    is called Mount Pike, a very appropriate name. It is described as of
                    incomparable grandeur in appearance, and has been differently estimated at from
                    seven to ten thousand feet in height. On the ridges of the Rocky Mountains, the
                    Colorado of the Pacific, the Rio del Norte of Mexico, the Roche-jaune or
                    Yellow-stone of the Missouri, and the Arkansas and Red River of the Mississippi,
                    streams which have outlets at such immense distances apart, all have their
                    origin. Many accounts have been given of the appearance of silver and other
                    metals in the Rocky Mountains, but they have been too partially explored to
                    entitle us to pronounce on the extent or value of the veins. (r. r. r.)</p>
