                        the protection of the elector of Bavaria, was considered as an imperial
                        city, and the diets of the German empire were frequently held within it. It
                        was then the see of an archbishop, and remarkable for its zealous adherence
                        to the Catholic church. It was the scene of one of the most bloody conflicts
                        during the Thirty Years’ War, when the army of the imperial general

                        works, and lost so many men that he was compelled to retreat. It suffered
                        much during the war between the French and Austrians in 1809.</hi></p>

                    river Danube, both upwards as far as Ulm, and downwards as far as Vienna.</p>
                <p part="N">The city stands on the river Danube, at the spot where the river Regen
                        <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> from which its German name is derived, falls
                    into that great stream. The bridge over the Danube connects the several parts of
                    the city. It is still in an imperfect degree fortified, but is totally
                    indefensible against any armed force. The buildings are of antique models,
                    particularly the ancient council-house, in which the representatives of all the
                    states of Germany were accustomed to assemble. The cathedral is a large Gothic
                    building; as are the church of St Emeran and the Lutheran church of the Holy
                    Trinity, the latter of which was the college of the Jesuits till the abolition
                    of the order.</p>
                <p part="N">The population, which in 1811 amounted to 18,843 persons, has much
                    increased, and was found in 1837 to be 26,550. Of these, about one third are
                    Lutherans; and two thirds, comprehending almost the whole of the labouring
                    classes, are Roman Catholics. The former party have a gymnasium, and the latter
                    a lyceum. There is a learned society, who have a botanical garden and a
                    respectable library, with a museum of mathematical and philosophical
                    instruments, and a picture-gallery. There are manufactures of morocco leather,
                    many tanneries, soap-makers, wax and tallow chandlers, with large breweries and
                    distilleries. On the banks of the Danube are some establishments for building
                    barques and boats for navigating that river. The transit trade between eastern
                    and western Germany gives employment to several respectable mercantile houses. A
                    project, now considerably advanced, gives hope to the inhabitants of this city
                    of a much greater portion of transit commerce. The Royal Bavarian Canal is
                    hastening to its completion, and will open a communication by water between the
                    Rhine and the Danube, the whole length being within the dominions of Bavaria. It
                    commences at the river Mayn, which empties itself into the Rhine, and will
                    terminate in the Danube, near this city. It is hoped that the timber of Bavaria
                    will thus find a market in Hungary, and the surplus corn of that kingdom a
                    constant vent on the banks of the Rhine, especially in Holland.</p>
