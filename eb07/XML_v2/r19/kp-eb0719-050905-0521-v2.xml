                <p part="N"><label type="entry">ROWE</label> Nicholas, was descended of an ancient
                    family in Devonshire, and born in 1673. He acquired a complete taste for the
                    classical authors under Dr Busby in Westminster school; but poetry was his early
                    and darling study. His father, who was a lawyer, entered him a student in the
                    Middle Temple, and he made remarkable advances in the study of the law; but the
                    love of the belles lettres, and of poetry, stopped him in his career. His first
                    tragedy, the Ambitious Stepmother, meeting with universal applause, he laid
                    aside all thoughts of rising by the law, and afterwards composed several
                    tragedies; but that which he valued himself most upon was his Tamerlane. The
                    others were, the Fair Penitent, Ulysses, the Royal Convert, Jane Shore, and Lady
                    Jane Grey. He also wrote a poem called the Biter, and several poems upon
                    different subjects, which have been published under the title of Miscellaneous
                    Works, in one volume, as his dramatic works have been in two. Rowe is chiefly to
                    be considered in the light of a tragic writer and a translator. In his attempt
                    at comedy, he failed so igno-miniously that his Biter is not inserted in his
                    works; and his occasional poems and short compositions are rarely worthy either
                    of praise or censure, for they seem to be the casual sports of a mind seeking
                    rather to amuse its leisure than to exercise its powers. In the construction of
                    his dramas there is not much art; and he is not a nice observer of the unities.
                    I know not, says Dr Johnson, that there can be found in his plays any deep
                    search into nature, any accurate discrimination of kindred qualities, or nice
                    display of passion in its progress. All is general and undefined. Nor does he
                    much interest or affect the auditor, except in Jane Shore, who is always seen
                    and heard with pity. Alicia is a character of empty noise, with no resemblance
                    to real sorrow or to natural madness. Whence then has Rowe acquired his
                    reputation? From the reasonableness and propriety of some of his scenes, from
                    the elegance of his diction, and from the suavity of his verse. He seldom moves
                    either pity or terror, but he often elevates the sentiment; he seldom pierces
                    the breast, but he always delights the ear, and often improves the
                    understanding. Being a great admirer of Shakspeare, he gave the public an
                    edition of his plays, to which he prefixed an account of his life. But the most
                    considerable of Mr Rowe’s performances was a translation of Lucan’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Pharsalia,</hi> which he just lived to finish, but not to
                    publish; for it did not appear in print till 1728, ten years after his
                    death.</p>
                <p part="N">In the meanwhile, the love of poetry and books did not make him unfit
                    for business; for nobody applied closer to it when occasion required. The Duke
                    of Queensberry, when secretary of state, made him secretary for public affairs.
                    But after the duke’s death, all avenues to his preferment were stopped; and
                    during the remainder of Queen Anne’s reign he passed his time with the Muses and
                    his books. On the accession of George I., however, he was made poet-laureat, and
                    one of the land-surveyors of the customs in the port of London. The Prince of
                    Wales conferred on him the clerkship of his council; and the Lord Chancellor
                    Parker made him his secretary for the presentations. But he did not enjoy these
                    promotions long; for he died on the 6th of December 1718, being then in his
                    forty-fifth year.</p>
                <p part="N">Mr Rowe, who was twice married, had a son by his first wife, and a

                    person. He lived beloved; and at his death he had the honour to be lamented by
                    Pope, in an epitaph which is printed in Pope’s works, although it was not
                    affixed on Mr Rowe’s monument in Westminster Abbey, where he was interred, in
                    the poets’ corner, opposite to Chaucer.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Rowe,</hi><hi rend="italic">Elizabeth,</hi> an
                    English lady, eminent for her writings both in prose and verse, was born at
                    Ilchester, in Somersetshire, in 1674, being the daughter of worthy parents, Mr
                    Walter Singer and Mrs Elizabeth Portnel. There being a great affinity between
                    painting and poetry, this lady, who had a vein for the one, naturally had a
                    taste for the other. She was also very fond of music, chiefly of the grave and
                    solemn kind, as best suited the grandeur of her sentiments and the sublimity of
                    her devotion. But poetry was her favourite employment, her distinguishing
                    excellence; and so prevalent was her genius this way, that her prose is all
                    poetical. In 1696, a collection of her poems was published at the desire of two
                    friends. Her paraphrase on the thirty-eighth chapter of Job w <hi
                        rend="superscript">r</hi> as written at the request of Bishop Ken. She had
                    no other tutor for the French and Italian languages than Mr Thynne, who
                    willingly took the trouble upon himself. Her shining merit, with the charms of
                    her person and conversation, had procured her many admirers. Amongst others, it
                    is said, the famous Mr Prior made his addresses to her; but Mr Thomas Rowe was
                    destined to be the happy man. This gentleman was honourably descended; and his
                    superior genius, and insatiable thirst after knowledge, were conspicuous in his
                    earliest years. He had formed a design to compile the lives of all the
                    illustrious persons in antiquity omitted by Plutarch; which, indeed, he partly
                    executed, and eight lives were published after his decease. They were translated
                    into French by the Abbé Bellenger in 1734. He spoke with ease and fluency, and
                    had a trank and benevolent temper, an inexhaustible fund of wit, and a
                    communicative disposition. Such was the man who, charmed with the person,
                    character, and writings of our authoress, married her in 1710, and made it his
                    study to repay the felicity with which she crowned his life. But too intense an
                    application to study, beyond what the delicacy of his frame would bear, broke
                    his health, and threw him into a consumption, which put a period to his life in
                    May 1715, when he had but just passed the twenty-eighth year of his age. Mrs
                    Rowe wrote a beautiful elegy on his death; and continued to the last moments of
                    her life to express the highest veneration and affection for his memory. As soon
                    after his decease as her affairs would permit, she indulged her inclination for
                    solitude by retiring to Frome, in Somersetshire, in the neighbourhood of which
                    place lay the greatest part of her estate. In this recess it was that she
                    composed the most celebrated of her works, Friendship in Death, and the Letters
                    Moral and Entertaining. In 1736, she published the History of Joseph, a poem
                    which she had written in her younger years. But she did not long survive this
                    publication; for she died of an apoplexy, as was supposed, on the 20th
                    ofFebruary 1736-1737. In her cabinet were found letters to several of her
                    friends, which she had ordered to be delivered immediately after her decease. Dr
                    Isaac Watts, agreeably to her request, revised and published, in 1737, her
                    devotions, under the title of Devout Exercises of the Heart in Meditation and
                    Soliloquy, Praise and Prayer; and, in 1739, her Miscellaneous Works, in prose
                    and verse, were published in two volumes 8vo, with an account of her life and
                    writings prefixed.</p>
