                    writer, was born at Tours in 1621. He taught polite literature in the society of
                    the Jesuits with great applause, and was justly esteemed one of the best Latin
                    poets and greatest wits of his time. He died at Paris in the year 1687. His
                    principal works were, 1. A great number of Latin poems, which have rendered him
                    famous throughout all Europe, amongst which are his <hi rend="italic">Hortorum
                        Iibri quatuor;</hi> 2. Reflections on Eloquence, Poetry, History, and
                    Philosophy; 3. Comparisons between Virgil and Homer, Demosthenes and Cicero,
                    Plato and Aristotle, Thucydides and Titus Livius; 4. The History of Jansenism;
                    and, 5. Several works on religious subjects. The best edition of his Latin poems
                    is that of Paris in 1723, in three vols, l2mo.</p>

                    Thoyras, and was born at Castres in 1661. He was at first educated under a tutor
                    in his father’s house, and afterwards sent to Puylaurens, and thence to Samur.
                    In 1679 he returned to his father, with a design to apply himself to the study
                    of the law <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> , and was admitted an advocate; but
                    some time afterwards, reflecting that his being a Protestant would prevent∙his
                    advancement at the bar, he resolved to quit the profession of the law, and to
                    apply himself to that of the sword. His father, however,</p>
                <p part="N">, would not consent to the change. The revocation of the edict of Nantes
                    in 1685, and the death of his father, which happened two months afterwards, made
                    him resolve to come to England; but as he had no hopes of any settlement there,
                    his stay was but short. He therefore went to Holland, and enlisted himself in
                    the company of French volunteers at Utrecht, commanded by M. Rapin, his
                    cousin-german. He attended the Prince of Orange into England in 1688; and the
                    follow’ing year Lord Kingston made him an ensign in his regiment, with which he
                    proceeded to Ireland, where he gained the esteem Ofhisofficers at the siege
                    OfCarrickfergus, and soon received a lieutenant’s commission. He was present at
                    the battle of the Boyne, and was shot through the shoulder at the siege of
                    Limerick. He was soon afterwards made captain of the company in which he had
                    been ensign; but, in 1693, he resigned his company to one of his brothers, in
                    order to become tutor to the Earl of Portland’s son. In 1699, he married
                    Marianne Testard; but this marriage neither abated his care of his pupil, nor
                    prevented his accompanying him in his travels. Having finished this employment,
                    he returned to his family, which he had settled at the Hague; and there he
                    continued some years. But as he found his family increase, he resolved to retire
                    to some cheap country; and accordingly removed, in 1707, to Wesel, where he
                    wrote his History of England, and some other works. Though he was of a strong
                    constitution, yet seventeen ycars <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> application, for
                    so long was he engaged in composing his .great work, entirely ruined his health.
                    He died in 1725.</p>
                <p part="N">Rapin wrote, in French, 1. A Dissertation on IheWhigsand Tories; 2. His
                    History of England, printed at the Hague in 1726 and 1727, in nine vols. 4to,
                    and reprinted at Trevoux in 1728, in ten vols. 4to. This' last edition is more
                    complete than that of the Hague. It has been translated into English, and
                    improved with notes, by Mr Tindal, in two vols. folio. This performance,
                    although the work of a foreigner, is deservedly esteemed as the fullest and most
                    impartial collection of English political transactions extant.</p>
