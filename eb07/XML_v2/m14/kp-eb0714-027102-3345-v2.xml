                    singular feature, being completely though irregularly divided in its whole
                    length from north to south by Chesapeake Bay, perhaps the finest estuary in the
                    world. These distinct portions are called, according to their situation, the
                    eastern and western shores. These shores may be considered as recent alluvium;
                    and the country is low and level, permeated by tide-rivers and creeks. Above
                    tidewater the land becomes agreeably undulating, rising, though not very
                    rapidly, into hills which reach the foot of the Alleghany and the Blue
                    Mountains. These ranges cross the western part of the state, thus constituting a
                    third or mountainous region. They are in no place less than 2486 feet above the
                    level of the sea, and in many places they exceed 3000 feet. Each zone has
                    portions of highly productive soil, but in general the intermediate valleys of
                    the mountainous part are the most fertile. The counties of Frederick and
                    Washington have limestone tracts, which exhibit a fertility not to be surpassed
                    by any in the United States. The hilly zone is exceedingly variable, and within
                    very narrow limits are found the extremes of fertility and barrenness. All the
                    uneven country abounds with springs of excellent water. No part of the marine
                    and river alluvial section is so productive as the calcareous parts of the
                    western region, but there is more uniformity of soil than obtains in the middle
                    zone. The country on the eastern side of the Chesapeake, with the exception of a
                    small part of the northern extremity, is an extensive plain, low and sandy, much
                    intersected by rivers and creeks, possessing few springs, and abounding in
                    stagnant water. The western shore of the Chesapeake, below the falls, resembles
                    the eastern; but it is far from being a dead plain, though none of the hills are
                    of any considerable elevation. From the diversity of soil, as well as from the
                    elevation of some parts, the vegetable productions have been much varied, and
                    the staples greatly multiplied.</p>
                <p part="N">Potomac, the largest river of the state, rises in the mountain chain
                    which traverses its western part, and in its whole length, which is between
                    three and four hundred miles, constitutes the boundary between Maryland and
                    Virginia. At Washington it is above a mile in breadth, and at about ninety miles
                    below that city it falls into Chesapeake Bay. The Susquehannah likewise falls
                    into the same estuary, but only a small portion of the northern extremity of
                    Maryland is traversed by that noble stream. Two considerable rivers, the
                    Choptank and the Nanticoke, rise in Delaware, and taking their course through
                    the eastern part of Maryland, fall into Chesapeake Bay. The western shore is
                    traversed by a great number of streams of various extent, but none of them are
                    of any great magnitude. With regard to climate, the higher parts of the state
                    are esteemed salubrious; as is also the middle zone; but the low-lying parts on
                    either side of Chesapeake Bay are unhealthy. The air in summer is moist, sultry,
                    and disagreeable; and the inhabitants are subject to agues and intermittent
                    fevers, whilst many of them have a wan and sickly aspect. The maritime belt of
                    Maryland may be said to belong rather to the southern than to the northern
                    states.</p>
                <p part="N">The soil is generally a red clay or loam, and much of it is of excellent
                    quality. The staple products of the state are wheat and tobacco; but maize,
                    sweet potatoes, hemp, flax, and some cotton for domestic use, are likewise
                    raised. The genuine white wheat, said to be peculiar to Maryland, is grown in
                    some of the counties on the eastern shore. The soil and climate are admirably
                    adapted for the cultivation of all the fruits of the temperate zone; and here
                    accordingly are fine orchards, in which apples, pears, peaches, plums, and
                    cherries, are abundant. Of peaches, the inhabitants make large quantities of
                    peach brandy; and of apples, apple brandy and cider. The forests abound in
                    hickory trees, and also in that production called <hi rend="italic">mast,</hi> a
                    nutbearing tree, on which great numbers of swine are fed. These animals are
                    allowed to run wild, and when fattened are killed, barrelled, and exported in
                    great quantities. Sheep and oxen are also plentiful. In the swamps the cypress
                    is common, and the catalpa is indigenous to the soil.</p>
                <p part="N">Ί here are a number of long turnpikes in this state, particularly one
                    which connects Baltimore with Cumberland on the Potomac, a distance of 135
                    miles. This constitutes the great thoroughfare to the western country. From
                    Cumberland to Brownsville on the Monongahela, in Pennsylvania, there has been
                    completed by the United States a free road of a most excellent construction. The
                    distance <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203358?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0714-3358-0272"/> is seventy-two miles, making the whole
                    distance from Baltimore to Brownsville 207 miles. Amongst other turnpike roads
                    may be mentioned that which has been made from Baltimore by York· and
                    Pennsylvania to the Snsquehannah, by which large quantities of the produce of
                    Pennsylvania are brought to that city. There are other roads, either in a state
                    of forwardness, or which have recently been completed. The most stupendous work
                    ever undertaken by any government, or by individuals, is the Baltimore and Ohio
                    railroad. The length of this magnificent road, when completed, will be three
                    hundred and thirty miles, and the ground is, besides, both high and difficult.
                    When the project was made known, a company was immediately formed, and capital
                    to a large amount subscribed. The work commenced in 1828, but was for a long
                    time retarded in consequence of a litigation with the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal
                    Company, as to prior right of location in certain parts of the route. The
                    dispute being settled, operations were resumed, and in December 1834 eighty-two
                    miles of the road were completed, at an expense of three milliqns of dollars.
                    The same company have opened a railroad to the city of Washington, commencing
                    eight miles from Baltimore; the length of this work is thirty-two miles. Other
                    railroads have also been undertaken, amongst which may be mentioned one from
                    York-Haven to the Susquehannah, a distance of sixty miles. There are several
                    canals in this state: one from Port Deposit on the east bank of the
                    Sus-quehannalι, proceeds along a line of rapids northward to the boundary line
                    of Maryland and Pennsylvania, a distance of ten miles. At Little or Lower Falls,
                    on the Potomac, three miles above Washington, is a canal two miles and a half
                    long; and at Great Falls, nine miles above, is another, scarcely, however, a
                    mile in length; but there is one in progress, which, if completed, will rival
                    the great railroad before mentioned. This is the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal,
                    which commences'at the Potomac in the federal city, and proceeds along the river
                    near the limits of Maryland and Virginia. It is laid out to pass through the
                    highlands, and over the Alleghanies, not far from the route of the great
                    national road, to meet the Ohio at or near Pittsburgh. The length of the two
                    great works will be nearly the same. To this undertaking the state of Maryland
                    subscribed five hundred thousand dollars. On the 1st of January 1834, about one
                    hundred and nine miles of this canal were completed, at an expense of 3,707,262
                    dollars.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1696, the province appropriated funds for the support of a college
                    and free schools, the former of which had made considerable progress previously
                    to 1776. In 1782, Washington College was established at Chesterton. About two
                    years afterwards, St John’s College was established at Annapolis, and these two
                    uniting together, constituted one university. A fund which had been appropriated
                    for Washington College was withdrawn in 1804; but the state, as an equivalent,
                    allowed the university twelve thousand dollars per annum. In 1813, a tax was
                    laid on bank stock of twenty cents on every hundred dollars, which yields about
                    10,000 dollars annually. The whole of this is appropriated to the support of
                    free and charity schools, and it is equally divided amongst all the counties in
                    the state. There is likewise a school fund, consisting of a sum advanced by
                    Maryland during the late war, and paid by the national government, amounting to
                    75,000 dollars. A law in favour of primary schools was passed in 1825, and has
                    been partially carried into effect in two or three of the counties. In 1833, the
                    legislature of Maryland passed an act by which St John’s College at Annapolis
                    has 3000 dollars secured to it for ever, the money to be paid from the state
                    treasury. In 1834, a geologist was appointed for the state, with a salary of two
                    thousand dollars per annum; and he is instructed to make deposits of his
                    collections in the college cabinet. There are several academies which receive
                    eight hundred dollars yearly from the state treasury. In 1807 the legislature
                    founded in Baltimore a college for the instruction of students in medicine; and
                    a few years afterwards instruction was also given in divinity, law, the arts and
                    sciences; the whole institution being incorporated under the title of the
                    University of Maryland. It is governed by twenty-eight agents and a provost; and
                    efficient professors, with assistants, are appointed to preside over each
                    department of education. The philosophical apparatus is extensive; and the
                    museum contains a very valuable collection of anatomical preparations. The
                    mineralogical collection is also very extensive. The state, a few years ago,
                    granted 30,000 dollars to this rapidly growing institution. Baltimore College, a
                    chartered and respectable seminary, and St Mary’s College, which belongs to the
                    Roman Catholics, are both in a very flourishing state. In addition to the above,
                    there are extensive academies in various places; indeed the arrangements made
                    for the promotion of knowledge reflect the highest credit on the legislature and
                    inhabitants of Maryland. The religious bodies, as is usual throughout all the
                    American states, are numerous. The Roman Catholics have one archbishop, the
                    metropolitan of the United States, and between thirty and forty churches; the
                    Methodists are a numerous sect, the Episcopalians have seventy-five ministers,
                    the Presbyterians eleven, the Baptists twelve, the German Reformed nine, the
                    Unitarians and the New Jerusalem Church one each; there are also some
                    Mennonites, and the Friends are numerous.</p>

                <p part="N">Baltimore, the commercial capital of Maryland, is the third city in the
                    Union in point of population and extent. It is situated on the north shore of
                    the Patapsco, fourteen miles above its entrance into Chesapeake Bay, one hundred
                    and ninety miles south-west of New York, one hundred miles south-west of
                    Philadelphia, and thirty-seven miles north-east of Washington, in latitude 39.
                    17. north, and longitude 76. 36. west. This city has increased in population,
                    and advanced in commercial importance, with almost unexampled rapidity. It i <hi
                        rend="subscript"> s</hi> admirably situated for trade, and it possesses most
                    of that of Maryland, about a half of that of Pennsylvania, and a portion of that
                    of the western states. It is the best market for tobacco in the Union, and the
                    greatest flour market in the world. The harbour is spacious, secure, and
                    commodious, and is defended by a fort. The principal part of the city is divided
                    from the portions styled Old Town and Fell’s Point, by a small river called
                    Jones’ Falls, over which are erected three elegant stone bridges and four wooden
                    ones. The area of the town is a square of four miles, and it is divided into
                    twelve wards. It contains twenty-five public buildings, and forty places of
                    public worship. The Roman Catholic cathedral is a spacious and magnificent
                    building, the largest, it is believed, in the United States. Several of the
                    other churches are also large and beautifully finished. The Exchange is a vast
                    building, and the Athenaeum is a spacious and beautiful structure. Several of
                    the other public buildings are of great size and elegant appearance. Amongst the
                    most conspicuous objects belonging to Baltimore are its monuments. The
                    Washington Monument is a marble column 175 feet in height. The pedestal is fifty
                    feet square and twenty feet in height, and the column fourteen feet in diameter
                    at the summit and twenty at the foot. There is also Battle Monument, raised in
                    memory of those who fell in defence of the city in the attack made upon it by
                    the British in 1814; and a shot tower 234 feet in height. The city, generally,
                    is well built, mostly of brick. Many of the houses, particularly those recently
                    erected, display much elegance and taste. The streets are well paved, and many
                    of them are spacious. Baltimore issues seven or eight gazettes, and has above
                    one hundred manufactories of various kinds, its vicinity affording ample command
                    of water-power for driving mills.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1830, there were inspected 577,804 barrels of wheat flour, 4436
                    barrels of rye flour, 558 hogsheads, and 5458 barrels of corn meal. Vessels of
                    500 or 600 tons burden can lie in perfect safety at the wharfs on the point, but
                    those of only 200 tons can come πp to the town.</p>
                <p part="N">Annapolis, the political metropolis of Maryland, is situated on the
                    western side of the estuary of the Severn, twenty·eight miles south-east of
                    Baltimore, and forty north-east of Washington, in longitude 76.43. west,
                    latitude 39.0. north. It is a pleasant and healthy town, and contains a spacious
                    and elegant town-house, a market, two houses of public worship, and a theatre.
                    Fredericktown, on a branch of the Monococy, is a large and pleasant interior
                    town, forty-five miles west of Baltimore, and forty-three north-west of
                    Washington. It is pleasantly situated, regularly laid out, and well built, and
                    contains a court-house, a jail, a bank, a market-house, an academy, and seven
                    places of public worship for various denominations of Christians. Several of the
                    public buildings, and many of the private houses, are spacious and elegant. This
                    town is situated in the centre of a very pleasant and fertile country, and sends
                    great quantities of wheat and flour to Baltimore; also leather, shoes, saddles,
                    hats, and gloves. Several newspapers are published here. Hagerstown is a very
                    neat place, regularly laid out, on Antietam Creek, sixty-nine miles north-west
                    of Washington, and seventy-one west by north of Baltimore. It contains four
                    public buildings, and four churches, of which two are handsome structures. Being
                    situated in a fertile and well-cultivated tract of country, and one of the best
                    districts in the United States for raising wheat, it has a considerable trade,
                    and is altogether a very flourishing place. Cumberland is a considerable village
                    on the northern bank of the Potomac, at the commencement of the great national
                    road. It contains four public buildings and four churches. Great abundance of
                    stone coal is found in the vicinity. Hancock, on the most northern bend of the
                    Potomac, near the Pennsylvania line, is also, as well as the three
                    last-mentioned towns, on the national road, and is an important village. The
                    names of the other considerable villages in this state are, Elkton, Frenchtown,
                    Charlestown, Chestertown, Easton, Middleton, Salisbury, Princess Anne, and
                    Snowhill. These are on the eastern shore. On the western shore are,
                    Havre-de-Grace, Belle-Air, Harford, Bladensburgh, Port Tobacco, and
                    Leonardtown.</p>
                <p part="N">The district of Columbia is a tract of country ten miles square, nearly
                    equally divided by the Potomac, and ceded by the states of Maryland and Virginia
                    to the general government. Its surface is uneven without being mountainous, and
                    the soil is very light and sandy. It comprehends two counties, Alexandria and
                    Washington, the latter containing the city of Washington, the seat of the
                    general government. Although of little moment in a commercial <pb break="no"

                    view, yet its political importance entitles it to a pretty full description.</p>
                <p part="N">Washington, the metropolis of the United States, is situated on the
                    Maryland side of the Potomac, in latitude 38. 32. 54. north, and longitude 77.
                    1. 48. west from Greenwich. It is 436 miles south-west of Boston, 226 from New
                    York, 136 from Philadelphia, and 37 from Baltimore. Rock Creek divides it from
                    Georgetown, with which it is connected by four bridges; and the Potomac
                    separates it from Alexandria, with which it is connected by a bridge of more
                    than a mile in length. There are also several bridges over the Anacostia. This
                    river has a sufficient depth of water for frigates to ascend above the
                    navy-yard, which is situated upon it. Vessels drawing fourteen feet of water can
                    come up to Potomac Bridge, from which to the mouth of the Tiber there are nine
                    feet of water at ordinary flood tide. A spacious canal unites the Anacostia with
                    the Potomac. The space on which the city is built is high, airy, commanding, and
                    salubrious, and, as but a small part of it is as yet occupied by buildings, it
                    has the aspect of a succession of opulent villages in the midst of the country.
                    Streets running north and south are crossed by others running east and west,
                    whilst those which bear the name of avenues traverse these rectangular divisions
                    diagonally, and are so laid out as to afford the most direct communication
                    between those places deemed the most important, or which offer the most
                    agreeable prospects. Where the avenues form acute angles by their intersections
                    with the streets, there are reservations which are to remain open. The avenues
                    are named after the states of the Union, and the streets are designated
                    numerically or alphabetically, beginning at the Capitol. This magnificent
                    edifice is situated in Capitol Square, a lofty eminence at the head of
                    Pennsylvania Avenue. It is of the Corinthian order, being constructed of
                    freestone, and composed of a centre and two wings. The length of the whole is
                    350 feet, the depth of the wings 121 feet, and the height to the top of the dome
                    120 feet. A Corinthian portico extends along the centre, which is occupied by
                    the rotunda, about ninety-six feet in diameter, and the same number of feet in
                    height. It is ornamented with paintings and relievos, designed to commemorate
                    some of the prominent events in the early history of the country. This
                    magnificent apartment is of white marble, and lighted from the dome, which is
                    lofty and imposing. The chamber of the House of Representatives is one of the
                    richest and most splendid apartments of the kind that has ever been constructed.
                    It occupies the south wing, and is of a semicircular form, ninety-five feet in
                    length, and sixty in height. The dome is supported by twenty-six columns and
                    pilasters of breccia or Potomac marble. A colossal statue of Liberty, and
                    another of History, are the principal embellishments of this hall. The
                    senate-chamber, in the northern wing, is also a semicircle of seventy-four feet
                    in length by forty-two in height. Adjoining the rotunda on the west is the
                    Library of Congress. The hall, ninety-two feet in length, thirty-four in width,
                    and thirty-six in height, contains 16,000 volumes. Immediately beneath the
                    senate-chamber, and nearly of the same form and dimensions, is the room in which
                    the sessions of the supreme court are held. The president’s house is an elegant
                    mansion, 180 feet in length by eighty-five feet in width, and two stories high.
                    Four brick buildings of the same height, with free-stone basements and Ionic
                    porticos, contain the offices of the principal executive departments. The
                    General Post-office is a large brick edifice, situated nearly a mile north-west
                    of the Capitol, in which are the chambers of the post-office establishment, the
                    general land-office, and the patent-office. The navy-yard is situated on the
                    eastern branch of the Potomac, and is provided with all the appurtenances
                    necessary for building ships of the largest size. To the north of it are the
                    marine barracks, an arsenal, public manufactories of arms, military stores, and
                    the like. The city-hall is ai large edifice, and amongst the other public
                    buildings, which are numerous, may be enumerated four market-houses, twenty
                    churches, an orphan asylum, an alms-house, and the Columbian College, which is
                    situated on elevated ground to the north of the city. It is a lofty building,
                    and has four instructors, and about fifty students. There are also two Roman
                    Catholic institutions under the care of the Sisters of Charity. In August 1814,
                    Washington was taken by the British under General Ross, who set fire to the
                    Capitol, the president’s house, and other public offices. The Library of
                    Congress was burned at this time, and that of Mr Jefferson was subsequently
                    purchased to replace it.</p>
                <p part="N">Georgetown is situated on the north-eastern bank of the Potomac, three
                    miles west of the Capitol in Washington, in longitude 75. 5. west, and latitude
                    38. 55. north. It is separated from Washington by a small river called Rock
                    Creek, over which are two bridges. Considerable trade is carried on here; but in
                    consequence of the difficulties of navigation, occasioned by a bar three miles
                    below the town, a great part of the produce is conveyed to Alexandria, and
                    exported from that place. Georgetown contains a market-house, a college, a
                    Lancasterian school, a public library, four banks, and several places of public
                    worship. Georgetown College is a Roman Catholic institution, under the direction
                    of the Catholic clergy of Maryland. It has two spacious edifices, containing a
                    library of 7000 volumes, and has an average number of 150 students.</p>
                <p part="N">Alexandria, an incorporated city on the western bank of the river, is a
                    place of extensive business, and of fashionable resort during the sittings of
                    congress. The streets are regular, and intersect each other at right angles.
                    This city contains a number of public buildings, and eight places of worship.
                    Amongst the valuable articles deposited in the Museum, is the robe in which
                    Washington was baptized, and several other relics of the great patriot of the
                    west. In the district of Columbia the Baptists have eighteen churches, the
                    Presbyterians nine churches, the Methodists 1400 members, the Episcopalians five
                    ministers, the Catholics several churches, and the Unitarians one minister.</p>

                    In 1834 there were published in Maryland thirty-five newspapers and other
                    journals, amongst which were several monthly and quarterly periodicals.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1632, Maryland was granted by Charles I. of England to Sir George
                    Calvert, Lord Baltimore, a Roman Catholic, and an eminent statesman; but before
                    the patent was completed, Lord Baltimore died, and the patent, dated 20th June
                    1632, was given to his eldest son Cecilius, who succeeded to his titles, and who
                    for upwards of forty years directed, as proprietor, the affairs of the colony.
                    Leonard Calvert, his brother, was appointed the first governor; and he, together
                    with about two hundred persons, commenced the settlement of the town of St
                    Mary’s in 1634. A free toleration in religious matters was allowed the settlers,
                    and a system of equity and humanity was practised with regard to the Indian
                    tribes. After the colony of Maryland had established its general assembly, even
                    to the time of the revolution, the right of appointing the governor, and of
                    approving or disapproving the acts of the assembly, was retained by the
                    Baltimore family. The constitution of this state was formed in 1776, but it
                    subsequently underwent many alterations. The following is an outline of it as it
                    now exists. The legislative power is vested in a senate consisting of fifteen
                    members, and a house of delegates consisting of eighty members. These two
                    branches united are styled the General Assembly of Maryland. The members of the
                    house of delegates, four from each county, and two from each of the cities of
                    Annapolis and Baltimore, are elected annually by the people; whilst the members
                    of the senate are elected every fifth year, at Annapolis, by electors who are
                    chosen by the people. These electors choose by ballot nine senators from the
                    western and six from the eastern shore. The executive power is vested in a
                    governor, who is elected annually by a joint ballot of both houses of the
                    general assembly. No one can hold the office of governor more than three years
                    successively, nor be eligible as governor until the expiration of four years
                    after he has been out of that office. The governor is assisted by a council »f
                    five members, who are chosen annually in the same manner as the governor. The
                    general assembly meets annually at Annapolis, on the last Monday in December.
                    The council of the governor is elected on the first Tuesday in January; the
                    governor nominates to office, and the council appoints. The constitution grants
                    the right of suffrage to every free white male citizen above twenty-one years of
                    age, who has resided twelve months within the state, and six months in the
                    county, or in the city of Annapolis or Baltimore, next preceding the election at
                    which he appears to vote. 1he chancellor and judges are nominated by the
                    governor and appointed by the council, and they hold their offices during good
                    behaviour. In appointing officers under the state, the governor has the right of
                    nomination, and the council the right of appointment. The governor does not
                    possess the power of a <hi rend="italic">veto</hi> on the acts of the general
                    assembly. <hi rend="smallcaps">r. r. r.</hi></p>
