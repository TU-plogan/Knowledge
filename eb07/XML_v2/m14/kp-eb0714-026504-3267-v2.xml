                        >Martinique</hi></label>, a large island in the West Indies, belonging to
                    France. It is nearly fifty miles in length by about sixteen in breadth, and
                    comprehends an area of 360 square miles. The surface is uneven, and intersected
                    in all parts by steep and rugged rocks. Piton de Corbet, one of the highest, is
                    about 812 feet above the level of the sea. The shape of this calcareous hill
                    resembles a cone, and it is on that account very difficult of access. The palm
                    trees with which it is covered become more lofty and abundant near the summit,
                    and these continually attract the clouds, which occasion noxious damps, and
                    contribute to render it more rugged in appearance, and more dangerous to ascend.
                    There are also two other mountains conspicuous from their elevation, and from
                    these, particularly from the first, descend numerous streams, which irrigate the
                    island. Martinique is better supplied with water, and less exposed to
                    hurricanes, than Guadaloupe, whilst the productions of both islands are nearly
                    the same. Of 75,321 hectares,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    in cocoa, 491 in cotton, 17,191 are pasturage, and 19,997 are woods. The annual
                    production is valued at 21,000,000 francs. In 1824, the island consumed French
                    products to the value of 16,000,000 francs, and exported to the mother country
                    goods to the amount of 18,000,000 francs. The tonnage engaged in this commerce
                    amounted to 33,500 tons. The revenue in 1823 was 4,000,000 francs. These are the
                    latest returns which can be obtained, but the commerce of Martinique has
                    continued nearly the same since the period at which the above estimate was
                    made.</p>
                <p part="N">Port Royal, the capital and seat of the courts of justice, is situated
                    on one of the several bays which indent the island, and possesses one of the
                    safest and most capacious harbours in the West Indies, or even in the world. It
                    is a well-built and pretty place, the streets being in general placed at right
                    angles to each other, with water running on either side of them. The houses are
                    high, and have more of an European appearance than those in our British
                    colonies. It possesses four large and well-furnished booksellers’ shops, with a
                    population of 7000. But the chief trade centres in St Pierre, the largest place
                    in Martinique, or in all French America. Like Port Royal, it is situated in a
                    bay, and possesses a large and excellent harbour. All visitors are liberal in
                    their praise of the beauty of this town. The streets are neat, regular, and
                    cleanly; the houses good, lofty, and substantial, being generally built of
                    stone, and having an European aspect. Some of the streets have an avenue of
                    trees, which overshadow the footpath; and on either side are deep gutters, down
                    which the water flows. There are two churches, both of them good, and tastefully
                    fitted up. There is a pretty large botanic garden, which is in a flourishing and
                    improving state. St Pierre possesses a theatre, which English travellers
                    pronounce the best in the West Indies. It is the most commercial town in the
                    Lesser Antilles, and contains 2080 houses, and a population of 30,000. In 1827
                    the whole island contained 101,865 inhabitants, of whom 9937 were whites, 10,786
                    were free people of colour, and 81,142 were slaves. It has a garrison, and the
                    administration is conducted by a council, at the head of which is the
                    governor.</p>
                <p part="N">Martinique was discovered by the Spaniards in the year 1493. It
                    afterwards came into the possession of France, by which power it was held till
                    about the middle of the eighteenth century, when it fell into the hands of the
                    English. It was subsequently restored to France, but during the wars between the
                    two countries it was twice captured by Britain. At the peace of 1814, however,
                    it was finally ceded to France.</p>
