                <p part="N"><label type="entry">MERCANTILE LAW</label>. Amongst the ancient Romans,
                    trade and manufactures were accounted degrading and dishonourable employments;
                    and what was done in that way was performed by slaves. None who had been
                    employed in trade, or whose father had been a slave, could be chosen into the
                    senate; and no senator, or father of a senator, could by law keep a bark above a
                    certain small burthen, in order no doubt to prevent his engaging in commerce.
                    The canonists likewise despised trade; and at the council of Melfi it was
                    solemnly determined that none could exercise any traffic, nor follow the
                    profession of the law, with a safe conscience.</p>
                <p part="N">These notions, however, were singular, and very different from the
                    policy which has ever prevailed in this country. According to a law of
                    Athelstan, if any merchant made three voyages on his own account beyond the
                    British channel, or narrow seas, he was entitled to the privileges of a Thane;
                    and it is specially provided by Magna Charta, (c. 30), that all merchants,
                    unless publicly prohibited beforehand, shall have safe conduct to depart from,
                    to come into, or to tarry in and go through the realm, for the exercise of
                    merchandise, without any unreasonable imposts, except in time of war; and that
                    if a war breaks out between us and another country, the merchants of that place
                    shall be attached, but in their person only, till the king is informed how our
                    merchants are treated in the land with which we are at war, and if our merchants
                    are secure theirs shall be so too. Upon this Montesquieu remarks with
                    admiration, that the English have made the protection of foreign merchants one
                    of the articles of their national liberty; and also that the English know much
                    better than any other people on earth how to value at the same time these three
                    things, religion, liberty, and commerce. These, indeed, are the common rights of
                    mankind. They are also inseparably connected together; and as liberty is the
                    life of commerce, so commerce is in its turn the parent of many advantages,
                    moral and physical, personal and political. Its protection and encouragement are
                    now, therefore, an established principle of the law of nations.</p>
                <p part="N">Trade and commerce being thus the immediate offspring of natural
                    liberty, the <hi rend="italic">lex</hi><hi rend="italic">mercatoria,</hi> or the
                    law of merchants, is less a branch of this or that system of municipal law, than
                    of the law of nations, or that universal law which reason teaches all men. It
                    is, if one may so call it, an ambulatory system of civil law, not confined to
                    any one place or locality, but attaching to the persons of men in all their
                    commercial transactions throughout the world; the custom of merchants being
                    every where acknowledged, as their persons and property are by the law of
                    nations every where protected.</p>
                <p part="N">Thus, not to enter here at large into all the details of mercantile law,
                    which will be found in other parts of this work, divers sorts of writings used
                    amongst merchants and trading people in commercial transactions, are sustained
                    in our courts, after the example of other states, although not executed with all
                    the formalities of common deeds. Missive letters, <hi rend="italic">in
                        re</hi><hi rend="italic">mercatoria,</hi> are valid although not holograph,
                    and commissions from merchant to merchant, though not signed before witnesses;
                    nor do fitted accounts amongst merchants, in mercantile matters, require the
                    writer’s name or witnesses. But of all obligations, <hi rend="italic">bills of
                        exchange,</hi> which owe their origin to merchants, are the most favoured.
                    The risks and accidents of trade have also caused particular favour to be
                    extended to persons engaged therein, who have fallen into bankruptcy; provision
                    being made by statute for their entire discharge, on their surrendering their
                    effects to their creditors.</p>
                <p part="N">We find also in many parts of Europe merchant courts or judicatories
                    vested in merchants chosen for that purpose to decide and determine in a summary
                    way their peculiar differences. Of this sort are the guildry courts of the
                    Scottish burghs, which are particularly approved of by statute, 1593, c. 184, as
                    a speedy method of determining all questions between merchant and merchant, and
                    between merchant and mariner, and are declared to have “full strength, force,
                    and effect, according to the lovable form of judgment used in all gude towns of
                    France and Flanders, where burses’ are erected, and specially in Paris, Roan,
                    Bourdeaux, and Rochelle.” Particular attention, indeed, seems to have been paid
                    in Scotland in early times, to the regulation of trade. Before the close of the
                    twelfth century, William the Lion granted to the burgesses of Aberdeen, and the
                    burgesses of Moray, and all his burgesses dwelling north of <pb break="no"

                    Grampians, the privilege of a free <hi rend="italic">hanse,</hi> or mercantile

                    In the southern part of the kingdom"the court of four burghs had met annually
                    from a remote time; but iri addition to this, deputies from the royal burghs
                    south of the Spey were in 1405 appointed to meet in convention with the court of
                    four burghs, to treat, ordain, and determine in all things concerning the
                    utility of the commonweal of the burghs, their liberties and court. The
                    disadvantage, however, of two contemporary assemblies in a country so limited in
                    extent as Scotland, which had also now become a consolidated kingdom, with one
                    common interest, appears to have been quickly felt; for by statute 1487, c. 111,
                    deputies from all the royal burghs, “baith south and north,” were appointed to
                    meet in convention, not with the court of four burghs, as before, but by
                    themselves, yearly, to commune and treat upon the welfare of merchandise, the
                    good rule and statutes for the common profit of the burghs, and to provide
                    remedy for all skaith and injury sustained within burghs. Since this enactment,
                    the burghal parliament, or convention of burghs, has continued to our own
                    time.</p>
