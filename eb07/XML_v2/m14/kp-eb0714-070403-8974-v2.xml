                    signified the passage or transmigration of the soul of a man after death into
                    the body of some other animal. Pythagoras and his followers held, that after
                    death men’s souls passed into other bodies of different kinds, according to the
                    manner of life which they had led. If they had been <pb break="no"

                    they were imprisoned in the bodies of miserable beasts, there to do penance for
                    several ages, at the expiration of which they returned again to animate human
                    forms. But if they lived virtuously, the body of some happier brute, or even of
                    a human creature, was destined to be their new habitation. What led Pythagoras
                    into this opinion was, the persuasion which he had that the soul was not of a
                    perishable nature, and from which he concluded that it must remove into some
                    other body upon its abandoning its actual habitation. Lucan treats this doctrine
                    as a kind of officious lie, contrived to mitigate the apprehension of death, by
                    persuading men that they had changed their lodging, and only ceased to live in
                    order to begin a new life. Reuchlin denies this doctrine, and maintains that the
                    metempsychosis of Pythagoras implied nothing more than a similitude of manners,
                    desires, and studies, which formerly existed in some person deceased, and were
                    subsequently revived in another. Thus, when it was said that Euphorbus was
                    revived in Pythagoras, no more was meant than that the martial virtue which had
                    shone in Euphorbus at the time of the Trojan war, was now in some measure
                    revived in Pythagoras, by reason of the great respect he bore to the <hi
                        rend="italic">athletae.</hi> For those people, wondering how a philosopher
                    should be so much taken with men of the sword, he palliated the matter by saying
                    that the soul of Euphorbus, meaning thereby his genius, disposition, and
                    inclinations, were revived in him; and this gave occasion to the report that the
                    soul of Euphorbus, who perished in the Trojan war, had transmigrated into
                    Pythagoras. Ficin us asserts that what Plato said of the migration of a human
                    soul into a brute, is allegorically said, and to be understood, only of those
                    manners, affections, and habits which have degenerated into a beastly nature by
                    viee. Serranus, though he allows some force to this interpretation, yet rather
                    inclines to understand the metempsychosis as meaning a resurrection. Pythagoras
                    is said to have borrowed the notion of a metempsychosis from the Egyptians; but
                    others maintain that he received it from the ancient Brahmins. It is still
                    retained amongst the Banians and other idolaters of India and China, and forms
                    the principal foundation of their religion; indeed, so bigoted are they to this
                    tenet, that they not only forbear eating any thing which has life, but many of
                    them even refuse to defend themselves against wild beasts. They burn no wood,
                    lest some little animalcule should be consumed in it; and are so very
                    charitable, that they will redeem from the hands of strangers any animals which
                    they find ready to be killed.</p>
