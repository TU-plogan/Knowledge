                            Andrew</hi></label>, a well-known practical astronomer and geographer,
                    was born at Laon, on the 16th April 1744. His father was an architect, and
                    educated him with the intention of making him his successor in his business. He
                    afterwards took charge of two young men at Sens, as their private tutor, and
                    accidentally became acquainted with Lalande, under whose patronage he was
                    subsequently brought forward as an observer, surveyor, and computer. He made two
                    voyages with Μ. de la Bretonniére, and assisted him in surveying some parts of
                    the coast of France. He was afterwards employed in various computations by the
                    Marquis de Chabert, and the Duc D’Ayen. Having obtained a prize from the Academy
                    of Sciences in 1782, for a <hi rend="italic">Memoir on Comets,</hi> he became a
                    member of the Academy the same year. About the year 1785, he undertook the
                    publication of the <hi rend="italic">Connaissance</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                        Terns,</hi> and continued it till he was employed in geodetical operations
                    at a distance from Paris. He was appointed member of a committee, along with
                    Cassini, de Thury, and Legendre, to meet the English astronomers for the
                    determination of the relative situation of the observatories, which had been
                    proposed by Cassini. It was in these operations that he first brought Borda’s
                    circle into general use. In 1791 he was appointed, in conjunction with Delambre,
                    to execute the intentions of the Constituent Assembly, with regard to the
                    determination of a basis of linear measures. A variety of delays and
                    difficulties occurred in these operations. In Spain he was wounded in the head
                    and side, by an accident which occurred whilst he was inspecting a water-wheel;
                    and the political circumstances of the times produced many embarrassments, which
                    caused him to linger in Italy perhaps a little longer than was actually
                    necessary; but the establishment of the <hi rend="italic">Bureau des
                        Longitudes,</hi> and his nomination as a member of it, determined his
                    immediate return to Paris. He was now director of the Observatory, and he
                    entered with great zeal on a series of observations, which were to rival those
                    of Flamsteed, of Bradley, and of Maskelyne; but he seems to have been a little
                    tired of the confinement, and he readily accepted, or rather solicited, the
                    appointment to assist in the measurements required for the still farther
                    extension of the arc of the meridian to the south of Barcelona. But the secret
                    motive for his seeking this humbler employment appears to have been a desire to
                    remove some doubts which he entertained respecting the latitude of Barcelona, as
                    it appeared after his death from his papers, that there had been a discordance
                    of 3' ’ in some observations which he had not made public. In this unfortunate
                    undertaking, he paid a heavy penalty for any want of candour which may have been
                    attributed to the concealment. Shipwreck and disease awaited him; and he died at
                    last, on the 20th of September 1805, of a fever, which fatigue and a bad climate
                    had brought on. From the time of his accident in Spain he had become habitually
                    melancholy and timid, though regardless of personal danger in the pursuit of his
                    professional objects. His whole time was occupied in observing and calculating;
                    he published little; and never ventured to advance any reflections on the
                    subjects which employed him, being probably more in the habit of acting than of
                    speculating. He married, in 1777, Mademoiselle Thérèse Maιjon, with whom he had
                    become acquainted at Versailles. This connexion was in every respect happy; he
                    was indebted to it for a competent fortune, and he left a daughter and two
                    sons.</p>
