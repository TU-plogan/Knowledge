                        >Miquinez</hi></label>, the northern capital of the empire of Morocco,
                    stands at the extremity of the province of Beni'Hassan, eighty leagues north
                    from the city of Morocco (.which is the southern imperial city), and twenty to
                    the east of Sallee and the ocean. Maknassa, its founder, built it first at the
                    bottom of a valley; but Muley Ismael extended it considerably over the plain
                    which lies to the west of the valley. It is surrounded with well cultivated
                    fields and hills, adorned with gardens and olive plantations, and abundantly
                    watered with rivulets. The fruitfulness of the soil, and the temperature of the
                    climate, seem to produce even a superior urbanity in the inhabitants. ’ The
                    winter, indeed, is very inconvenient, on account of the dirtiness of the town,
                    the streets not being paved, and the soil being slimy. Mequinez is surrounded
                    with walls; and the palace is fortified with two bastions, on which some small
                    guns were formerly mounted. In this city Muley Ismael and Muley Abdallah often
                    resisted the efforts of the Brebers,the sworn enemies of their tyranny. To the
                    west are seen some walls of circumvallation, six feet in height, which were
                    probably mere in trenchmen ts for the infantry, the attacks of the <pb

                    />Brebers being only sudden and momentary inroads, which did not require a long
                    defence. The houses are neater than those of Morocco, and here, as at Morocco,
                    there is a walled and guarded suburb for the Jews, who are more numerous, and
                    can turn their industry to greater account, than those of the northern capital.
                    Near the Jewry there is another inclosed and separate quarter, called the negro
                    town. It was built by Muley Ismael, for the accommodation of those black
                    families which composed his soldiery, but it is now uninhabited.</p>
                <p part="N">At the south-east extremity of the city stands the palace of the
                    emperor, which was built by Muley Ismael. The space occupied by this palace is
                    very great; it includes several gardens, elegantly disposed, and well watered.
                    There is a large garden in the centre, surrounded by a vast and pretty regular
                    gallery resting on columns, which communicates with the apartments. Those of the
                    women are very spacious, and have a communication with a large chamber which
                    looks into the garden. As you pass from one apartment to another, you find at
                    intervals regular courts paved with square pieces of black and white marble; in
                    the middle of these courts is a marble basin, from the centre of which rises <hi
                        rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">jet dean,</hi> and the waterfalls down
                    into this basin. These fountains are numerous in the palace; they are useful for
                    domestic purposes, and they serve for the ablutions, which the scruples of the
                    Mahommedans have exceedingly multiplied. The palaces of the Moorish kings are
                    large, because they are composed only of one range of apartments, which are long
                    and narrow, and from eighteen to tw enty feet in height; they have few
                    ornaments, and receive the light by two large folding doors, which are opened
                    more or less, as occasion requires. The rooms are always lighted from a square
                    court in the centre, which is generally encompassed with a colonnade.</p>
                <p part="N">The Moors here are more courteous than those in the southern parts; they
                    are civil to strangers, and invite them into their gardens, which are very neat.
                    The women are beautiful, and have a fair complexion, with fine black eyes, and
                    white teeth. They are sometimes seen taking the air on the terraces; they do not
                    hide themselves from Europeans, but retire very quickly on the appearance of a
                    Moor.</p>
