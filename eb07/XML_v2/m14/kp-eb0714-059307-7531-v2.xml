                <p part="N"><label type="entry">MERIONETHSHIRE</label>, a maritime county of North
                    Wales. It is bounded on the north by Carnarvonshire and Denbighshire, on the
                    east by the latter county and Montgomeryshire, on the south by Cardiganshire,
                    and on the west by the Irish Channel. It is of a triangular shape, contracting
                    towards the south. Its length from north to south is thirty-six, and its
                    greatest breadth thirty-four miles. Its area is estimated at 691 miles.</p>
                <p part="N">There are few parts of the British Islands in which the scenery is more
                    varied, the surface more irregular, or the prospects more romantic. Many of the
                    peaks of the lofty mountains are near to each other, with deep valleys, or
                    rather chasms between; and in other parts, the variety of objects forming
                    striking contrasts with the vicinity of the sea, give a most picturesque
                    collection of pleasing, though sometimes terrific views. The principal
                    mountains, and their heights above the level of the sea, are Cader Idris, 2914
                    feet, Arran Fowdy, 2955 feet, Arrening, 2809 feet, Cader Ferwyn, 2563 feet, and
                    Pengam, 1510 feet. These mountains consist principally of granite, porphyry, and
                    other unstratified rocks, whilst the secondary hills are composed of different
                    kinds of schistus.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal rivers are the Dee, which runs through this county, and
                    after passing the beautiful town of Corwin, enters Denbighshire; the Maw or
                    Mawddach, which rises in the middle of the county, and empties itself into the
                    Irish Channel; the Dovy, which rises near a pass in the mountains leading to
                    Montgomeryshire, and forming at last a large estuary, enters the sea at
                    Aberdovy; and the Gleslyn and Dwyrid, which unite their streams before entering
                    the ocean. These rivers receive the waters of numerous brooks and rivulets which
                    trickle from the mountains, and in their course fertilise the valleys through
                    which they run. There are several lakes, of which the most considerable for
                    extent, as well as for beauty, is Llyn Tegid, near Bala, sometimes called
                    Pimblemere. It is about four miles in length, and <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194207544?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7544-0594"/>three
                    quarters of a mile in breadth; and its banks are most beautifully adorned with
                    slopes, partly covered with woods, and partly exhibiting verdant pastures. Lynn
                    Talyllin, at the foot of Cader Idris, is less extensive, but scarcely less
                    beautiful. Some fine cataracts add their beauty to the other romantic scenery of
                    this county; of these Rhaidr Dhu and the fall of the Glyn near Port Lyn Dyffws
                    are the most remarkable; but several smaller ones will reward the labour of the
                    traveller who delights in the picturesque.</p>
                <p part="N">The agriculture of the county is in a very imperfect state, though the
                    spirited exertions of some large proprietors have recently exhibited specimens
                    of great improvement. Nearly three-fourths Of the county is nninclosed, and much
                    even of that part is unproductive waste. Large portions of the marsh lands on
                    the coast have, by inclosing, embanking, and draining, been converted into rich
                    pasture, and much more requires only the application of capital to bring it into
                    the same state. Very little of the land is adapted to the plough, and the
                    principal pursuit of the farmers is breeding and rearing cattle. The heifers
                    from this eounty are sent in droves to the fairs in the south of England, and
                    when improved by good pasture, are found very valuable beasts. The sheep are of
                    small size, the flesh of them being highly prized, and their wool forms the
                    material for the domestic manufactures.</p>
                <p part="N">There are scarcely any manufactures that can be noticed, excepting a few
                    coarse woollens; the females of all the families, however, employ themselves in
                    knitting hosiery goods from the native wool. These furnish considerable
                    quantities of the caps called Welsh wigs; and gloves, and stockings, the only
                    goods that are sent out of the county, and the annual value of which is
                    estimated at £25,000. The only trade is from the harbour of Barmouth, situated
                    on a small arm of the sea, into which several rivulets empty themselves. The
                    port is difficult of entrance, and but little frequented. It is chiefly devoted
                    to the coasting trade; exporting oats, barley, butter, cheese, oak-bark, and
                    timber, and importing coals, culm, and groceries. On account of the excellence
                    of the beach, and the romantic beauties of the surrounding country, it has been
                    much frequented of late years for sea-bathing.</p>
                <p part="N">The number of the inhabitants at the several decennial enumerations has
                    been found to stand thus: in 1801, 27,500; in 1811, 30,924; in 1821,34,362;
                    andin 1831, 35,315. At this last period the males were 17,194, and the females
                    18,121. In the year 1830 the baptisms were of males 254, and of females 284,
                    being a total of 538. The burials of the same year were of males 275 and of
                    females 277, being a total of552. The marriages were 255. The illegitimate
                    births were of males, eight, and of females thirteen. The families were 7358, of
                    whom 3583 were chiefly employed in agriculture, 1815 in trade, manufactures and
                    handicraft, and 1960 were not comprehended in either of the preceding classes.
                    The males twenty years of age were 8879∙ The occupiers of land employing
                    labourers were 1112 and those not employing labourers were 1246. The labourers
                    were 2601. The persons employed in manufactures or in making manufacturing
                    machinery were 194; those engaged in retail trade or in handicraft as masters or
                    workmen were 1761; the capitalists, bankers, professional, or other educated
                    persons, were 146; and the labourers employed in other than agricultural labour
                    were 738, and the other males twenty years of age were 998. The male servants
                    were 131, and the female 2222. The annual value of the real property of the
                    county, as assessed for the purpose of the income tax in 1815, was £111,436.</p>
                <p part="N">The towns of most consideration are Dolgelly, where the assizes are held
                    with 4087 inhabitants; Llanghill, with 2359; Corwen, with 1980; and Festeniog,
                    with 1648. The most remarkable seats are those of Sir Robert Williams Vaughan,
                    at Nannau; of Mr. Oakley, at Tany Bwlch Hall;</p>
                <p part="N">Sir Thomas Mostyns, at Cors y Gedel, and Mr. Corbet at Ynysymaengwyn.
                    One member is returned to parliament for the county.</p>
