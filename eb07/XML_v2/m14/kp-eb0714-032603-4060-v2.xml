                    was the son of a clergyman, and was originally intended for the church; but, in
                    consequence of some mortifications his father met with from the synod on account
                    of the peculiar sentiments he entertained respecting the doctrine of the
                    Trinity, he turned his thoughts to physic. Maty took his degree of doctor of
                    physic at Leyden, and in 1740 came to settle in England, his father having
                    determined to quit Holland for ever. In order to make himself known, he began in

                    continues to hold its rank amongst the best of those which have appeared since
                    the time of Bayle, answered the end he had intended by it, and introduced him to
                    the acquaintance of some of the most respectable literary characters of the
                    country he had made his own. It was to their active and uninterrupted friendship
                    that he owed the places he afterwards possessed. In 1758 he was chosen fellow,
                    and in 1765, on the resignation of Dr Birch, who died a few months afterwards,
                    and had made him his executor, secretary to the Royal Society. He had been
                    appointed one of the under librarians of the British Museum at its first
                    institution in 1753, and became principal librarian on the death of Dr Knight in
                    1772. Useful in all these situations, he promised to be eminently so in the
                    last, when he was seized with a languishing disorder, which in 1776 put an end
                    to a life that had been uniformly devoted to the pursuits of science and the
                    offices of humanity. He was an early and an active advocate for inoculation; and
                    when there was a doubt entertained that one might have the small-pox this way a
                    second time, he tried it upon himself unknown to his family. He was a member of
                    the medical club (along with Drs Parsons, Templeman, Fothergill, Watson, and
                    others) which met every fortnight in St Paul’s Churchyard. He was twice married,
                    and left a son and three daughters. He had nearly finished the Memoirs of the
                    Earl of Chesterfield, which were completed by his son-in-law, Mr Justamond, and
                    prefixed to that nobleman’s Miscellaneous Works, 1777, in two vols. 4to.</p>

                    son of the former, was born in 1745, and educated at Westminster, and at Trinity
                    College, Cambridge, the travelling fellowship of which he held for three years.
                    He was subsequently chaplain to Lord Stormont at Paris, and soon afterwards
                    vacated his next fellowship by marrying one of the three daughters of Joseph
                    Clerk, and sister of Captain Charles Clerk, who succeeded to the command on the
                    death of Captain Cook. On his father’s death in 1776, he was appointed to the
                    office of one of the under librarians of the British Museum, and was afterwards
                    preferred to a superior department, having the care of the antiquities, for
                    which he was eminently qualified. In 1776 he succeeded his father in the office
                    of secretary to the Royal Society. In the disputes respecting the reinstatement
                    of Dr Hutton in the department of secretary for foreign correspondence in 1784,
                    Mr Maty took a warm and distinguished part, and resigned the office of
                    secretary; after which he undertook to assist gentlemen or ladies in perfecting
                    their knowledge of the Greek, Latin, French, and Italian classics. Mi-Maty was a
                    judicious and conscientious man; and having conceived some doubts about the
                    articles he had subscribed in early life, he never could be prevailed upon to
                    place himself in the way of ecclesiastical preferment, though his connexions
                    were amongst those who could have served him essentially in this point; and soon
                    after his father’s death he withdrew himself from ministering in the established
                    church, his reasons for which he published in the forty-seventh volume of the
                    Gentleman’s Magazine (p. 466). His whole life was thenceforward devoted to
                    literary pursuits. He received L.100 from the Duke of Marlborough, with a copy
                    of that beautiful work, the <hi rend="italic">Gemmce Marlhurienses, of</hi>
                    which only a hundred copies were worked off for presents, and of which Mr Maty
                    wrote the French account, as Mr Bryant did the Latin. In January 1782 he set on
                    foot a review of publications, principally foreign, which he carried on, with
                    great credit to himself and satisfaction to the public, for nearly five years,
                    when he was obliged to discontinue it on account of ill health. He had long
                    laboured under an asthmatic complaint, which at times made great ravages in his
                    constitution, and at last put a period to his life in January 1787, at the age
                    of forty-two, leaving behind him one son.</p>
