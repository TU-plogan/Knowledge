                    >Michael</hi></label>, an eminent classical editor, of a foreign family, was
                    born in 1668. He was educated at Westminster school, where Dr Busby kept him to
                    the study of Greek and Latin some years longer than usual. He then gained
                    another powerful friend in Dr South, canon of Christ Church, who made him a
                    student of that house, where he took the degree of master of arts early in 1696.
                    From' 1695 till 1699, he was second master of Westminster school, which· was
                    afterwards indebted to him for Graecae Linguae Dialecti, in usum Scholae
                    Westmonastericnsis, 1706, 8vo, and also for the English Grammar, applied to, and
                    exemplified in, the English Tongue, 1712, 8vo. In 1711, he published Remarks on
                    Whiston’s Account of the proceedings of Convocation relative to himself, in a
                    Letter to the Bishop of Bath and Wells, 8vo; and also an Essay against Arianism,
                    and some other Heresies, in reply to Whiston’s historical Preface and Appendix
                    to his Primitive Christianity Revived, 8vo. In 1709 he gave the first specimen
                    of his skill in typographical antiquities, by publishing Stephanorum Historia,
                    vitas ipsorum ac libros complectens, 8vo. This was followed in 1717 by Historia
                    Typographorum aliquot Parisiensium, vitas et libros complectens, 8vo; and in

                    and continued to the year 1536, was published at the Hague in 1702, prefaced by
                    a letter of Toland, under the title of Conjectura verisimilis de prima
                    Typography Inventione; the third volume, in two parts, continued to 1557, and
                    (by an appendix) to 1664, issued from the same press in 1725; and in 1733 was
                    published at Amsterdam what was usually considered as the fourth volume, under
                    the title of Annales Typographici ab artis inventae origine, ad annum <hi

                    complectens, divided, like the two preceding volumes, into two parts. In the
                    intermediate years, Mr Maittaire was diligently employed on various works of
                    importance. In 1713 he published by subscription Opera et Fragmenta Veterum
                    Poetarum, 1713, in two volumes in folio; but the title of some copies is dated
                    1721. In 1714, he edited a Greek Testament, in two volumes. The Latin writers,
                    which he published separately, most of them with good indexes, came out in the
                    following order: In 1713, Christus Patiens, Justin, Lucretius. Phaedrus,
                    Sallust, Terence; in 1715, Catullus, Tibullus, Propertius, Cornelius Nepos,
                    Florus, Horace, Juvenal, Ovid in three vols., and Virgil; in 1711, Caesar’s
                    Commentaries, Martial, and Quintus Curtius; in 1718 and 1725, Velleius
                    Paterculus; in 1719, Lucan; and in 1720, Bonefonii Carmina. In 1721, he
                    published, Batrachomyomachia, Graece, ad veterum exemplarium fidem recusa;
                    glossa Graeca, variantibus lectionibus, versionibus Latinis, commentariis et
                    indicibus, illustrata, 8vo; and in 1722, Miscellanea Graecorum aliquot
                    Scriptorum Carmina, cum versione Latina et notis, in 4to. In 1724 he compiled,
                    at the request of Dr John Freind, an index to the works of Aretaeus, intended to
                    accompany the folio edition of that author published in 1723. In 1725 he
                    published an edition of Anacreon in 4to, of which only a hundred copies were
                    printed, and the few errata in each copy corrected by his own hand. In 1726 he
                    published Petri Petiti Medici Parisiensis in tres priores Aretaei Cappadocis
                    Libros Commentarii, nunc primum editi, in 4to. This learned commentary was found
                    amongst the papers of Graevius. From 1728 to 1733 he was employed in publishing
                    Marmorum Arundelianorum, Seldenianorum, aliorumque Academiae Oxoni-ensi
                    donatorum, una cum Commentariis et Indice, editio secunda, folio, to which an
                    appendix was printed in 1733; <pb break="no" facs="nls:194200433?mode=fullsize"

                    Maizeaux, in qua Indices in Annales Typographicos methodus explicatur, printed
                    in the Present State of the Republic of Letters, for 1733 (p. 142). The life of
                    Robert Stephens in Latin, revised and corrected by the author, with a new and
                    complete list of his works, is prefixed to the improved edition of Stephens’s
                    Thesaurus, 4 vols, in folio, which appeared in 1734. In 1736 was published
                    Antiquae Inscriptiones duae, folio, being a commentary on two large copper
                    tables discovered near Heraclea, in the bay of Tarentum. In the year 1738 were
                    printed at the Hague, Graecae Ling'uae Dialeeti in Scholae Rcgiae
                    Westmonasteriensis usum recogniti, opera Mich. Maittaire. In 1739 he addressed
                    to the empress of Russia a small Latin poem, under the title of Carmen
                    Epi-cinium Augustissimae Russorum Imperatrici sacrum. He was also editor of
                    Plutarch’s Apophthegmata, 1641, in 4to. The last publication of Maittaire was a
                    volume of poems in 4to, 1742, under the title of Senilia, sive Poetica aliquot
                    in argumentis varii generis Tentamina. Mr Maittaire died in 1747, aged
                    seventy-nine. His valuable library, which had been fifty years collecting, was
                    sold by auction at the close of the same year and the beginning of the
                    following, taking up in all forty-four nights. Mr Maittaire was patronized by
                    the first Earl of Oxford, both before and after that gentleman’s elevation to
                    the peerage, and he continued to be a favourite with his son the second earl; he
                    was also Latin tutor to Mr Stanhope, the Earl of Chesterfield’s favourite
                    son.</p>
