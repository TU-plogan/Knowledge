                <p part="N"><label type="entry">MARACAYBO</label>, a province of South America, in
                    what was till 1835 the republic of Colombia, but which is now separated into
                    three independent states. Maracaybo is bounded on the west by Rio Hacha, on the
                    east by Venezuela, on the south by Pamplona, and on the north by the Carribean
                    Sea. Maracaybo may be described as a considerable tract of country surrounding a
                    vast sheet of water of the same name. The lake of Maracaybo is a little
                    Mediterranean, communicating with a gulf called after it, by a channel about two
                    leagues in breadth by eight in length. Depons describes the lake and gulf as
                    nearly of the form of a decanter, extending from south to north, the neck of
                    which communicates with the sea. It is about fifty leagues in length from the
                    bar to its most southern recess, its greatest breadth is about thirty leagues,
                    and its circumference upwards of one hundred and fifty leagues. Its waters are
                    sweet, unless the wind blows with violence from the sea, when salt water is
                    forced into it, thus communicating to them a brackish property. The lake,
                    however, is not subject to tempests; but occasionally the north wind produces a
                    short and broken swell. It is navigated with ease, and has depth of water
                    sufficient for the largest vessels. All goods intended for consumption or export
                    at Maracaybo are conveyed by the rivers which discharge themselves into the
                    lake. Of these there are above twenty, the most considerable being Sulia or
                    Pamplona River, the Motatan, Chama, Catumbo, Cuernos, To-rondoy, and Perija. All
                    the different species of fish found in the rivers of South America (Depons
                    says), abound in this lake; but the tortoise is not found here. There are <hi
                        rend="italic">monatis</hi> or sea-cows of enormous size. On one of the
                    shores of the lake there is an inexhaustible mine of mineral pitch. The
                    bituminous vapours which it exhales are so inflammable, that during the night
                    phosphoric fires are continually seen, which in their effect resemble lightning.
                    They go by the name of the “Lantern of Maracaybo,” because they serve for a
                    lighthouse and compass to both the Spaniards and the Indians, who without the
                    assistance of either navigate the lake. There are still several barbarous tribes
                    of Indians in its vicinity, but, from the sterility of the soil on the borders
                    of the lake, and the insalubrity of the atmosphere, they formerly preferred
                    fixing their abodes on the lake itself. These huts erected on the water amounted
                    to a number of villages, but they were all destroyed by the Spaniards, with the
                    exception of four. The inhabitants have a church, under the care of a curate;
                    and they derive their chief subsistence from fishing and hunting wild ducks. The
                    soil on the western shores of the lake is good, and this induced some Spaniards,
                    regardless of the insalubrity of the climate, to fix their residence there, for
                    the purpose of raising cocoa and provisions. The settlement, however, consists
                    only of a few scattered habitations. The southern extremity of the lake is
                    uncultivated, and destitute of inhabitants. The temperature of the whole
                    province is very high; that of the northern <pb break="no"

                    less so than the others, but it is incomparably healthier.</p>

                    leagues from the sea, was founded in 1571. It stands in the midst of a sandy
                    plain, without any stratum of vegetable earth, in latitude 10. 30. north, and
                    longitude 74. 6. west of Paris. The climate is intensely hot, and during July
                    and August almost insupportable; yet it is accounted healthy, because no endemic
                    complaints prevail. Violent storms are frequent, accompanied with thunder and
                    lightning, and occasionally prove very destructive. Most of the houses are
                    covered with reeds, but the town is fortified. The parish church is large and
                    handsome, and there are four monasteries, a convent, and an hospital. For
                    upwards of twenty leagues towards the <hi rend="italic">serrania</hi> (or
                    mountain ridge) there is no other water for even the cattle, but rain water,
                    which is preserved in tanks. Depons draws a favourable picture in some respects
                    of the character of the inhabitants. From the habit which they contract in
                    infancy of sailing on the lake, they imbibe at a very early period a taste for
                    navigation; and this leads many of them to repair to the seaports to obtain
                    employment, “Those who resist the attractions of the sea,” says that traveller,
                    “raise herds of cattle, or take care of those of their fathers. Nothing better
                    evinces their aptitude for this species of occupation, than the immense number
                    of beasts with which the savannas of Maracaybo are covered. The principal ones
                    are those of Jobo, Ancon, Palmares, and Cannades. I ought to mention, that there
                    is more merit in raising cattle in the savannas of Maracaybo than in any other
                    place in these provinces; because, having neither rivers nor ponds that never
                    dry up, drought occasions the death of many, in spite of the precautions they
                    take, in cases of this sort, to drive them towards those parts where they can
                    with convenience water them.” Education is in a very low state amongst the
                    people, yet they show a partiality for, and from their natural talents make no
                    inconsiderable progress in literature. Notwithstanding their activity, courage,
                    and talent, the inhabitants of Maracaybo are reproached with a want of regard
                    for their word, and a habit of thinking themselves not bound by their signature,
                    until after they have in vain endeavoured to release themselves from it by law.
                    Depons places the character of the women very high. Maracaybo contains many
                    descendants of the early conquerors, who now live in a state of affluence.
                    Others of the inhabitants gain wealth by traffic, and the whole are supposed to
                    exceed 20,000 in number. The slaves are said not to exceed 5000; and the freed
                    blacks, by whom the trades are carried on, are but few. Depons estimates the
                    entire population of the province at 100,000.</p>
