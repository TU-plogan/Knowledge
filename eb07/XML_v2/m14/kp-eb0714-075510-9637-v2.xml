                    one of the most laborious of antiquaries, was born in the year 1579, at Losdun,
                    a town near the Hague. It appears that the name of his family was <hi
                        rend="italic">De Meurs,</hi> which he latinized, according to the usage of
                    the learned of his time. His father, a regular canon of the house of the Twelve
                    Apostles at Utrecht, having embraced the reform of Calvin, took refuge in 1569
                    at the Hague, and some time afterwards obtained the pastoral charge of Losdun.
                    He taught his son the principles of the Latin language, and then sent him to
                    study at Leyden, where he made so rapid progress, that, at the age of twelve, he
                    composed harangues in Latin, and, at thirteen, verses in Greek. His taste led
                    him to cultivate philology; he particularly directed his attention to Lycophron,
                    the most obscure of all the Greek authors, whom he undertook to illustrate; and,
                    at the age of sixteen, he completed bis commentary on that difficult writer, a
                    work which astonished the greatest scholars and critics of the time. When he had
                    finished his course of study, the grand pensionary Barneveld confided to him the
                    education of his sons; and he was also appointed to accompany them to the
                    different courts of Europe. He turned his travels to account, by availing
                    himself of the opportunities which they afforded for extending his knowledge;
                    and, in passing through Orleans in 1608, he was admitted doctor of Jaws. On his
                    return to Holland, he was, in 1610, appointed professor of history in the
                    academy of Leyden; and the following year he was promoted to the chair of Greek,
                    which he filled with great distinction. The states of Holland conferred on him
                    the title of historiographer to their high mightinesses, and honoured him with
                    other marks of their esteem; but after the execution of the unfortunate
                    Barneveld in 1619, the persecution soon extended itself to all who had been in
                    any degree connected with him; and Meursius, the most gentle of human beings,
                    who, from his habits, was an entire stranger to the disputes which then agitated
                    his unfortunate country, did not escape molestation. As his simple and retired
                    life did not afford his enemies any pretext for accusing him, they attempted to
                    drive him from his professorship by insults, which were daily repeated, even in
                    the apartment where he delivered his prelections; they reproached him with
                    writing too many books, and alleged that, in consequence, the university did not
                    reap any benefit from his studies. The interests of his family, which depended
                    entirely on the emoluments of his office, forced him to submit in silence to
                    these affronts; but the king <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Denmark having, in 1625,
                    offered him the chair of history in the university of Sora, together with the
                    place of historiographer, he at once accepted the situation, and fully justified
                    the high opinion which foreigners had conceived of his talents. The remainder of
                    his life was divided between his official duties and literary pursuits; and he
                    died of the stone, on the 20th of September 1639, at the age of sixty. He was
                    buried in the principal church of Sora, in a tomb adorned with an epitaph, which
                    may be found in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Belgica</hi> of Foppens, and also in the work of Niceron.</p>
                <p part="N">Meursius rendered an unappreciable service to letters by the numerous
                    editions which he published of the Greek authors, with corrections, critical
                    remarks, and Latin versions. The principal works which he edited are, the Poems
                    of Lycophron; the Tactics of the Emperor Leo; the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Opuscula</hi> of IIesychius; the Elements of Music by Aristoxenes; the

                    Dyscoles; and the works of Porphyry, Procopius, Gaza, and others. The works of
                    Meursius were collected by Lami, Florence, 1741-1763, in twelve volumes folio.
                    This collection is rare and much prized. In the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi>

                <p part="N">The memory of Meursius has suffered by his being sometimes represented
                    as the author of the infamous dialogues <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi

                    production of one Chorier, an advocate of Grenoble, who probably prefixed to it
                    the name of Meursius for the purpose of throwing ridicule on the grave and
                    learned professor. His son John was a scholar of considerable eminence, and
                    produced some works evincing erudition and research. <hi rend="smallcaps"
