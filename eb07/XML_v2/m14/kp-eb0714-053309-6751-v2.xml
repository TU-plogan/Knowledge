                    the preceding, was born at Lubeck in 1638. After acquiring the elements of
                    literature in his native place, he went, in 1655, to the university of
                    Helmstadt, where he applied himself to philosophy and medicine, and afterwards
                    studied at Groningen, Franeker, and Leyden. On his return to Germany, he
                    undertook a tour through Italy, France, and England; contracted an acquaintance
                    with the learned wherever he went; and took his degree in physic as he passed
                    through Angers, in 1663. In 1664, he obtained a professorship of physic at
                    Helmstadt, to which, in 1678, were joined the professorships of history and
                    poetry, which he held until the time of his death, in March 1700. Besides a
                    number of works relating to his own profession, he published <hi rend="italic"
                        >Scriptores Rerum Germanicarum,</hi> 1688, in three vols, folio; an useful
                    collection which had been commenced but not completed by his father.</p>

                    learned man of the same family as the two preceding, was born in 1611. He early
                    devoted himself to literature and criticism, particularly the learning of the
                    ancients, and became eminently skilled in archaeology. In 1652he published a
                    collection of seven Greek authors, who had written upon music, to which he added
                    a Latin version by himself. It was entitled <hi rend="italic">Antiquae
                        Musicae</hi><hi rend="italic">Auctores Septem</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Graece</hi><hi rend="italic">et Patine,</hi><hi rend="italic">Marcus

                    forms the most celebrated of all his critical works. From these commentaries on
                    the Greek musical writers, particularly Alypius, we can almost decipher the
                    characters used by the Greeks in their musical notation; characters which,
                    before the time of Meibomius, had been so altered, corrupted, and disfigured, by
                    the ignorance or negligence of the transcribers of ancient manuscripts, that
                    they had become nearly, if not altogether, unintelligible. The Queen of Sweden,
                    to whom this publication was dedicated, invited Meibomius to her court; but his
                    stay there was abridged by an occurrente equally ridiculous and extraordinary.
                    He became the victim of one of those malicious tricks called practical jokes.
                    The queen having imbibed somewhat of his enthusiasm in favour of the music of
                    the ancients, was easily persuaded by Bourdelot, a physician in attendance on
                    her person, to desire Meibomius to sing an ancient Grecian air, whilst an old
                    Frenchman, named Naudet, should dance <hi rend="italic">a la Grec</hi> to the
                    sound of his voice. Meibomius of course complied with the royal request; but the
                    performance, instead of exciting admiration, produced loud bursts of laughter,
                    in which her majesty heartily joined. Meibomius, enraged beyond measure at this
                    reception, chanced to espy Bourdelot in the gallery amongst the scoffers, and
                    having no doubt that it was he who had maliciously instigated the queen to
                    desire this performance, immediately flew thither, and unrestrained by the
                    presence of her majesty, floored the luckless physician by a terrible facer,
                    delivered with all the energy of passion. In consequence of this summary
                    proceeding, the expounder of ancient music found it necessary to quit Sweden
                    without the ceremony of asking leave, or waiting to be called to account <pb

                    />for his conduct. He went to Copenhagen, where he was well received, and soon
                    afterwards appointed professor in a college instituted for the instruction of
                    the young Danish nobility. He was also honoured with the title of aulic
                    counsellor, and advanced tö the dignity of president of the board of maritime
                    customs at Elsinore; but having neglected his duty, he was dismissed from his
                    office, and obliged to quit Denmark in disgrace. He then proceeded to Amsterdam,
                    where he settled, and became professor of history in the college of that place.
                    But his evil fortune still pursued him; for having refused to give instructions
                    to the son of a burgomaster, upon the ground that he was not accustomed to teach
                    boys the elements of knowledge, but to direct the studies of young men advanced
                    in learning, he was deprived of his situation, and forced to quit Amsterdam.
                    Being again thrown upon the world, he visited France and England; after which he
                    returned to Holland, where he led a private and studious life until 1711, when
                    he died, at a very advanced age, having nearly completed a century. Meibomius
                    pretended that the Hebrew Bible was full of errors, and undertook to correct
                    them by means of a metre which he fancied he had discovered in the books of the
                    Old Testament. But the whole scheme was an illusion, and drew upon the author
                    the unsparing ridicule of the learned. Nevertheless, he was a scholar of no mean
                    order, as is proved by his edition of Diogenes Laertius, Amsterdam, 1692, in two
                    vols. 4to.; his <hi rend="italic">Liber de Fabrica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Triremium,</hi> 1671, in which he endeavours to explain how the ancients
                    disposed their bancs of oars; his edition of the ancient Greek Mythologists; and
                    his <hi rend="italic">Dialogues on Proportions,</hi> in which Euclid,
                    Archimedes, Appollonius, Pappus, Eutocius, Theon, and Hermotinus are the
                    interlocutors. <hi rend="smallcaps">( a.)</hi></p>
