                    empire, created, as is said, by Diocletian, and having the inspection and
                    government of all the forces, somewhat like a constable of France. At first
                    there were two of these officers instituted, the one for the infantry and the
                    other for the cavalry; but the two were united into one under Constantine.
                    Afterwards, as their power was increased, so was also their number; and there
                    was one appointed for the court, another for Thrace, a third for the East, and a
                    fourth for Illyria. They were afterwards called <hi rend="italic">comites</hi>
