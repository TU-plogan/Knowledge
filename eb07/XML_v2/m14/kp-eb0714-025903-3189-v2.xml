                    was born at Marseilles in 1676. He attached himself at an early period of life
                    to the order of the Congregation of the Oratory; but the situation was too
                    confined for his genius, and he soon left it. At Paris he married, became
                    advocate, and entered on this new profession with great approbation and success.
                    Disappointed, however, in his expectations of making a speedy fortune, he
                    abandoned the law; and about this time the peevish humour of his wife occasioned
                    a separation. We next find him as governor to the son of the President de
                    Maisons; and when the premature death of the father deprived him of the fruits
                    of his industry, he engaged with the famous John Law in the same capacity. After
                    the fall of this extraordinary projector, he superintended the education of the
                    Marquis de Beaufremonťs children, and reared pupils worthy oťhis genius and
                    industry. Although he was accused of a tendency to Deism, and there seemed good
                    reason for the accusation, yet he never infused into the minds of his scholars
                    any principle inconsistent with sound morality, or with the Christian religion.
                    When he left Μ. de Beaufremonťs family, he took a boarding house, in which,
                    after a method of his own, he educated a certain number of young men. But
                    unexpected circumstances obliged him to abandon this useful undertaking; and he
                    was even constrained to give some occasional lessons for the bare necessaries of
                    life. Without fortune, without hope, and almost without resource, he was reduced
                    to extreme indigence. In this situation he was found by the authors of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Encyclopedic,</hi> and admitted a partner in conducting that
                    great work. Amongst many other excellent pieces of his, may be mentioned the
                    article <hi rend="italic">Grammar,</hi> which breathes the spirit of sound
                    philosophy. His principles are clear and solid. He discovers an intimate
                    knowledge of the subject, great accuracy in expressing the rules, and perfect
                    propriety in their application. Μ. le Comte de Lauraguais was so much affected
                    with the, distresses, and so much convinced of the merit, of Dumarsais, that he
                    procured him a pension of 1000 livres. Dumarsais died at Paris on the 11th of
                    June 1756, in his eightieth year, after having received the sacrament. The
                    compliment which he paid to the priest on this occasion has been considered by
                    some as rather equivocal. But there is no necessity to deprive religion of the
                    triumph, or philosophy of the honour, which conviction and penitence must confer
                    on it. “The faith of a great genius,” says Bayle, who is entitled to credit on
                    this subject, “is not totally extinguished; it is like a spark under the ashes.
                    Reflection and the prospect of danger call forth its exertions. There arc
                    certain situations in which philosophers are as full of anxiety and of remorse
                    as other men.” Whatever were the last sentiments of Dumarsais, it cannot be
                    denied that in the vigour of health he furnished several examples of irréligion;
                    and to these have been added many absurd stories. The superiority of Dumarsais’s
                    talents consisted in exactness and perspicuity. His ignorance of the world, and
                    of the customs of mankind, together with the greatest latitude in expressing
                    whatever he thought, gave him that frank and unguarded simplicity which is often
                    the chief ingredient of genuine humour. Fontenelle used to say of him, “that he
                    was the most lively simpleton, and as a man of wit the most simple, that he ever
                    knew.” He was the Fontaine of philosophers. In consequence of this character, he
                    was a nice judge of what was natural in every production, and a great enemy to
                    all kind of affectation. His principal works are, 1. Exposition de la Doctrine
                    de ľEg-lise Gallicane par rapport aux prétensions de la Cour de Rome, 12mo. This
                    accurate work was begun at the desire of the President de Maisons, and did not
                    appear till after the death of the author. 2. Exposition ďune Methode raisonnée
                    pour apprendre la Langue Latine, 12mo, 1722, rare. This method appears
                    conformable to the natural development of the powers of the mind, and on that
                    account renders the acquisition of the language less difficult; but, to vulgar
                    and unenlightened understandings, it was liable to two great objections, namely,
                    its novelty, and the censure which it conveyed of the method formerly in use. 3.
                    Traité des Tropes, 1730, 8vo, reprinted in 1771, 12mo∙ This work is intended to
                    explain the different significations of the same word. It is a masterpiece of
                    logical accuracy, perspicuity, and precision. The observations and rules are
                    illustrated by striking examples calculated to show both the use and abuse of
                    rhetorical figures. Yet this excellent book had but very little sale, and is
                    scarcely known. 4. Les Véritables Principes de la Grammaire raisonnée pour
                    apprendre la Langue Latine, 1729, 4to. There was only the preface of this work
                    published, in which he introduced the greater part of his Methode Raisonnée; 5.
                    Abrégé de la Fable du Père Juvenci, arranged after the manner of the original
                    plan, 1731, 12mo; 6. Une Réponse manuscrite à la Critique de l’Histoire des
                    Oracles, par le Père Baltus. There are only imperfect fragments of these papers
                    to be found. 7. Logique, ou Réflexions sur les Opérations de ľEsprit. This is a
                    short tract, which nevertheless contains everything necessary to be known in the
                    art of reasoning. It was reprinted at Paris in two parts, together with the
                    articles which he had furnished for the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie,</hi>
                    1762.</p>
