                <p part="N"><label type="entry">MALACCA</label>, an extensive region of India beyond
                    the Ganges, consisting of a large peninsula, connected, by the isthmus of Kraw,
                    about ninety-seven miles in breadth, with the province of Tenasserim to the
                    north, whilst on all other sides it is bounded by the Eastern Ocean, having on
                    the west the Indian Ocean and the Straits of Malacca, which separate it from
                    Sumatra, and on the east the Gulf of Siam and the Sea of China. It extends from
                    the eleventh to the twelfth degrees of north latitude, and is 775 miles in
                    length, by 125 in average breadth. The country is a long, narrow strip of land,
                    traversed by a chain of lofty mountains, and covered with extensive forests and
                    marshes, so that it is very difficult to penetrate into the interior. A range of
                    extremely bleak mountains runs through it from one extremity to the other; and
                    they give rise to innumerable streams, the courses of which, from the proximity
                    of the mountains to the sea, are short, and they are obstructed at the mouths by
                    bars and sandbanks, so that they cannot be ascended by vessels of any size. At
                    the southern extremity of the continent are the islands of Bintang, Bataug, and
                    Sincapore, with many others, so thickly clustered together, that they are only
                    separated from the continent by narrow straits, and seem to be a prolongation of
                    the land. On the west coast also there are numerous islands, amongst which may
                    be mentioned Pulo Pinang, or Prince of Wales Island.</p>
                <p part="N">The soil is not remarkable for its fertility, though, like other Malay
                    countries, the coast is well covered with wood, and exhibits a great extent of
                    verdure; but the teak tree has never yet been discovered in these forests. The
                    fruits are excellent and plentiful; but grain is not produced in sufficient
                    quantity, and is therefore imported from Bengal and Sumatra. The jungles, from
                    their density and great luxuriance, are impervious to animals, and game is in
                    consequence scarce. From the rivers, as well as the sea, the inhabitants derive
                    a plentiful supply offish.</p>
                <p part="N">The political state of Malacca has been subject to many revolutions,
                    having been occasionally dependent on Siam, when that monarchy was in the height
                    of its power, and when its supremacy was owned by the whole peninsula. But since
                    the Siamese have yielded to the increasing power of the Burmans, all the
                    southern portion of the peninsula has shaken off the yoke; and the northern
                    states pay only a moderate tribute. The whole of the sea-coast, from that
                    latitude to Point Romania, is still possessed by the Malays, who are mixed in
                    some places with the Buggesses from Celebes, and who have still a small
                    settlement at Salengore. The northern and inland parts of the peninsula are
                    inhabited by the Patany people, who appear to be a mixture of Siamese and
                    Malays, and who inhabit independent villages. The negro race is found in the
                    interior amongst the aboriginal natives. The great majority of the inhabitants
                    are, however, of the Malay race, who are well known and widely diffused amongst
                    all the eastern <pb break="no" facs="nls:194200498?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0714-0498-0052"/>islands. The origin of this remarkable race is
                    not very distinctly known. They are understood, however, not to be natives of
                    this country, but to have come originally from the district of Palembang, in the
                    interior of Sumatra, situated on the banks of the river Malaya. Having crossed
                    over about the end of the twelfth century to the opposite continent, they, in
                    1252, founded the city of Malacca. They are of a daring, restless, and intrepid
                    disposition; their character forming in this respect a striking contrast to that
                    of the timid inhabitants of Hindustan. They are brave in war, but ferocious and
                    vindictive, merciless to enemies and strangers, and capricious and passionate
                    even to friends. They are proud and irascible, carrying the point of honour to
                    excess, with a quick sensibility to the slightest insult, which drives them to a
                    degree of fury bordering on desperation; and it is by a series of what they, in
                    their overwrought fancies, consider to be insults, that they are excited to a
                    state of frenzy which ends in that act of wild atrocity known by the name of
                    running amok, from the word <hi rend="italic">amok,</hi> signifying kill, kill.
                    The Malay,when he has resolved on this desperate step, proceeds still farther to
                    inflame his passions, by taking a dose of opium, when he throws loose his black
                    hair, and, drawing his deadly crease, rushes into the streets, thirsting for
                    vengeance, and, crying “kill, kill,” slays every one whom he meets in this
                    furious mood. But it has been found that these unruly passions, which often
                    broke out into violent excesses under the tyrannies of their Dutch rulers, were
                    greatly allayed by kind treatment; and that the Malay, in these circumstances,
                    was transformed into an entirely different character, displaying gratitude,
                    affection, fidelity, and higher sentiments of honour than are found amongst any
                    other class of natives in India. Those Europeans who have engaged them as
                    servants, and who have treated them well, inform us that they found them
                    faithful and attached domestics. The free Malays are an intelligent, active,
                    industrious body of men, engaged, like the Chinese, in foreign trade. They have
                    always addicted themselves to seafaring pursuits, and to piracy, which they
                    follow as if it were a lawful trade; and hence they are the terror of the
                    effeminate Asiatics. Their prows are many of them fine vessels, and navigated
                    with skill; but the Malay, though in general a bold and hardy mariner, is apt to
                    sink under a continuance of cold or bad weather, even sooner than the feeble but
                    more docile lascar of Bengal. Though they have been much circumscribed in their
                    piracies by the maritime superiority of the Europeans in the Eastern Seas, and
                    no longer retain those daring habits which rendered them the scourge of the
                    peaceful trader, they still carry on petty depredations; and trading vessels are
                    sometimes cut off, and their crews murdered with every circumstance of
                    atrocity.</p>
                <p part="N">The government of the Malays is a rude description of monarchy, with a
                    turbulent aristocracy, or something like the principles of the feudal system.
                    The head of the government is a rajah or sultan, a name assumed from the
                    Arabians; and under him a certain number of nobles, with their train of vassals.
                    But in practice there is no regular system of subordination, the king trampling
                    on the chiefs and the people, and they again rebelling against his authority; so
                    that there is little else amongst them but violence and disorder, which
                    contributes to nourish their ferocious habits.</p>
                <p part="N">The language of the Malays has obtained very general currency in several
                    states upon the continent, as well as amongst the eastern islands, though it has
                    gained no footing in the interior of Hindustan. On the sea-coast, and at the
                    mouths and on the banks of navigable rivers, it is the medium of commercial and
                    foreign intercourse; and the currency which it has acquired may be ascribed
                    partly to the commercial and enterprising character of the people, who, by their
                    mercantile habits, or the power of their arms, have established themselves in
                    every part of the archipelago, and also to its own valuable qualities of
                    simplicity in the structure, and even of pronunciation. In writing it, they use
                    the Arabic character, with the addition of six other letters. The Malays have
                    few books in their language, and these consist chiefly of transcripts and
                    versions of the Koran, commentaries on the Mahommedan law, and tales in prose
                    and verse, many of them translations of the popular tales current in Arabia,
                    Persia, India, and the neighbouring island of Java. They have also some
                    historical compositions.</p>
                <p part="N">The Malayans profess the Mahommedan religion. Until the year 1276 they
                    were pagans, or followed some corrupted form of Hindu idolatry. Sultan Mahommed
                    Shah, who ascended the throne in the thirteenth century, was the first prince
                    who, by the propagation of this faith, acquired great celebrity during his long
                    reign of fifty-seven years. His dominion extended over the neighbouring islands
                    of Lingen and Bintang, together with Johore, Patany, Quedah, and Pera, on the
                    coasts of the peninsula, besides several districts in Sumatra, all of which
                    acquired the appellation of Malaya. During part of the fifteenth century,
                    Malacca was under the Siamese sovereigns. In 1509, Sultan Mahmood repelled the
                    aggression of the king of Siam; but in 1511 he was conquered by the Portuguese
                    under Albuquerque.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Malacca</hi> is the capital of the country of
                    Malacca, and is situated on the straits of the same name, near the southern
                    extremity of the Malay peninsula. The town is large; many of the houses are
                    built of stone; and there are several spacious and handsome streets. But that
                    part of it inhabited by the natives consists of bamboo and mat huts. Since the
                    formation of the British settlement at Pulo Pinang, or Prince of Wales Island,
                    its commercial importance has declined. The surrounding country is fertile and
                    beautiful, being finely diversified for eight miles round with hill and dale;
                    and beyond that distance it is rendered impracticable by woods and morasses.
                    There is a good roadstead for large ships, about a mile and a half from the
                    place; but the entrance to the river is rendered intricate by a bar, over which
                    boats cannot pass before quarter flood, nor after last quarter ebb, without much
                    difficulty. Under the lee of the island, near to the fort, there is a harbour,
                    where, in the south-west monsoon, vessels of light burden may be secured. On the
                    southern side of the river is a fort, the walls of which are in a ruinous
                    condition. The chief imports are grain, which is brought in considerable
                    quantities from Bengal, Java, and Sumatra, opium, piece-goods, silks, and
                    dollars. The exports are chiefly tin, pepper, sago, canes, elephants’ teeth,
                    biche de mer, and some gold dust. Fruits and vegetables are abundant; and there
                    is also plenty of buffaloes, hogs, poultry, and fish, at moderate prices, though
                    sheep and bullocks are scarce. Malacca was founded about the year 1252; and in
                    1508 it was first visited by the Portuguese, who, on a quarrel which broke out,
                    were arrested by the king, and being thrown into prison, several of them were
                    put to death. Albuquerque, the renowned Portuguese commander, immediately
                    declared war against this eastern prince; and, after an obstinate contest,
                    stormed the town of Malacca, which became one of their principal settlements,
                    and the key of their trade with the seas beyond India. In 1605 it was attacked
                    by the Dutch, who destroyed a Portuguese fleet in the roads, but failed to take
                    the place. In 1640, however, they reduced it, after an obstinate resistance, and
                    retained it till the year 1795, when it was subjected by a British force, but
                    was restored at the peace of Amiens. It was afterwards recaptured by the
                    British, in whose possession it still remains. Long. 102. 12. E. Lat. 2. 14.
