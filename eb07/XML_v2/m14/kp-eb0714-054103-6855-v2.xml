                <p part="N"><label type="entry">MELODY</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Music,</hi> a
                    succession of sounds ranged in <pb break="no" facs="nls:194206868?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0714-6868-0542"/>such a manner, according to the laws of rhythm
                    and modulation, that it forms a sentiment agreeable to the ear. Vocal melody is
                    called <hi rend="italic">singing;</hi> and that which is performed upon
                    instruments has been termed <hi rend="italic">symphonic melody.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The idea of rhythmus necessarily enters into that of melody. An air is
                    not an air but in proportion as the laws of measure and quantity are observed.
                    The same succession of sounds is susceptible of as many different characters, as
                    many different kinds of melody, as the various ways by which its emphatic notes,
                    and the quantities of those which intervene, may be diversified; and the change
                    in duration ⅛&gt;fthe notes alone, may disguise that very succession in such a
                    manner that it cannot be known. Thus, melody in itself is nothing; it is the
                    rhythmus or measure which determines it, and there can be no air without time.
                    If then we abstract measure from both, we cannot compare melody with harmony;
                    for to the former it is essential, but not at all to the latter.</p>
                <p part="N">Melody, according to the manner in which it is considered, has a
                    relation to two different principles. When regarded only as agreeable to the
                    proportions of sound and the rules of modulation, it has its principle in
                    harmony; since it is an harmonical analysis, whieh exhibits the different
                    gradations of the scale, the chords peculiar to each mode, and the laws of
                    modulation, which are the sole elements that compose an air. According to this
                    principle, the whole power of melody is limited to that of pleasing the ear by
                    agreeable sounds, as the eye may be pleased by an agreeable assemblage of
                    suitable colours. But when considered as an imitative art, by which we may
                    affect the mind with various images, excite different emotions in the heart,
                    inflame or soothe the passions, and produce different effects upon our moral
                    faculties, which cannot be produced by the influence of external sense alone, we
                    must explore another principle for melody; for in our whole internal frame there
                    appears to be no power upon which either harmony alone, or its necessary
                    results, can seize, to affect us in such a manner.</p>
                <p part="N">What, then, is the second principle? It is as much founded on nature as
                    the first; but, in order to discover its foundation in nature, it will require a
                    more accurate though simple observation, and a more exquisite degree of
                    sensibility in the observer. This principle is the same which varies the tone of
                    the voice, when we speak, according as we are interested in what we say, and
                    according to the different emotions which we feel in expressing it. It is the
                    accent of languages which determines the melody of every nation; it is the
                    accent which leads ns to employ the emphasis of speaking whilst wc sing, and to
                    speak with more or less energy according as the language which we use is more or
                    less accented. That language the accents of which are the most sensible, ought
                    to produce the most passionate and lively melody; that which has little
                    accentuation, or none at all, can only produce a cold and languid melody,
                    without character and without expression. These are the true principles. In
                    proportion as we depart from them, when we speak of the power of music upon the
                    human heart, we shall become unintelligible to ourselves and others; our words
                    will be without meaning.</p>
                <p part="N">If music does not impress the soul with images except by melody, if it
                    thence obtains its whole power, it must follow, that all musical sounds which
                    are not pleasing by themselves alone, however agreeable to harmony they maybe,
                    do not form an imitative music; and, being incapable, even with the most
                    beautiful chords, either of presenting the images of things, or exciting the
                    finer feelings, very soon cloy the ear, and leave always the heart in cold
                    indifference. It follows likewise, that notwithstanding the parts which harmony
                    has introduced, and which the actual taste of music so wantonly abuses, wherever
                    two different melodies are heard at the same time, they counteract each other,
                    and destroy the effects of both, however beautiful each may be when performed
                    alone. From this it may be judged with what degree of taste the French composers
                    have introduced into their operas the miserable practice of accompanying one air
                    with another, as well in singing, as in instrumental performances.</p>
                <p part="N">But the causes by which national melody is diversified and
                    characterized, are more profound and permanent than the mere accentuation of
                    language. This indeed may have great influence in determining the nature of the
                    rhythm, and the place of emphatic notes, but very little in regulating the
                    nature of the emphasis and expression themselves. If Rousseau’s principle be
                    true in its full extent, it must of necessity be acknowledged, that an air which
                    was never set or intended for words, however melodious, cannot be imitative;
                    that what is imitative in one nation cannot be so in another; and that, upon his
                    hypothesis, the recitative, which is formed upon the mode of speaking, is the
                    most forcible of all melodies, whieh is absurd. But his other observations are
                    at once judicious and profound. Though it is impossible to exhibit the beauty
                    and variety of harmony by playing the same melody at the same time upon
                    different keys, admitting those keys to form amongst themselves a perfect chord,
                    w hich will of consequence preserve all the subsequent notes in the same
                    intervals; yet this perfect harmony would by no means be uniformly pleasing to
                    the ear. We must therefore of necessity introduce less perfect chords to vary
                    and increase the pleasure, and these chords in any complex system of music must
                    of necessity produce dissonances. It then becomes the business of the composer
                    to be careful that these discords may arise as naturally from, and return as
                    naturally to, perfect harmony as possible. These causes must inevitably have the
                    effect of varying the melody of the different parts; but still, amidst all these
                    difficulties, the artist ought to be zealous in preserving the melody of each as
                    homogeneous with others as possible, that the result of the whole may be in some
                    measure uniform. Otherwise, by counteracting each other, the parts will
                    reciprocally destroy their effects.</p>
