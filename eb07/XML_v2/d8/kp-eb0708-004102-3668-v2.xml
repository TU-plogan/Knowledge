                <p part="N"><label type="entry">DISCRETION</label>, the prudence or knowledge
                    necessary to govern one’s self properly.</p>
                <p part="N">There are many more shining qualities in the mind of man, but there is
                    none so useful as discretion. It is this indeed whieh gives a value to all the
                    rest, whieh sets them at work in their proper times and places, and turns them
                    to the advantage of the person who is possessed of them. Without discretion
                    learning is pedantry, and wit impertinence; virtue itself looks like weakness;
                    and the best parts only qualify a man to be more sprightly in errors, and active
                    to his own prejudice.</p>
                <p part="N">Nor does discretion only make a man master of his own parts, but of
                    other men’s. The disereet man finds out the talents of those he converses with,
                    and knows how to apply them to proper uses. Accordingly, if we look into
                    particular communities and divisions of men, we may observe that it is the
                    discreet man, not the witty, nor the learned, nor the brave, who guides the
                    conversation, and prescribes measures to the society. A man with great talents,
                    but void of discretion, is, like Polyphemus in the fable, strong and blind,
                    endued with an irresistible force, whieh for want of sight is <hi rend="italic"
                        >of</hi> no use to him. Though a man have all other perfections, and yet
                    want discretion, he will be of no great consequence in the world; but if he have
                    this single talent in perfection, and but a common share of other endowments, he
                    may do what he pleases in his particular station of life.</p>
                <p part="N">It is proper, however, to distinguish between <hi rend="italic"
                        >discretion</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cunning</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    the latter being the accomplishment only of little, mean, ungenerous minds.
                    Discretion points out the noblest end to us, and pursues the most proper and
                    laudable methods of attaining them; cunning has only private and selfish aims,
                    and it sticks at nothing whieh may make them sueceed. Discretion has large and
                    extensive views, and, like a well-formed eye, commands a whole horizon; cunning
                    is a kind of short-sightedness, which discovers the minutest objects that are
                    near at hand, but is not able to discern things at a distance. Discretion, the
                    more it is discovered, gives the greater authority to the person who possesses
                    it; cunning, when it is onee detected, loses its whole force, and makes a man
                    incapable of bringing about even those events whieh he might have done had he
                    passed only for a plain man. Discretion is the perfection of reason, and a guide
                    to us in all the duties of life; cunning is a kind of instinct, whieh only looks
                    out after our immediate interest and welfare. Discretion is only found in men of
                    strong sense and good understanding; eunning is often tobe met with even in
                    brutes themselves, and in persons who are but few removes from them. In short,
                    cunning is only the mimic of discretion, and may pass upon weak men for that
                    which it imitates; in the same maimer as vivacity is often mistaken for wit, and
                    gravity for wisdom.</p>
