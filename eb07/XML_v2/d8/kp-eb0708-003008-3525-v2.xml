                        James</hi></label>, a distinguished botanist of the eighteenth century, who
                    may be called the father of cryptogamie botany, was born at Darmstadt in 1687.
                    He was educated as a physician in the university of Giessen; but his attention
                    was very early diverted from ' medical studies to the observation and
                    discrimination of plants; nor does he appear to have ever followed any branch of
                    the practice of physic. In botany he was strictly a practical observer, having
                    addicted himself but little to the principles of classification, and not at all
                    to the physiology of vegetables. Some branches of zoology occasionally engaged
                    him, which an assiduous collector of plants, in their native situations, can
                    hardly escape, so closely are these studies, especially that of insects and the
                    lower tribes of animated beings, connected with botany. Dillenius, whilst at
                    Giessen, wrote several papers for the <hi rend="italic">Ephemerides
                        Natures</hi><hi rend="italic">Curiosorum,</hi> on American plants
                    naturalized in Europe, on coffee, on opium obtained from poppies in Germany,
                    with some minute critical remarks on <hi rend="italic">Spergula pentandra,</hi>
                    as well as on various cryptogamous plants. He published also a paper on leeches,
                    and two species of <hi rend="italic">pαpilio.</hi> He printed at Giessen in 1719
                    his <hi rend="italic">Catalogus Plantarum sponte</hi><hi rend="italic">circa
                        Gissam</hi><hi rend="italic">nascentium,</hi> a valuable little octavo
                    volume, with figures drawn and engraved by his own hand, of the parts of
                    fructification, particularly designed to illustrate the generic characters of
                    plants, previously not well arranged or understood. In this work he established
                    many new genera, which have for the most part kept their ground. His great merit
                    as a general botanist consisted in a constant attention to the only sound
                    principle of scientific botany, the discrimination of <hi rend="italic"
                        >genera</hi> by the parts of the flower and fruit. This principle, first
                    proposed by the great Conrad Gesncr, Dillenius applied to practice, with a
                    severer judgment and closer attention than perhaps any other person, from Gesner
                    to Linnaeus. The little book in question is arranged most inconveniently
                    according to the times of the plants’ flowering. Its preface, however, enters
                    into the subject of classification, a subject to which young botanists are
                    generally prone, but of which they as generally, after having embroiled it, take
                    their leave, in proportion as they acquire more practical knowledge. Dillenius
                    so far displayed his judgment, that he rather showed the faults of the systems
                    of Tournefort, Knaut, and Rivinus, than offered any thing of his own. This led
                    him into some controversies, from which he soon disengaged himself, and never
                    subsequently took up the question at all.</p>
                <p part="N">The great William Sherard, while returning in 1718 from Smyrna through
                    Germany, met with Dillenius, whose scientific merit could not have escaped so
                    eminent a botanist. He brought him to England in 1721, and excited him to
                    publish, in 1724, that valuable enlarged edition of Ray’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Synopsis</hi> of British plants, which has ever since been in general use,
                    and which the editor enriched with engravings of his own. In this publication,
                    compared with the <hi rend="italic">Catalogus</hi> of the plants of Giessen
                    above mentioned, we cannot but perceive the difference between an author working
                    upon his own original materials, and the commentator or illustrator of the
                    labours of another. Though Dillenius made numerous and correct additions to
                    Ray’s work, in the cryptogamie tribes at least, he rather confused than improved
                    the other parts of the book, especially with regard to synonyms, in which
                    department he was never supremely accurate.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1732 Dillenius published his magnificent <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hortus</hi><hi rend="italic">El-thamensis,</hi> in two volumes folio,
                    containing 324 plates, engraved on pewter, with his own hand. Their merit
                    consists in their very great precision and fidelity. The descriptions, and
                    historical as well as botanical remarks, render this a classical book in botany.
                    Its style is good, and the whole performance is worthy of the author, and of his
                    eminent patron, whose brother, Dr James Sherard, was the owner of the garden at
                    Eltham, which furnished the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323538?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0708-3538-0031"/>rich materials of this publication. Before
                    this book appeared, its author was established at Oxford, in the new
                    professorship founded there by the will of William Sherard, who died in August
                    1728, and who left L.3000 for the purpose, besides his own library, manuscripts,
                    and ample herbarium. Dillenius took the degree of M. D. in this university in
                    1735, though he had previously obtained the same rank at Giessen; and he now
                    devoted himself to the completion of the <hi rend="italic">Pinax,</hi> or
                    universal collection of synonyms, which was Sherarďs chief object in this
                    foundation. The work was never finished; for indeed neither Dillenius nor any
                    one else could even at that time be competent to it: still less, as botanists
                    and botanical works multiplied excessively, was this undertaking practicable.
                    The publications of Linnaeus soon rendered it unnecessary. That illustrious
                    foreigner in 1736 visited Dillenius, who was desirous of fixing him here as his
                    coadjutor; but to this scheme there were several impediments. Nevertheless these
                    distinguished men continued ever after in correspondence, certainly to the
                    advantage of their common study, except in one but too important instance. We
                    allude to the theory of the fructification of mosses, in which Linnaeus
                    implicitly adopted the faulty opinion of the Oxford professor, contrary to his
                    own better observation and judgment, taking the capsule for the anther. This
                    leads us to mention the immortal work on which the fame of Dillenius rests, and
                    which, in its way, will never be excelled, the <hi rend="italic">Historia
                        Muscorum,</hi> published in 1741, in one quarto volume, with eighty-five
                    plates, drawn and engraved by the author. In this performance, laborious
                    investigation, acute discrimination, supreme accuracy, and profound learning,
                    are displayed beyond all example or comparison. Following inquirers, like the
                    celebrated Hedwig, may, with better helps, have examined the same objects more
                    deeply; but none has taken so complete a view of the subject, nor made so very
                    few mistakes. No botanical book perhaps is so perfect in synonyms. Whether the
                    labour of this undertaking was too much for the health of its author, or whether
                    his sedentary mode of life was, on the whole, injurious, we have no particular
                    information; but he began, soon after the publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Historia Muscorum,</hi> to complain of ill health and advancing age. He was
                    of a short stature and corpulent habit, and died of an apoplexy on the 2d April
                    1747, in his sixtieth year. A picture of this distinguished botanist is
                    preserved in the picture-gallery at Oxford, from which a print has been
                    published in Sim’s and Konig’s <hi rend="italic">Annals of Botany,</hi> vol. ii.
                    Dillenius is said to have been amiable and respectable in his private character.
                    He never married. His books, collection of mosses referring to his great work,
                    with many drawings, especially of <hi rend="italic">Fungi,</hi> were bought by
                    his successor Dr Humphrey Sibthorp, and added to the Sherardian Museum, where
                    they still remain. (x. χ.)</p>
