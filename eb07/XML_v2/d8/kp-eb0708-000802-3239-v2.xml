                <p part="N"><label type="entry">DIARBEKIR</label>, a city of Asiatic .Turkey, and
                    capital of thepashalic of Diarbekir, situated on a mass of basaltic rock, which
                    rises in an eminence on the western bank of the Tigris, the stream of that river
                    flowing by the foot of this hill from north-east to south-west, as it makes a
                    sharp bend in that direction from the northward. The form of the town is very
                    nearly circular. It is about three miles in circuit, and is encompassed by a
                    lofty thick wall of black stone. This wall, which is supposed tobe a work of the
                    Romans, is fortified by numerous round and square towers at irregular intervals,
                    which being high, and strongly built of hewn stone, present an appearance of
                    great strength. The most strongly fortified portion of the city is on the north,
                    where the square towers are very thickly placed, and there isalongbattery ofguns
                    mounted, pointing through covered embrasures; but the whole is now in a
                    neglected and ruinous condition. The town is also environed by a ditch. The city
                    hasfour gates, which lead toMardin,to Asia Minor or Rumelia, to the mountains of
                    Armenia and Koordistan, and to the river. The citadel, standing about midway
                    between the two last-mentioned gates, is thus in the north-east angle of the
                    town, and, seated on the eminence of rock in that quarter, overlooks the stream
                    of the Tigris below, and, by its elevation, commands the whole of the town. It
                    is surrounded by a wall, is divided into many courts, and contains the palace of
                    the pasha, which is rather a commodious than a splendid building. Attached to it
                    are extensive stables and an open space, in which the horses and the horsemen
                    are exercised. Onc of the places used as a stable presents the ruins of a
                    handsome and noble edifice, with finely-constructed domcs of brickwork, and a
                    beautiful door with columnsand pilasters, the remains, as Mr Buckingham
                    observes, of an old Christian building. The citadel is now almost completely in
                    ruins. There is a fine view of the town from this height. The houses are built
                    of black basalt in the lower stories, and of dark-coloured brick in the upper
                    ones; this, with a succession of flat terraces, gives a sameness and gloominess
                    to the aspect of the town, which, however, is somewhat relieved by the view of
                    the mosques, towers, and little garden-plots seen in different parts of the
                    town. The houses present a handsome appearance, and many of them are elegant. Of
                    the mosques seen from the citadel, there are fifteen with minarets, nine having
                    circular shafts and galleries in the Mahommedan style, and the remaining six
                    having square towers, after the manner of Christian churches. There are five
                    other mosques with domes or cupolas only, and several smąller ones, making
                    altogether twenty-five Mahommedan places of w orship. Among the minarets of the
                    mosques, some were observed by Mr Buckingham, to w hose travels in Mesopotamia
                    we are chiefly indebted for this account of Diarbekir, to be highly sculptured;
                    and in several of the square towers were intermixed layers of red burnt brick,
                    mixed with masonry of stone, after the manner of the Roman towers in the walls
                    of Antioch. Amidst the ruins of the castle some fine arches of highly burnt
                    bricks were also observed, which, from their form, as well as material, looked
                    more like Ro man than Saracenic work. The bazars and baths contain brick work of
                    a similar kind, which Mr Buckingham thinks is decidedly Mahommedan. Broken
                    columns of black coral are seen scattered in different quarters of the town; and
                    among these are several Ionic capitals of Greek origin. Of the Christian
                    churches, the Armenians have two, one of them large and richly decorated, and
                    the other smaller, but more tastefully adorned. The Catholics have one church,
                    with a convent attached to it; the Syrians and the Greeks have also each a place
                    of worship; and the Jews have a small synagogue for their service. There are
                    upwards of twenty baths in the town, and about fifteen khans or caravanserais.
                    The Khan Hassan Pasha is particularly fine; and in its lower court the
                    corn-market is usually held. Its magazines within the piazza, which runs round
                    this, are generally filled with goods. In the upper galleries are carried on
                    several trades and manufactures. There are also convenient lodgings here for
                    travellers; and there is an upper story, with apartments for the harems or
                    families of those who may sojourn here, with kitchens, fire-places, and other
                    domestic conveniences. The bažars are well supplied with goods of all
                    descriptions, and during the hours of business are thronged with people. They
                    arc, however, narrow, crooked, and mostly roofed over with wood, being neither
                    so regularly laid out, nor so well covered in, as they generally are in the
                    large towns of Turkey. The manufactures of the town are chiefly silk and. cotton
                    stuffs, printed muslins, shawls, and handkerchiefs, morocco leather in skins of
                    all colours, smiths’ work in hardware, and pipes for smoking, made of the jasmin
                    branch, covered with muslin, and embroidered with gold and silver thread. About
                    1500 looms are supposed to be employed in the weaving of stuffs; and there are
                    about 300 printers of cotton, with as many manufacturers of leather in the skin,
                    besides shoemakers, saddlers, and other workmen. There are 100 smiths, and 150
                    makers of ornamented pipe-stems, besides those who make the clay-bath, amber
                    mouth-pieces, &amp;c. European cloths are introduced here through Aleppo, as
                    well as most of the glass-ware, which is of German manufacture; fine muslins,
                    Cashmere shawls, spices, and drugs, are brought from India through Bagdad. The
                    common manufactures for domestic uses are supplied at home, and provisions and
                    fruit are abundant and cheap.</p>
                <p part="N">The governor of the pashalic and city of Diarbekir has the dignity of
                    three tails, and is immediately dependent on the sultan. He has a force under
                    him of 1000 men, of whom more than one half arc Turkish cavalry, and the
                    remainder Turkish and Albanian foot. There are, besides, several petty chiefs
                    among the Turks and the Koords, who are bound, for certain privileges which they
                    enjoy, to furnish each his contingent of troops on the pasha’s requisition. The
                    people, though accustomed to despotic rule, consider the government of the pasha
                    as secure; though, according to Mr Buckingham, there were few Turkish towns in
                    which there seemed to be more of personal liberty, competence, and comfort,
                    among all classes of people.</p>
                <p part="N">From the circumstance of the walls and buildings of this city being
                    constructed almost wholly of black stone, it is called by the Turks Kara Amid,
                    or the Black Amid. Its ancient name was Amida; the name of Diarbekir proceeds
                    chiefly from the Arabs, as the name of Amid is still used by the Turks in all
                    their public writings. Amida was successively taken, retaken, and destroyed, in
                    the ancient wars between the Persians and Romans. It was pillaged by Tamerlane
                    in the year 1393; and successive sieges and captures followed by the Persian
                    kings, until it was conquered and taken by Selim, the first sultan of the
                    Osmanlee Turks, in the year 1515. In 1605 it again fell <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193323252?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3252-0009"/>under the
                    power of Persia; but it was afterwards retaken by the Turks, under whose
                    dominion it has since continued. General Gardanne computes the population at
                    80,000, Macdonald Kinneir at 38,000, and Mr Buckingham, the latest traveller, at
                    50,000. The great majority consist of Osmanlee Turks, who are soldiers,
                    government officers, merchants, and mechanics. The Armenians, who are the next
                    numerous class, amount to 1000 families. The Arab, Turkish, and Armenian
                    followers of the Catholic communion number 500 families, the Syrian sect 400,
                    and the Greeks about 50 families. Almost all the Jews have of late emigrated to
                    Bagdad, Aleppo, or Constantinople. The inhabitants of Diarbekir are thought to
                    be more fanatical in their hatred of Christians than in other parts of the
                    empire. This place is 187 miles north-west of Mardin, 220 north-east of Orfah,
                    and 350 north-east of Aleppo. Long. 39. 52. E. Lat. 37. 55. N.</p>
