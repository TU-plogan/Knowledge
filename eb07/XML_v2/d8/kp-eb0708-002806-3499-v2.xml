                <p part="N"><label type="entry">DIGNITY</label>, as applied to the titles of
                    noblemen, signifies honour and authority. Dignity may be divided into superior
                    and inferior; as the titles of duke, earl, baron, &amp;c. which are the highest
                    names of dignity; and those of baronet, knight, serjeant-at-law, &amp;c. which
                    are the lowest. Nobility only can give so high a name of dignity as to supply
                    the want of a surname in legal proceedings; and as the omission of a name of
                    dignity may be pleaded in abatement of a writ, so it may also be where a peer
                    who has more than one name of dignity is not named by the most noble. No
                    temporal dignity of any foreign nation can give a man a higher title here than
                    that of esquire.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Dignity,</hi> in the human character, the opposite
                    of meanness.</p>
                <p part="N">Man is endowed with a sense of the worth and excellence of his nature.
                    He deems it more perfect than that of the other beings around him; and he
                    perceives that the perfection of his nature consists in virtue, particularly in
                    virtue of the highest rank. To express that sense, the term <hi rend="italic"
                        >dignity</hi> is appropriated. Further, to behave with dignity, and to
                    refrain from all mean actions, is felt to be not only a virtue, but a duty: it
                    is a duty which every man owes to himself. By acting in this manner, he attracts
                    love and esteem; by acting meanly, or below himself, he is discommended and
                    contemned.</p>
                <p part="N">This sense of the dignity of human nature reaches even our pleasures and
                    amusements. If they enlarge the mind by raising grand or elevated emotions, or
                    if they humanize the mind by exercising our sympathy, they are approved as
                    suited to the dignity of our nature; but if they contract the mind by fixing it
                    on trivial objects, they are contemned as not suited to the dignity of our
                    nature. Hence in general every occupation, whether of use or amusement, that
                    corresponds to the dignity of man, is termed manly; and every occupation below
                    his nature is termed childish or puerile.</p>
                <p part="N">To those who make a study of human nature, there is a point which has
                    always appeared intricate. How comes it that generosity and courage are more
                    esteemed, and bestow more dignity, than good nature or even justice, though the
                    latter contribute more than the former to private as well as to public
                    happiness? This question, bluntly proposed, might puzzle even a philosopher;
                    but, by means of the foregoing observations, it will be easily solved. Human
                    virtues, like other objects, obtain a rank in our estimation, not from their
                    utility, which is a subject of reflection, but from the direct impression which
                    they make on us. Justice and good nature are a sort of negative virtues, which
                    scarcely make any impression except when they are transgressed. Courage and
                    generosity, on the contrary, producing elevated emotions, enliven the great
                    sense of a man’s dignity, both in himself and in others; and for this reason
                    courage and generosity are in higher esteem than the other virtues mentioned; we
                    describe them as grand and elevated, as of greater dignity, and more
                    praiseworthy.</p>
                <p part="N">This leads us to examine more directly emotions and passions with
                    respect to the present subject; and it will not be difficult to form a scale of
                    them, beginning with the meanest, and ascending gradually to those of the
                    highest rank and dignity. Pleasure felt as at the organ of sense, in other
                    words, corporeal pleasure, is perceived to be low, and when indulged to excess,
                    is perceived also to be mean; for which reason, persons of any delicacy
                    dissemble the pleasure they take in eating and drinking. The pleasures of the
                    eye and ear having no organic feeling, and being free from any sense of
                    meanness, are indulged without any shame; and they even rise to a certain degree
                    of dignity when their objects are grand or elevated. The case is the same with
                    the sympathetic passions; a virtuous person behaving with fortitude and dignity
                    under cruel misfortunes makes a capital figure, and the sympathizing spectator
                    feels in himself the same dignity. Sympathetic distress, at the same time, is
                    never mean; on the contrary, it is agreeable to the nature of a social being,
                    and excites general approbation. The rank which love possesses in the scale
                    depends in a great measure on its objects. It possesses a low place when founded
                    on external properties merely, and is mean when bestowed on a person of inferior
                    rank, without any extraordinary qualification; but when founded on the more
                    elevated internal properties, it assumes a considerable degree of dignity. The
                    case is the same with friendship. When gratitude is warm it animates the mind;
                    but it scarcely rises to dignity. Joy bestows dignity when it proceeds from an
                    elevated cause.</p>
                <p part="N">If we can depend upon induction, dignity is not a property of any
                    disagreeable passion; one is slight, another severe; one depresses the mind,
                    another animates it. But there is no elevation, far less dignity, in any of
                    them. Revenge, in particular, though it inflames and swells the mind, is not
                    accompanied with dignity, not even with elevation. It is not however felt as
                    mean or grovelling, unless when it takes indirect or cowardly measures for
                    gratification. Shame and remorse, though they sink the spirits, are not mean.
                    Pride, a disagreeable passion, bestows no dignity in the eye of a spectator; but
                    vanity always appears mean, and extremely so where founded, as commonly happens,
                    on trivial qualifications.</p>

                <p part="N">The pleasures of the understanding possess a high rank <hi
                        rend="superscript"> z</hi> in point of dignity. Of this every one must be
                    sensible, when he considers the important truths which have been laid open by
                    science; such as general theorems, and the laws which govern the material and
                    moral worlds. The pleasures of the understanding are suited to man as a rational
                    and contemplative being, and they tend not a little to ennoble his nature; even
                    to the Deity he stretches his contemplations, which, in the discovery of
                    infinite power, wisdom, and benevolence, afford delight of the most exalted
                    kind. Hence it appears that the fine arts, studied as a rational pursuit, afford
                    entertainment of great dignity, superior far to what they afford as a subject of
                    taste merely. But contemplation, however in itself valuable, is chiefly
                    respected as subservient to action; for man is intended to be more an active
                    than a contemplative being. He accordingly shows more dignity in action than in
                    contemplation. Generosity, magnanimity, heroism, raise his character to the
                    highest pitch; these best express the dignity of his nature, and advance him
                    nearer to divinity than any other of his attributes.</p>
                <p part="N">Having endeavoured to assign the true cause of dignity and meanness, by
                    unfolding the principle on which they are founded, we proceed to explain the
                    final cause of the dignity or meanness bestowed upon the several particulars
                    above mentioned, beginning with corporeal pleasures. These, as far as useful,
                    are, like justice, fenced with sufficient sanctions to prevent their being
                    neglected. Hunger and thirst are painful sensations; and we are incited to
                    animal lovc by a vigorous propensity. Were corporeal pleasures over and above
                    dignified with a place in a high class, they would infallibly overturn the
                    balance of the mind, by outweighing the social affections. This is a
                    satisfactory final cause for refusing to these pleasures any degree of dignity;
                    and the final cause is not less evident of their meanness when they are indulged
                    to excess. The more refined pleasures of external sense, conveyed by the eye and
                    the ear from natural objects and from the fine arts, deserve a high place in our
                    esteem, because of their singular and extensive utility. In some cases they rise
                    to a considerable dignity; and the very lowest pleasures of the kind are never
                    esteemed mean nor grovelling. The pleasure arising from wit, humour, ridicule,
                    or from what is simply ludicrous, is useful, by relaxing the mind after the
                    fatigue of more manly occupations; but the mind, when it surrenders itself to
                    pleasure of that kind, loses its vigour, and sinks gradually into sloth. The
                    place which this pleasure occupies in point of dignity is adjusted to these
                    views. To make it useful as a relaxation, it is not branded with meanness; to
                    prevent its usurpation, it is removed from that place but a single degree. No
                    man values himself for that pleasure even during gratification; and if it have
                    engrossed more of his time than is requisite for relaxation, he looks back on
                    the circumstance with some degree of shame.</p>
                <p part="N">In point of dignity, the social emotions rise above the selfish, and
                    much above those of the eye and ear. Man is by his nature a social being; and to
                    qualify him for society, it is wisely contrived that he should value himself
                    more on being social than selfish. The excellency of man is chiefly discernible
                    in the great improvements he is susceptible of in society. These, by
                    perseverance, may be carried on progressively, beyond any assignable limits; and
                    even abstracting from revelation, there is a very great probability that the
                    progress begun here will be completed in some future state. Now, as all valuable
                    improvements proceed from the exercise of our rational faculties, the Author of
                    our nature, in order to excite us to a due use of these faculties, has assigned
                    a high rank to the pleasures of the understanding. Their utility, with respect
                    to this life as well as a future one, entitles them to that rank.</p>
                <p part="N">But as action is the aim of all our improvements, virtuous actions
                    justly possess the highest of all ranks. These, we find, are by nature
                    distributed into different classes, and the first place in point of dignity is
                    assigned to actions which appear not the first in point of use. Generosity, for
                    example, in the sense of mankind, is more respected than justice, though the
                    latter is undoubtedly more essential to society; and magnanimity, heroism, and
                    undaunted courage, rise still higher in our esteem, for the reason which has
                    been already explained.</p>
