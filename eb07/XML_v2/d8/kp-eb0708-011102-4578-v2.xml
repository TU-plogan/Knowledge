                    O’Donells, O’Boyles, and M <hi rend="superscript"> ť</hi> Canmeys, were leading
                    families or septs. It is now divided into the six baronies of Bannagh, Boylagh,
                    Innishowen, Kilmacrenan, Raphoe, and Tyrhugh, which are subdivided into
                    fifty-nine parishes, besides four parts of parishes, the remainders of which
                    extend into the adjoining counties. In the commencement of the reign of James I.
                    the number of parishes was eighty-nine.</p>
                <p part="N">The county comprises the whole of the episcopal see of Raphoe, and a
                    small part of that of Derry. The cathedral, which is built in Raphoe, a town
                    otherwise of little notoriety, serves also for the parish church. Four
                    clergymen’s widows are lodged and maintained in the town upon a foundation of a
                    bishop of the name of Foster, who also founded a free school here, and erected a
                    building for a library, the books of which are a bequest from Dr Hall of Trinity
                    College, Dublin. The diocese contains thirtyseven parishes, in which there are
                    thirty-three churches. The total of the glebc land throughout the diocese is
                    estimated at 11,370 acres of ground of every quality, giving an average of 307
                    acres to each parish. The bishop’s income, according to a return made to
                    parliament in 1831, is L.5379. 14s. ld. The barony of Innishowen, and the
                    adjoining district, in the vicinity of the city of Londonderry, arc in Derry
                    diocese.</p>
                <p part="N">The face of the country in the south and east is comparatively level;
                    all the western and northern regions are mountainous, interspersed, however,
                    with valleys and occasional expanses of good land. The most fertile and improved
                    part is the barony of Raphoc, containing the towns of Raphoe, Lifford, and
                    Stranorlar, and embracing a tract about twenty miles long by twelve broad. The
                    soil is good for potatoes, oats, barley, and flax; but wheat, though it thrives
                    in some parts, particularly along the course of the Finn river, is not much
                    cultivated. The southern extremity of the county, in which the town of
                    Ballyshannon stands, can also boast of some rich soil. The mountainous district,
                    which spreads over more than one half of the county, after sloping from Belleek,
                    on the borders of Fermanagh, in the south, to Barnesmore Hills northwards, turns
                    westwards along the sea coast, by Killibegs, to the great promontory of Tellen
                    Head; thence it spreads northwards over the waste expanse of the Rosses, and
                    round by the north coast to Lough Swilly, and by Londonderry through Innishowen
                    barony to Malin Head and Greencastle, where it is interrupted by Lough Foyle,
                    but shows itself again in the northern parts of the counties of Londonderry and
                    Antrim. The highest of these mountains is that of Arragh, which rises 2220 feet
                    above the level of the sea, and is remarkable, not only for its superior
                    elevation, but for one of the whin-dikes that are to be met with in Ireland only
                    near the northern coasts; the dike rising forty feet perpendicularly, like a
                    partition wall. Muckish Mountain, in Kilmacrenan barony, and Slicve Snaght, in
                    Innishowen, are also of considerable height.</p>
                <p part="N">The soil is in general light, with a gravelly subsoil; though in some
                    parts, as in the neighbourhood of Ballyshannon and Donegal, in the south, it is
                    deep and rich, chiefly resting on a bed of limestone. The mountainous districts,
                    though presenting little to excite the speeulations of the agriculturist,
                    possess much to attract the attention of the admirer of nature and the
                    investigations of the scientific inquirer. The rugged precipitous declivities,
                    intersected by winding bays and lakes imbedded in the valleys, exhibit an
                    ever-changing variety of picturesque and magnificent scenery. The geological
                    aspect of these regions affords indications of internal wealth which give fimple
                    grounds for regret that they have been so seldom made the subject of scientific
                    research. The minerals as yet discovered are lead and iron. Mines of the latter
                    of these metals were formerly wrought in the parish of Temple-carne, until
                    relinquished in consequence of the failure of timber for fuel. Manganese, yellow
                    pyrites, and clay for potteries and brick-making, are also found. Siliceous
                    sand, raised in Muckish Mountain, was conveyed in large quantities to Belfast
                    for the manufacture of glass. Indications of coal have been observed near Lough
                    Swilly, and at Inver on the southern coast.</p>
                <p part="N">The rivers, with the exception of the Foyle, which forms the boundary
                    between this county and Tyrone and Londonderry, though numerous, are of very
                    inferior size. The branches of the Foyle which rise in Donegal are the Derg, the
                    Finn, and the Swilly, all of which originate in the central part of the county.
                    The river itself, augmented by their contributions, and by those of several
                    other branches from Tyrone and Londonderry, proceeds in a northern direction,
                    and discharges itself into the southern extremity of Lough Foyle, at the city of
                    Londonderry. It is navigable for vessels of large burden to this place, where
                    their farther progress is prevented by a bridge; and thence by lighters of fifty
                    tons as far as Lifford. Boats of fourteen tons can proceed up the Finn River as
                    far as Castlefinn. The Erne flows from Lough Erne through the southern extremity
                    of the countyjnto Ballyshannon Bay. Its navigation is prevented by a fall of
                    twelve feet in the neighbourhood of Ballyshannon, and by another of thirty feet
                    at Belleek, on the confines of Fermanagh. The Guibarra, the Awen Ea, and the
                    Eask, arc the only other rivers of any note.</p>
                <p part="N">Lakes are numerous but small. Lough Derg, situate in Tyrhugh barony,
                    between the counties of Tyrone and Fermanagh, is the most celebrated, yet not so
                    much on account of its size, which is insignificant, or its scenic beauties, of
                    which it possesses little, as from an island in it, named St Patrick’s
                    Purgatory, which is one of the most <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193324591?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4591-0112"/>celebrated
                    places of resort for pilgrims and devotees in Ireland. The extent of the island
                    is less than an acre. Tlιe cave styled the Purgatory is formed of freestone; it
                    is sixteen feet in length, two and a quarter in breadth, and so low that a man
                    cannot stand upright in it. Several attempts made by the Roman Catholic
                    hierarchy and by the government to prevent the performance of the ceremonies
                    annually practised here have failed; it still continues to be a favourite place
                    of worship. Loughs Eask, Ea, Gar-tan, Fearn, Finn, and Veagh, are worthy of note
                    only as being the sources of some of the rivers which irrigate the country.</p>
                <p part="N">The bays and smaller inlets of the sea are numerous. Ballyshannon
                    harbour, the most southern of them, is small, and has a bar at its mouth, as has
                    Donegal and Inver harbours farther west. Killibegs harbour is well sheltered,
                    and capable of receiving large vessels. On the western coast are Bruckles or
                    M'Swiney’s Bay, and Tellen harbour, suitable for small vessels; and on the north
                    is Sheep Haven, within which is Dunfanaghy Bay, where the largest ships may lie
                    in safety, as they may also in Mulroy Bay, farther east. Still farther eastwards
                    is Lough Swilly, a capacious basin, plunging deep into the land, of easy access,
                    and fit for vessels of any burden. Lough Foyle, the boundary between Donegal and
                    Londonderry, may be more properly considered to belong to the latter county.</p>
                <p part="N">The islands of Arran constitute a small archipelago on the western
                    coast, near the district called the Rosses. The herring fishery was carried on
                    here with great spirit about fifty years ago, but is now nearly extinct, in
                    consequence of the fish deserting the coast. A town called Rutland was built on
                    1nnismacdurn, one of these islands, for cđring and exporting the fish. Tory
                    Island lies off the northern coast, about eight miles from shore. The
                    inhabitants have little intercourse with the rest of the county; they maintain
                    themselves chiefly by fishing and making kelp. An engagement between an English
                    and French squadron took place near this island in 1798. On Ennistrahul Island,
                    off Malin Head, there is a lighthouse. Inch Island, in the southern extremity of
                    Lough Swilly, is of considerable size.</p>
                <p part="N">The following table affords a correct view of the names, extent, and
                    population of the islands along the coast of Donegal, as far as their points
                    have been ascertained, commencing with the most southern.</p>

                    fifty-three schools, containing 3007 pupils, received grants of public money
                    through the agency of a public board. A grammar school was founded in the town
                    of Raphoe by James I., and endowed with a large grant of lands, which it still
                    continues to enjoy under the regulations of commissioners appointed by the
                    crown. Major Robinson, the son of a clergyman in Donegal town, bequeathed a
                    large property for the maintenance of a school in every parish in the diocese of
                    Raphoe, from which every teacher was to receive an annual salary of L.15.</p>
                <p part="N">The manners and habits of the people differ much, according to the local
                    circumstances of the district they inhabit. The lowland and fertile districts
                    are chiefly peopled by an industrious and comfortable yeomanry, composed of
                    small farmers and artizans whose modes of life differ little from those in
                    similar circumstances in the adjoining counties. In the mountainous and less
                    cultivated tracts the want of a free intercourse, and the consequent tardy
                    spread of manufacturing and agricultural improvement, have occasioned a
                    corresponding tardiness in refinement of manners. Yet, so far as the state of
                    crime may lead to a conclusion on this point, the population, though backward in
                    the knowledge of the useful arts, are stained with few of the vices which
                    indicate a demoralized state of society. Out of the total number of committals
                    in 1830, amounting to 781, there were but 406 convictions; but three of these
                    were capital, for horse stealing, and were commuted to transportation for life,
                    and four were for transportation for seven years. Of the remainder, ninety were
                    for illicit distillation, and thirty-seven for riotous assemblages, arising in
                    many cases from the previously named offence. The nature of the country
                    peculiarly favours the operations of the unlicensed distiller; but late
                    statutes, mitigating the demoralizing severity of the revenue code, have already
                    in some degree checked the practice. The houses, particularly in the mountainous
                    parts, are poor. Little attention is paid to cleanliness. The pigs and other
                    cattle, if any, are housed in them along with the family. The fuel is everywhere
                    turf; the food potatoes and oaten bread, with milk and butter occasionally, and
                    fish if near the sea. The men arc clothed in home-made frieze, the women chiefly
                    in cheap cottons. The Irish language still maintains its ground in the retired
                    parts, though its use is every year diminishing. Adepts in the language consider
                    the dialect spoken in this county as the purest known.</p>
                <p part="N">The modes of agriculture present little peculiar to the county. The
                    spadc still supplies the place of the plough in those parts where the rocky
                    nature of the soil prevents the profitable application of the latter implement.
                    In the southern parts a narrow spade with a long handle, and a resting place for
                    the foot only on one side, is in common use. It is called a loy, and is
                    peculiarly adapted to stiff clayey soils. Potatoes are planted with an implement
                    called a steveen or kibbin, formed of a stake about four feet long, shod with
                    iron, and having near the point a cross rest for the foot to act on when forcing
                    it into the ridge; and the seed is dropt into the hole thus made. The cattle
                    which are grazed on the coarse mountain pastures are subject to a kind of
                    rheumatic affection called the cruppan. The animal becomes crippled, and, in the
                    more aggravated stages of the disorder, is totally deprived of the usc of its
                    limbs; the hair on the back starts up, and atrophy succeeds, which terminates in
                    death. The means of cure found most successful is the removal of the diseased
                    animal to soil of another quality. If, however, it should remain for a year on
                    the soil which cures this disorder, it is liable to be attacked by another,
                    called the galar, which causes a discharge of blood, followed by death unless
                    prevented by a transfer to the pastures which had produced the former complaint.
                    Horses are not subject to this latter malady. Feeding on cabbage and sea-rack
                    has been suggested as a means for preventing the ravages of the cruppan. On the
                    shores of Innisfree, one of the islands of North Arran, a species of grass,
                    called by the inhabitants sweet-grass, springs up twelve feet under tide-mark of
                    spring tides. It grows to the length of two or three yards, and is about the
                    breadth of a compressed wheaten straw. At the lowest ebb of the spring tide the
                    cattle run instinctively from the mountains to feed on this herb, as the
                    greatest luxury, and persevere in so doing regularly at the particular period
                    when the recess of the water leaves the plant exposed. In the mountain farms the
                    fences are very bad, being formed of low turf ditches. In many cases the use of
                    fences is disregarded, as a person is either sent to herd the cattle, or they
                    are confined by tethers, <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> The care generally taken
                    to house cattle, in order to prevent the attacks of the cruppan, and to collect
                    manure, rénders the want of fences less injurious.</p>
                <p part="N">The manures in the neighbourhood of the sea are chiefly sca-weed, shelly
                    sand, and house dung. Although the tract from Ballyshannon to Killibegs abounds
                    with limestone and marl, the use of these as manures is not so great as their
                    value, and the facilities of procuring them, would lead those unacquainted with
                    the habits of the people to expect. Irrigation is general, and much encouraged
                    by the landlords. Farming societies have been formed, and premiums offered, in
                    order to excite a spirit of emulation in introducing improved modes of
                    agriculture.</p>
                <p part="N">The herring fishery was carried on about fifty years ago to a great
                    extent, and with considerable success, in the district of the Rosses, on the
                    western coast. In the years 1784k85 the winter fishing produced L.40,000, and
                    supplied cargoes for 300 vessels each year. Such was the success, that a fishing
                    town, named Rutland, with suitable stores and curing houses, was built on the
                    island of Innismacđurn; but the fishery shortly after declined, and has never
                    regained its former character. The decay has been attributed to the summer
                    fishing of what are called sprats, but thought to be the young herrings, which
                    are thus carried off in myriads in a less profitable shape, and the full-grown
                    fish deterred from the coast. Still, however, the fishery is carried on, though
                    on a very reduced and fluctuating scale. The white fishery has latterly been
                    more profitable. The following table will show the progress of both kinds, and
                    the state of the fishing vessels during the period that the fisheries of Ireland
                    were under the superintendence of a board empowered to make grants and loans of
                    public money for their improvement.</p>

                <p part="N">The fishery board also granted money in aid of building fishing piers at
                    Green Castle in Lough Foyle, and Doagh-beg in Lough Swilly. In the project for
                    the plantation of Ulster, drawn up in the early part of the reign of James I.,
                    twenty-five places in this county are named as being approved stations for the
                    salmon, herring, and ling fishery. The principal salmon fishery at present is at
                    Ballyshannon. Whale and sun-fish have been taken near the coast.</p>
                <p part="N">Manufactures never extend much beyond what the immediate demand of the
                    population calls for. They are chiefly confined to linens and coarse woollens
                    called friezes, of which latter a light blue is the favourite colour.</p>
                <p part="N">Numerous ruins of ancient castles along the coast prove that much
                    attention was formerly paid to the defence of the country from invasion, or,
                    what was more to be dreaded, piratical depredations. The principal are,
                    Kilbarron Castle, near Ballyshannon; Donegal Castle, built by O’Donell; Burt and
                    Inch Castles, both built in Lough Swilly, by Sir Cahir O’Dogherty, to whom is
                    also attributed the erection of Green Castle on Lough Foyle. Near the Castle of
                    Doe, or M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Swiney ’ s Castle, at Horn Head, is a
                    natural perforation in the roof of a cave, wrought by the workings of the ocean
                    into the overhanging cliff. It is called M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Swiney
                    ’ s Gun. When the wind blows due north, and the tide is at half flood, the gun
                    is seen to spout up jets of sea water to a great height, attended with
                    explosions which are said to be heard in favourable weather at more than twenty
                    miles distance. Culmore Fort, on the coast of Lough Swilly, is still maintained
                    as a military station, at least so far as to afford a respectable income to some
                    military person who performs the nominal duties of governor there.</p>
                <p part="N">Traces of religious houses, some however existing only in traditionary
                    or documental records, are also numerous. Ashroe Abbey, on the Erne river, near
                    Ballyshannon, was of great extent. The ruins of that of Donegal also afford
                    proofs of its ancient grandeur. But its memory will be held in greater
                    veneration by the lovers of antiquity for another reason. In it was written the
                    celebrated collection of ancient Irish annals, still known by the name of the
                    Annals of the Four Masters, compiled in the year 1632, by Michael O'Clery and
                    his learned coadjutors, fellow brothers in that house, by the instigation and at
                    the expense of Fergal O’Gara, lord of Moy O'Gara and Cool-avin, in the county of
                    Sligo. The original of this curious and highly valuable manuscript is now lodged
                    in the library of the Royal Irish Academy.</p>
                <p part="N">The towns in this county are few and insignificant. Lifford, the county
                    town, is situated near its south-eastern extremity, on the river Foyle, and
                    communicates by a bridge with Strabane, on the eastern bank of the same river,
                    insomuch that it might almost be considered rather as a suburb of this more
                    populous town, than as the metropolis of a county. Its population in 1821
                    amounted only to 976 souls. It can boast of no public buildings but those which
                    owe their existence to the rank for which its position is so ill adapted, as
                    attendance at the assizes here must be extremely inconvenient to residents in
                    most of the other towns, which are chiefly near the sea-coast, at the other
                    extremities. The buildings are a court-house, a prison, and an infirmary.</p>
                <p part="N">The reason given for fixing on a situation for the county town so
                    inconvenient to the resident inhabitants, was, that the judges and barristers
                    were saved the trouble cf travelling far into a county in which the roads at
                    that time were few and ill constructed, and the accommodation in the inns very
                    inferior. The other towns of any consequence, with their population in 1821, are
                    as follows:</p>

                    crossed by a bridge of nine arches, is worthy of notice for its trade, the chief
                    articles of which are corn and salmon; for the remains of antiquity in its
                    immediate vicinity; and for the picturesque scenery with which it is surrounded,
                    and which is much heightened by the salmon leap across the river.</p>
