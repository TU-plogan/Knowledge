                        >Domenico', Lλmpieri,</hi> the celebrated painter, was born at Bologna in
                    1581. He was placed when young under the tuition of Denis Calvart; but having
                    been treated with great-severity by that master, he left him, and became a pupil
                    in the academy of the Caracci, where he remained for a long time. The genius of
                    Domenichino was slow in its development. He was at first timid and distrustful
                    of his powers; whilst his studious, thoughtful, and reserved manners were
                    misunderstood by his companions for dulness. But the intelligent Annibal
                    Caracci, who observed his faculties with more attention, and knew his abilities
                    better, testified of Domenichino that his apparent slowness of parts would in
                    time produce what would be an honour to the art of painting. When his early
                    productions had brought him into notice, he studied with incredible application,
                    and made such advances in painting as to raise his works into a comparison with
                    those of the most admired masters. From his acting as a continual censor of his
                    own works, he became amongst his fellow pupils the most accurate and expressive
                    designer; his colours were the truest to nature, and of the best <hi
                        rend="italic">impasto,</hi> and he proved the most universal master in the
                    theory of his art; in short, the only painter amongst them all, in whom Mengs
                    found nothing to desire, except a somewhat larger proportion of elegance. That
                    he might devote his whole being to the art, Domenichino shunned all society, or
                    if he occasionally sought it in the public theatres and walks, it was in order
                    better to observe the play of the passions in the features of the people,—those
                    of joy, anger, grief, terror, and every affection of the mind, and to commit
                    them vividly to his tablets; and thus, says Belloni, it was that he succeeded in
                    delineating the soul, in colouring life, and calling forth heartfelt emotions,
                    at which his works all aim, as if he waved the same wand which had belonged to
                    the poetical enchanters Tasso and Ariosto.</p>
                <p part="N">After several years’ severe study at Bologna, Domenichino went to Parma,
                    in order to examine the beautiful <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193324422?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4422-0099"/>works of
                    the Lombards, and thence proceeded to Rome, where he assisted Annibal Caracci,
                    and obtained employment through his recommendation from Cardinals Borghese,
                    Farnese, and Aldobrandi, for all of whom he painted works ip fresco, which were
                    justly admired. The distinguished reputation which he had acquired excited the
                    jealousy of some of his contemporaries, who represented his very excellencies as
                    defects. Lanfranco in particular, one of his most inveterate enemies, asserted
                    that his Communion of St Jerome was an imitation from Agostino Caracci, and
                    procured an engraving of this master’s picture of the same subject, copies of
                    which were circulated for the purpose of showing up Domenichino as a plagiarist.
                    But this stratagem only tended to expose the calumnious intents of his rivals,
                    as it was evident that there was no other resemblance in the compositions than
                    what must necessarily be the case in the pictures of two artists treating the
                    same subject; and that every essential part, and all that was admired in the
                    work, were entirely his own. If it had been possible for the exertions of modest
                    merit to have repelled the shafts of slander, the pictures which he painted
                    immediately afterwards, representing subjects from the life of St Cecilia, might
                    have silenced the attacks of envy and malevolence; but they only increased the
                    alarm of his competitors, and redoubled their injustice and malignity. Disgusted
                    with these cabals, Domenichino left Rome for Bologna, where he remained until
                    lie was recalled by Pope Gregory XV., who appointed him principal painter and
                    architect to the pontifical palace. But the persecutions of his enemies
                    continued unabated, and are said to have absolutely wearied out his life. He
                    died, not without suspicion of being poisoned, in 1641.</p>
                <p part="N">Domenichino, in correctness of design, expression of the passions, and
                    simplicity and variety in the airs of his heads, is allowed to be little
                    inferior to Raffàelle. “We must,” says Lanzi, “despair to find paintings
                    exhibiting richer or more varied ornaments, accessaries more beautifully
                    adapted, or more majestic draperies. The figures are finely disposed both in
                    place and action, conducing to the general effect; whilst a light pervades the
                    whole, which seems to rejoice the spirit, growing brighter and-brighter in the
                    aspect of the best countenances, whence they first attract the eye and heart of
                    the beholder.” The persons delineated could not tcll their tale to the ear more
                    plainly than they speak it to the eye. The Scourging of St Andrew, which he
                    executed in competition with Guido at Rome, is a powerful illustration of this
                    truthful expression. Of the two∖vorks of these'masters, Annibal Caracci
                    preferred that of Domenichino. It is said that iιr painting one of the
                    executioners the artist actually threw hittj-sélf into a passion, using
                    threatening words and actions, and that Annibal Caracci surprising him at that
                    moment, embraced him,, exclaiming with joy, “To-day, my dear Domenichinβ, tlïou
                    art teaching me.” “So novel,” remarks Lanzi, “and at the same time so natural,·
                    it appeared to him, that the artist, like the orator, should feel within himself
                    all that lie is representing to others.” Domenichino is universally esteemed as
                    the most distinguished disciple of the Caracci. Algarotti prefers him to the
                    greatest masters; and Nicolo Poussin considered him as the first painter after
                    Raffaelle. His pictures of the Communion of St Jerome, Adam and Ėve, and the
                    Martyrdom of St Agnes, are esteemed amongst his best works. Domenichino was
                    unrivalled in his frescos. He excelled also in landscape painting. In that style
                    the beauty <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> arising from the natural and simple
                    elegance of his scenery, his trees, his well-broken grounds, and in particular
                    the character and expression of his figures, gained him as much public
                    admiration as any of his other performances.</p>
                <p part="N">The worth of Domenichino, as Agucchi foretold, was never rightly
                    appreciated during his lifetime. But the spirit of party which set in so
                    strongly against him whilst living, soon passed away when he was no more; and
                    impartial posterity has done justice to the talents of this illustrious painter,
                    whose works are in the highest esteem, and fetch enormous prices. (z. <hi
