                    gallant Genoese sea officer, born in 1466. He entered into the service of
                    Francis I. of France, but preserved that spirit of independence which is so
                    natural to a sailor and a republican. When the French attempted to render
                    Savona, long the object of jealousy to Genoa, its rival in trade, Doria
                    remonstrated in a high tone against the measure; and this bold action,
                    represented by the malice of the courtiers in the most odious light, irritated
                    Francis to such <hi rend="italic">a</hi> degree that he ordered his admiral
                    Barbesieux to sail for Genoa, then in the hands of the French troops, to arrest
                    Doria, and to seize his galleys. But Doria got a timely hint of this rash order;
                    retired with all his galleys to a place of safety; and, whilst his resentment
                    was warm, closed with the offers of the emperor Charles V. returned his
                    commission with the collar of St Michael to Francis, and hoisted the imperial
                    colours. To deliver his country, now weary alike of the French and the imperial
                    yoke, from the dominion of foreigners, was Doria’s highest ambition; and the
                    favourable moment had presented itself. Genoa was afflicted with the pestilence,
                    and the French garrison being ill paid and greatly reduced, the inhabitants were
                    sufficiently disposed to second his views. He sailed to the harbour with
                    thirteen galleys, landed five hundred men, and made himself master of the gates
                    and the palace with very little resistance. The French governor with his feeble
                    garrison retired to the citadel, but was soon forced to capitulate; upon which
                    the people ran together, and levelled the citadel with the ground. It was now in
                    Doria’s power to have rendered himself the sovereign of his country; but, with a
                    magnanimity of which there are few examples, he assembled the people in the
                    court before the palace, disclaimed all preeminence, and recommended to them to
                    settle what form of government they chose to establish. The people, animated by
                    his spirit, forgot their factions, and fixed that form of government which, with
