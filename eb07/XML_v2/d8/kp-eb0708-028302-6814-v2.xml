                    son of Mr John Dunning of Ashburton, Devonshire, an attorney. He was born at
                    Ashburton, on the 18th of October 1731, and was educated at the free grammar
                    school of his native place, where he soon distinguished himself by his
                    proficiency in classical literature as well as the mathematics. On leaving
                    school he was taken into his father’s office, where he remained until the age of
                    nineteen, when he was sent to the Temple. After he came to the bar he got very
                    slowly into practice. In the year 1762 he was employed to draw up <hi

                    a masterpiece of language and reasoning, and from which he derived not only
                    immediate profit, but such a large share of reputation as secured him extensive
                    practice in his profession.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1763 he distinguished himself as counsel in the memorable proceedings
                    in the case of Wilkes, and his professional business, from that period,
                    gradually increased to such an extent that, in 1776, he is said to have been in
                    the receipt of nearly L.10,000 per annum. In 1766 he was chosen recorder of
                    Bristol, and on the 23d of December 1767 he was appointed to the office of
                    solicitor-general, which he held until the month of May 1770, when he retired,
                    along with his friend Lord Shelburne. In 1771 he was presented with the freedom
                    of the city of London. From this period he was considered as a regular member of
                    the opposition party, and distinguished himself by many able speeches in
                    parliament. He was first chosen member for Caine in 1768, and continued to
                    represent that borough until he was promoted to the peerage. In 1782, when the
                    Marquis of Rockingham became prime minister, Mr Dunning was appointed chancellor
                    of the duchy of Lancaster; and about the same time he was advanced to the
                    peerage, by the title of Lord Ashburton. He died while on a visit to Exmouth, on
                    the 18th of August 1783.</p>
                <p part="N">The person of Lord Ashburton was by no means agreeable or prepossessing.
                    He was a short, thick man, with a sallow countenance, a constant shake of the
                    head, and a hectic cough, which frequently interrupted the stream of his
                    eloquence. His oratory, however, was at once fluent, elegant, and argumentative,
                    and he possessed a sound knowledge of the laws, and of the theory <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> our constitution. His language was pure and classical,
                    yet peculiar to himself, and he had a great fund of wit and humour. His
                    disposition was originally timid, but this defect he overcame by practice, as he
                    became more familiar with forensic habits. Of the great extent of his practice
                    some notion may be formed from the fortune he left behind him, which was all
                    earned by his own exertions, and amounted to no less a sum than L.180,000.</p>
                <p part="N">Sir William Jones has pronounced a splendid eulogium on the character of
                    Lord Ashburton. “His language,” says that accomplished scholar, “was always
                    pure, always elegant; and the best words dropped easily from his lips into the
                    best places, with a fluency at all times astonishing, and, when he had perfect
                    health, really melodious. His style of speaking consisted of all the turns,
                    oppositions, and figures, which the old rhetoricians taught, and which Cicero
                    frequently practised, but which the austere and solemn spirit of Demosthenes
                    refused to adopt from his first master, and seldom admitted into his orations,
                    political or forensic. That faculty, however, in which no mortal ever surpassed
                    him, and which all found irresistible, was his wit. This relieved the weary,
                    calmed the resentful, and animated the drowsy; this drew smiles even from such
                    as were the objects of it; scattered flowers over a desert; and, like sun-beams
                    sparkling on a lake, gave spirit and vivacity to the dullest and least
                    interesting cause. He was endued with an intellect sedate yet penetrating, clear
                    yet profound, subtle yet strong. His knowledge, too, was equal to his
                    imagination, and his memory to his knowledge.”</p>
                <p part="N">Besides the <hi rend="italic">Answer to the Dutch Memorial,</hi> Lord
                    Ashburton is supposed to have assisted in writing a pamphlet on the law of
