                        Francis</hi></label>, an eminent French writer, and member of the Institute,
                    was born of poor parents, at Tryé-Château, between Gisors and Chaumont, on the
                    26th of October 1742. His father, who was a teacher, instructed him in
                    mathematics and land-surveying. The Duke de la Rochefoucault, who accidentally
                    became acquainted with the youth, took him under his protection, and gave him a
                    bursary or exhibition in the College of Harcourt.</p>
                <p part="N">Dupuis made such rapid progress in his studies, that, at the age of
                    twenty-four, he was appointed professor of rhetoric at the college of Lisieux.
                    In his hours of leisure he applied himself to the study of the law, and on the
                    11th of August 1770 he was admitted an advocate before the parliament. He was
                    charged by the rector of the university with the task of delivering the
                    customary discourse at the distribution of prizes; and he was also employed in
                    the name of the university to compose the funeral oration of the Empress Maria
                    Theresa of Austria. These two works having been printed, were admired on account
                    of their elegant latinity, and laid the foundation of the author’s fame as a
                    writer.</p>
                <p part="N">The mathematics having been the object of his early studies, he now
                    devoted his more serious attention to that science; and for some years he
                    attended the astronomical lectures of Lalande, with whom he formed an intimate
                    friendship. In 1778 he constructed a telegraph on the principle suggested by
                    Amontons; and he succeeded so well, that he was enabled to correspond with bis
                    friend Μ. Fortin, who, from the village of Bagneux, where he had a country seat,
                    observed with a telescope the signals made by Dupuis at Belleville, and returned
                    his answer on the following day. In this manner they continued to correspond
                    every year, during the fine season, from 1778 to the commencement of the
                    Revolution. Dupuis then destroyed his machine, lest it should render him
                    suspected in those dangerous times.</p>
                <p part="N">Much about the same time, Dupuis formed his ingenious theory with
                    respect to the origin of the Greek months. In the course of his investigations
                    upon this subject, he composed a long memoir on the constellations. He had been
                    struck with the singularity of the figures by which the groups of stars called
                    constellations were represented on the most ancient planispheres; and had also
                    remarked that these groups did not present to the eye any form analogous to
                    their representations. Hence he concluded, that the real configurations of these
                    constellations, or asterisms, could not have been the origin of the figures and
                    of the names which had been given to them from the highest antiquity. Dupuis
                    attempted to resolve this enigma, in so far at least as related to the
                    constellations of the zodiac. He conceived that this representation of the
                    heavens during the course of the year must have some reference to the state of
                    the earth, and to the labours of agriculture at the time, and in the country, in
                    which these signs had been invented; so that the zodiac was, for the people who
                    invented it, a sort of calendar at once astronomical and rural. It seemed only
                    necessary, therefore, to discover the clime and the period in which the
                    constellation of <hi rend="italic">Capricorn</hi> must have arisen with the sun
                    on the day of the summer solstice, and the vernal equinox must have occurred
                    under <hi rend="italic">Libra.</hi> It appeared to Dupuis that this clime was
                    Egypt, and that the perfect correspondence between the signs and their
                    significations had existed in that country for a period of between fifteen and
                    sixteen thousand years before the present time; that it had existed only there;
                    and thát this harmony had been disturbed by the effect of the precession of the
                    equinoxes. He therefore ascribed the invention of the signs of the zodiac to the
                    people who then inhabited Upper Egypt or Ethiopia. This was the basis on which
                    Dupuis established his mythological system, and endeavoured to explain the
                    curious subject of fabulous history, and the whole system of the theogony and
                    theology of the ancients.</p>
                <p part="N">Persuaded of the importance of his discoveries, which, however, were by
                    no means entirely original, Dupuis published several detached parts of his
                    system in the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Savants</hi> for the months of June,
                    October, and December 1777, and of February 1781, which he afterwards collected
                    and published, first in Lalande’s <hi rend="italic">Astronomy,</hi> and then in
                    a separate volume in 4to, 1781, under the title of <hi rend="italic"

                    acknowledgment of the erudition and ingenuity exhibited by the author.</p>
                <p part="N">Condorcet proposed Dupuis to Frederick the Great of Prussia as a fit
                    person to succeed Thiebault in the professorship of literature at Berlin; and
                    Dupuis had accepted the invitation, when the death of the king put an end to the
                    engagement. The chair of humanity in the college of France having at the same
                    time become vacant by the death of Μ. Bejot, it was conferred on Dupuis; and in
                    1788 he became a member of the Academy of Inscriptions. He now resigned his
                    professorship at Lisieux, and was appointed by the administrators of the
                    department of Paris one of the four commissioners of public instruction.</p>
                <p part="N">At the commencement of the revolutionary troubles Dupuis sought an
                    asylum at Evreux; and having been chosen a member of the national convention by
                    the department<pb break="no" facs="nls:193326866?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0708-6866-0287"/> of the Seine and Oise, he distinguished
                    himself by the moderation of his speeches and public conduct. In the third year
                    of the republic he was elected secretary to the assembly, and in the fourth he
                    was chosen a member of the council of Five Hundred. After the memorable 18th of
                        <hi rend="italic">Brumaire</hi> he was elected by the department of the
                    Seine and Oise a member of the legislative body, of which he became the
                    president. He was afterwards proposed as a candidate for the senate; and here
                    terminated his political career.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1794 he published his large work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Origine
                        de tous les Cultes, ou la</hi><hi rend="italic">Religion</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Universelle,</hi> 3 vols. 4to, with an atlas, or 12 vols.
                    12mo. This work excited considerable sensation at first; it gave umbrage to
                    many, was attacked and defended with warmth, at length ceased to be read, and
                    fell into utter neglect. In 1798 he published an abridgment of this work in one
                    volume 8vo, which nιct with no better success. Another abridgment of the same
                    work, executed upon a much more methodical plan, was published by Μ. de Tracy.
                    The other works of Dupuis consist of two memoirs on the <hi rend="italic"

                    published the same year, in one volume 4to. It was from the perusal of the poem
                    of <hi rend="italic">Nonnus,</hi> which he once thought of translating into
                    French, and of which a fragment was printed in the <hi rend="italic">Nouvel

                    him several manuscripts on subjects connected with the works which he had
                    published during his life. He was a member of the legion of honour; and his
                    character was that of an honest man and a paradoxical writer. He was born poor,
                    and never acquired any fortune. Μ. Dacier, secretary to the third class of the
