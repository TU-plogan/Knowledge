                    counterfeit stone, composed of two pieces of crystal, and sometimes glass
                    softened, together with proper colours between them; so that they make the same
                    appearance to the eye as if the whole substance of the crystal had been tinged
                    with these colours.</p>
                <p part="N">The impracticability of imparting tinges to the body of crystals, while
                    in their proper and natural state, and the softness of glass, which renders
                    ornaments made of it greatly inferior in wear to crystal, offer inducements to
                    the introduction of colouring the surface of crystal wrought in a proper form,
                    in such a manner that the surfaces of two pieces so coloured being laid
                    together, the effect may appear the same as if the whole surface of the crystal
                    had been coloured. The crystals, and sometimes white transparent glass so
                    treated, were called <hi rend="italic">doublets,</hi> and at one time prevailed
                    greatly in use, on account of the advantages with respect to wear which such
                    doublets had, when made of crystal, over glass, and the brightness of the
                    colours which could with certainty be given to counterfeit stones in this way,
                    when coloured glass could not be procured, or at least not without a much
                    greater expense. Doublets have not indeed the property which the others have, of
                    bearing to bc set transparent, as is frequently required in drops of ear-rings
                    and other ornaments; but when mounted in rings, or used in such a manner that
                    the sides of the pieces where the joint is made cannot be inspected, they have,
                    when formed of crystal, the title to a preference over the coloured glass; and
                    the art of managing them is therefore, in some degree, of the same importance
                    with that of preparing glass for counterfeiting gems, and is properly an
                    appendage to it, as being entirely subservient to the same intention. The manner
                    of making doublets may be shortly described.</p>
                <p part="N">Let the crystal or glass be first cut by the lapidaries in the manner of
                    a brilliant, except that, in this case, the figure must be composed of two
                    separate stones, or parts of stones, formed in the manner of the upper and under
                    parts of a brilliant, if it was divided into a horizontal direction, a little
                    lower than the middle. After the two plates of the intended stone are thus cut,
                    and fitted so exactly that no division can appear when they are laid together,
                    the upper part must be polished ready for setting; and then the colour must be
                    put betwixt the two plates by the following method. Take of Venice or Cyprus
                    turpentine two scruples; and add to it one scruple of the grains of mastich
                    choseri perfectly pure, free from foulness, and previously powdered. Melt them
                    together in a small silver or brass spoon, ladle, or other vessel, and add to
                    them gradually any of the coloured substances mentioned below, but well
                    powdered; stirring them together as the colour is put in, that they may be
                    thoroughly commixed. Then warm the doublets to the same degree of heat as the
                    melted mixture, paint the surface of the lower part, and put the upper one
                    instantly upon it, pressing them to each other, but taking care that they may be
                    conjoined in the most perfectly even manner. When the cement or paint is quite
                    cold and set, the redundant part of it, which has been pressed out of the joint
                    of the two pieces, should be gently scraped off the side, till there be no
                    appearance of any colour on the outside of the doublets; and they should then be
                    skilfully set; observing to carry the mounting over the joint, that the upper
                    piece may be well secured from separating from the under one.</p>
                <p part="N">The colour of the ruby may be best imitated by mixing a fourth part of
                    carmine with some of the finest crimson lake that can be procured. The sapphire
                    may be counterfeited with very bright Prussian blue, mixed with a little crimson
                    lake, to give it a cast of the purple. The Prussian blue should not be very
                    deeply coloured, or but little of it should be used, otherwise it will give a
                    black shade that will be injurious to the lustre of the doublets. The emerald
                    maybe well counterfeited with distilled verdigris, to which is added a little
                    powdered aloes. But the mixture should not be strongly heated, or kept long over
                    the fire after the verdigris has been added. The resemblance of the garnet may
                    be made with dragon’s blood; which, if it cannot be procured of sufficient
                    brightness, may be helped by a very small quantity of carmine. The amethyst
                    maybe imitated with the mixture of some Prussian blue with the crimson lake; but
                    the proportions can only be regulated by direction, as different parcels of the
                    lake and Prussian blue vary extremely in the degree of strength of the colour.
                    The yellow topazes may be counterfeited by mixinig the powdered aloes with a
                    little dragon’s blood, or by good Spanish arnotto; but the colour must be very
                    sparingly used, or the tinge will be too strong for the appearance of that
                    stone. The chrysolite, hyacinth, vinegar garnet, aqua-marine, and other such
                    weaker or more diluted colours, may be formed in the same manner, by lessening
                    the proportions of the colours, or by compounding them together corresponding to
                    the hue of the stone to be imitated; for which purpose it is proper to have an
                    original stone, or an exact imitation of one, at hand when the mixture is made,
                    in order to adapt the colours to the effect desired.</p>
                <p part="N">There is an easy method of distinguishing doublets, which is only to
                    behold them betwixt the eye and light, in such a position that the light may
                    pass through the upper part and corners of the stone; when it will easily be
                    perceived that there is no colour in the body of the stone.</p>
