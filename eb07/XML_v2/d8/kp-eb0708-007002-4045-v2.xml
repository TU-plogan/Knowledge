                type="entry">
                <p part="N"><label type="entry">DIVISIBILITY</label>, that property by which the
                    particles of matter in all bodies are capable of separation or disunion from one
                    another.</p>
                <p part="N">As it is evident that body is extended, so it is no less so that it is
                    divisible; for since no two particles of matter can exist in the same place, it
                    follows that they are really distinct from each other; which, indeed, is all
                    that is meant by being divisible. In this sense the least conceivable particle
                    must still be divisible, since it consists of parts which are really distinct.
                    To illustrate this by a familiar instance, let the least imaginable piece of
                    matter be conceived lying on a smooth plain surface; it is evident the surface
                    will not touch it everywhere, and those parts, therefore, which it does not
                    touch may be supposed separable from the others, and so on as far as we please.
                    And this is all that is meant when we say that matter is infinitely
                    divisible.</p>
                <p part="N">All that is supposed in strict geometry, says Mr Maclaurin, concerning
                    the divisibility of magnitude, amounts to no more than that a given magnitude
                    may be conceived to be divided into a number of parts equal to any given or
                    proposed number. It is true that the number of parts into which a given
                    magnitude may be conceived to bc divided is not to be fixed or limited, because
                    no given number is so great but a greater may be conceived and assigned; but
                    there is not, therefore, any necessity for supposing the number of parts
                    actually infinite; and if some have drawn very abstruse consequences from such a
                    supposition, yet geometry ought not to be loaded with these.</p>
                <p part="N">How far matter is actually capable of being divided, may in some measure
                    be conceived from this, that a piece of wire gilt w ith so small a quantity as
                    eight grains of gold, may be drawn out to a length of 13,000 feet, the whole
                    surface of it still remaining covered with gold. We have also a surprising
                    instance of the minuteness of some parts of matter in the nature of light and
                    vision. Let a candle be lit and placed in an open plain, it will then be visible
                    for about two miles round; and consequently, were it placed two miles above the
                    surface of the earth, it would fill with luminous particles a sphere four miles
                    in diameter, and this before it had lost any sensible part of its weight.</p>

                <p part="N">A quantity of vitriol being dissolved, and mixed with nine thousand
                    times as much water, will tinge the whole; consequently it will be divided into
                    as many parts as there are visible portions of matter in that quantity of water.
                    There are perfumes which, without a sensible diminution of their quantity, will
                    fill a very large space with their odoriferous particles, which must therefore
                    be of an inconceivable smallness, since there are a sufficient number in every
                    part of that space sensibly to affect the organ of smelling. Dr Keill
                    demonstrates, that any particle of matter, how small soever, and any finite
                    space, how large soever, being given, it is possible for that small particle of
                    matter to be diffused through all that space, and to fill it in such a manner as
                    that there shall be no pore in it whose diameter shall exceed any given
                    line.</p>
                <p part="N">The chief objections against the divisibility of matter <hi
                        rend="italic">in infinitum</hi> are, that an infinite cannot be contained by
                    a finite; and that it follows from a divisibility <hi rend="italic">in
                        infinitum,</hi> either that all bodies are equal, or that one infinite is
                    greater than another. But the answer to these objections is easy; for the
                    properties of a determinate quantity are not to be attributed to an infinite
                    considered in a general sense; and who has ever proved that there could not be
                    an infinite number of infinitely small parts in a finite quantity, or that all
                    infinites are equal? The contrary is demonstrated by mathematicians in
                    innumerable instances.</p>
