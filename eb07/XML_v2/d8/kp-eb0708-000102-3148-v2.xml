                <p part="N"><label type="entry">DIALOGUE</label>, in literature and in common life,
                    a conversation between two or more persons, and either written or oral.</p>
                <p part="N">As the end of speech is conversation, no kind of writing can be more
                    natural than dialogue, which represents this. Accordingly we find it was
                    introduced at a very early period; for there are several instances of it in the
                    Mosaic history. The ancient Greek writers, especially the philosophers, also
                    fell very much into dialogue, as the most convenient and agreeable method of
                    communicating their sentiments and instructions to mankind. And indeed it seems
                    to be attended with very considerable advantages, if well and judiciously
                    managed; for it is capable of rendering the driest subjects entertaining and
                    pleasant, by its variety, and by the different characters of the speakers.
                    Besides, things may be canvassed more minutely, and many lesser matters, which
                    serve to clear up a subject, may be introduced with better grace, by means of
                    questions and answers, objections and replies, than can be con-venientlydone in
                    a continued discourse. There is likewise a further advantage in this way of
                    writing, that the author is at liberty to choose his speakers; and therefore, as
                    Cicero has well observed, that when we imagine that we have persons of an
                    established reputation for wisdom and knowledge talking together, this
                    circumstance necessarily addsaweight and authority to the discourse, and more
                    closely engages the attention. The subject-matter of dialogue is very extensive;
                    for whatever is a proper argument of discourse, public or private, serious or
                    jocose—whatever is fit for wise and ingenious men to talk upon, either for
                    improvement or diversion—is suitable for a dialogue.</p>
                <p part="N">From this general account of the nature of dialogue, it is easy to
                    perceive what kind of style best suits it. Its affinity with epistles shows
                    there ought to be no great difference between them in this respect. Indeed, some
                    have been of opinion that it ought rather to sink below the style of an epistle,
                    because dialogues should in all respects represent the freedom of conversation,
                    whereas epistles ought sometimes to be composed with care and accuracy,
                    especially when written to superiors. But there seems to be little weight in
                    this argument, since the design of an epistle is to say the same things, and in
                    the same manner, as the writer judges would be most fit and proper for him to
                    speak if present; and in a dialogue the design is similar with respect to the
                    several persons concerned in it. Upon the whole, therefore, a plain, easy, and
                    simple style, suited to the nature of the subject, and the particular characters
                    of the persons concerned, seems to be alike suitable to both.</p>
                <p part="N">But as greater skill is required in writing dialogues than letters, we
                    shall give a more particular account of the priqcipal things necessary to be
                    regarded in their composition, and illustrate them chiefly from Cicero’s
                    excellent dialogues concerning an orator. A dialogue then consists of two parts;
                    an <hi rend="italic">introduction,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the body of the
                        discourse.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">introduction</hi> acquaints us with the place,
                    time, persons, and occasion of the conversation. Thus Cicero places the scene of
                    his dialogues at the country seat of Crassus; a very proper retreat, both for
                    such a debate and the parties engaged in it. And as they were persons of the
                    first rank, employed in the greatest affairs of the state, and as the discourse
                    occupied them for two days, he represents it to have happened at the time of a
                    festival, when no business was done at Rome, and an opportunity was thus
                    afforded them of being absent.</p>
                <p part="N">And because the greatest regard should be had in the choice of the
                    persons, who ought to be such as are well acquainted with the subject upon which
                    they discourse, in these dialogues of Cicero the two principal disputants are
                    Crassus and Antony, the greatest orators of that age, and therefore the most
                    proper persons to dispute respecting the qualifications essential for their art.
                    One would think it scarcely necessary to observe that the corfference should be
                    held by persons who lived at the time, and thus were capable of conversing
                    together. But yet some good writers have run into the impropriety of feigning
                    dialogues between persons who had lived at distant times. Plato adopted this
                    method, in which he has been followed by Macrobius. But others, who have been
                    willing to bring persons to discourse together who lived in different ages,
                    without such inconsistency, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323161?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0708-3161-0002"/>have written dialogues of the dead. Lucian has
                    made himself most remarkable in this way. As to the number of persons in a
                    dialogue, they may bc more or fewer; so many as can conveniently carry on a
                    conversation without disorder or confusion, or they may be only two. Some of
                    Cicero’s dialogues have but two, others three or more, and those concerning an
                    orator seven. But it is convenient in some respects that they should all be
                    persons of different characters and abilities; a circumstance which contributes
                    both to the variety and beauty of the discourse, like the different attitudes of
                    figures in a picture. Thus, in Cicero’s dialogues last mentioned, Crassus
                    excelled in art, Antony principally by the force of his genius, Catullus by the
                    purity of his style, Scevola by his skill in the law, Caesar by wit and humour;
                    and Sulpitius and Cotta, though young men, were both excellent orators, yet they
                    differed in their manner. But there should be always one principal person,
                    having the main part of the conversation; like the hero in an epic poem or a
                    tragedy, who excels the rest in action, or the principal figure in a picture,
                    which is always made the most conspicuous. In Plato’s dialogues this is
                    Socrates, and Crassus in those of Cicero above mentioned.</p>
                <p part="N">It is usual likewise, in the introductions, to acquaint us with the
                    occasion of the discourse. Indeed this is not always mentioned; as in Cicero’s
                    dialogue concerning the parts of oratory, where the son begins immediately with
                    desiring his father to instruct him in the art. But it is generally taken notice
                    of, and most commonly represented as accidental; the reason of which may be,
                    that such discourses appear most natural, and may likewise afford some kind of
                    apology for the writer in managing his different characters, since the greatest
                    men may be supposed not always to speak with the utmost exactness in an
                    accidental conversation. Thus Cicero, in his dialogues concerning an orator,
                    makes Crassus occasionally fall upon the subject of oratory, in order to divert
                    the company from the melancholy thoughts of what they had been discoursing of
                    before, with relation to the public disorders, and the dangers which threatened
                    their common country. But the introduction ought not to be too long and tedious.
                    Mr Addison complains of this fault in some authors who employ dialogue. “For
                    though,” as he says, “some of the finest treatises of the most polite Latin and
                    Greek writers are in dialogue, as many very valuable pieces of French, Italian,
                    and English, appear in the same dress; yet in some of them there is so much time
                    taken up in ceremony, that, before they enter on their subject, the dialogue is
                    half over.”</p>
                <p part="N">We come now to the <hi rend="italic">body</hi> of the discourse, in
                    which some things relating to the persons, and others to the subject, are proper
                    to be remarked.</p>
                <p part="N">And as to the <hi rend="italic">persons,</hi> the principal thing tobe
                    attended to is to keep up a justness and consistency of character throughout the
                    whole. And the distinct characters ought to be so perfectly observed, that even
                    from the very words it may be always known who is the speaker. This renders
                    dialogue more difficult than single description, by reason of the number and
                    variety of characters which are to be drawn at the same time, and each of them
                    managed with the greatest propriety. The principal speaker should appear to be a
                    person of great sense and wisdom, and best acquainted with the subject. No
                    question ought to be asked him, nor objection started, but what he should fairly
                    answer; and all that is said by the rest should principally tend to promote his
                    discourse, and carry it through in the most artful and agreeable mannër. When
                    the argument is attended with difficulties, one other person or more, of equal
                    reputation, or nearly so, but of different sentiments, should be introduced to
                    oppose him, and maintain the contrary side of the question. This affords an
                    opportunity for a thorough examination of the point on both sides, and for
                    answering all objections. But if the combatants are not pretty equally matched,
                    and masters of the subject, they will treat it but superficially. Through the
                    whole debate, however, there ought not to be the least wrangling, peevishness,
                    or obstinacy; nothing indeed but the appearance of good humour and good
                    breeding, together with a readiness to submit to conviction and the force of
                    truth, according as the evidence shall appear to be on one side or the other. In
                    Cicero, these two characters are Crassus and Antony; and from them Mr Addison
                    seemă to have taken his Philander and Cynthio in his <hi rend="italic">Dialogues
                        upon the Usefulness of Ancient Medals,</hi> which are formed pretty much
                    upon Cicero’s plan. When younger persons are introduced, or such as are not
                    equally acquainted with the subject, they should rather be inquisitive than
                    disputative; and the questions they ask should bc neither too long nor too
                    frequent, in order that they may not too much interrupt the debate, nor appear
                    over talkative before wiser and more experienced persons. Sulpitius and Cotta
                    sustain this character in Cicero, and Eugenius in Mr Addison. It is very
                    convenient, however, that there should be one person of a witty and jocose
                    humour, to enliven the discourse at proper seasons, and render it the more
                    entertaining, especially when the dialogue is drawn out to any considerable
                    length. Caesar performs this part in Cicero; and in Mr Addison, Cynthio, a
                    person of a similar turn, opposes Philander in a humorous way. Mr Addison’s
                    subject admitted of this; but the seriousness and gravity of Cicero’s argument
                    required a different speaker for the jocose part. Many persans ought not to
                    speak immediately after one another; though Scaliger and others think a fourth
                    person may sometimes be permitted to speak in the same scene without confusion.
                    However, if this is not commonly allowed upon the stage, where the actors are
                    present, and maybe distinguished by their voice and habit; much less should it
                    be so in a dialogue, where we have only their names to distinguish them.</p>
                <p part="N">With regard to the <hi rend="italic">subject,</hi> all the arguments
                    should appear probable at least, and nothing should be advanced which may seem
                    weak or trivial. There ought also to be an union in dialogue, in order that the
                    discourse may not ramble, but keep up to the main design. Indeed, short and
                    pleasant digressions are sometimes allowable, for the ease and entertainment of
                    the reader; but every thing should be so managed that he may still be able to
                    carry on the thread of the discourse in his mind, and keep the main argument in
                    view, till the whole be finished. The writers of dialogue have not confined
                    their discourses to any certain space of time, but either concluded them with
                    the day, or broken off' when their speakers have been tired, and resumed them
                    again the next day. Thus Cicero allows two days for his three dialogues
                    concerning an orator; but Mr Addison extends his to three days, allowing a day
                    for each. But the same method has not always been observed in composing
                    dialogues; for sometimes the writer, by way of narrative, relates a discourse
                    which passed between other persons. Such are the dialogues of Cicero and Mr
                    Addison last mentioned, and many others both of the ancients and moderns. But at
                    other times the speakers are introduced in person as talking to each other.
                    This, as Cicero observes, prevents the frequent repetition of those words, “he
                    said,” and “he replied ;” and by placing the hearer, as it were, in the
                    conversation, gives him a more lively representation of the discourse, and thus
                    makes it the more affecting. In this manner, therefore, Cicero wrote his <hi
                        rend="italic">Dialogue of Old Age,</hi> in which Cato, who was then advanced
                    in years, recounts the satisfaction of life which may be enjoyed in old age;
                    and, in fact, he tells his friend <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193323174?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3174-0003"/>Atticus he
                    was himself so affected with that discourse, that when he reviewed it, he
                    sometimes fancied they were not his own words, but Cato’s. There are some other
                    dialogues of Cicero written in the same way; and both Plato and Lucian generally
                    chose this method.</p>
