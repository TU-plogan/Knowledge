                        Pineau</hi></label>, a French author of some celebrity, was bom at Dinant,
                    in Bretagne, in the year 1704. At an early age he was sent to study at Paris.
                    The imprudence of youth, and his love of pleasure, led him at first to contract
                    certain intimacies which were little .suited to his circumstances; but having
                    afterwards disengaged himself from these, he courted the society of all the wits
                    or his time, by whom he was well received. He became a member of that club, or
                    association of young men, who published their juvenile productions under the
                    titles of <hi rend="italic">Recueil</hi><hi rend="italic">de ces Messieurs,
                        Etrennes de lα St Jean,</hi><hi rend="italic">OEufs de Pâques,</hi> &amp;c.
                    The romance of <hi rend="italic">Acajou and Zir-phile,</hi> which was composed
                    after a series of plates which had been engraved for another work, was one of
                    the fruits of this association, and was produced in consequence of a sort of
                    wager amongst its members. The epistolary dedication to the public, which was
                    prefixed to this trifle, gave umbrage to some, in consequence of the flippant
                    tone which the author assumed. Duclos had previously written two other romances,
                    which were more favourably received: <hi rend="italic">The Baroness de Luz,</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Confessions</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Count de
                        ***.</hi> His first serious publication was the <hi rend="italic">History of
                        Louis XI.</hi> The style of this work is dry and epigrammatical, but the
                    author has displayed in it considerable powers of research, and preserved the
                    character of an impartial historian. The reputation of Duclos as an author was
                    confirmed by the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Considerations</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">sur les Moeurs,</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> work which is
                    much praised by Laharpe, and not without justice; for although the style, as in
                    most of the writings of this author, is rather stiff and sententious, the book
                    undoubtedly contains a great deal of just and ingenious reflection. It was
                    translated both into English and German. The <hi rend="italic">Mémoires pour
                        servir</hi><hi rend="italic">a Γ</hi><hi rend="italic">Histoire du
                        dix-huitième Siècle,</hi> which were intended by the author as a sort of
                    sequel to the preceding work, are nevertheless much inferior both in respect of
                    style and matter, and are, in reality, little better than a kind of romance. In
                    consequence of his <hi rend="italic">History of Louis XL</hi> he was appointed
                    historiographer of France, when that place became vacant on Voltaire’s
                    retirement to Prussia. His <hi rend="italic">Secret Memoirs of the Reign of
                        Louis XIV. and Louis XV.</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Considerations on
                        Italy,</hi> were not published until after the revolution. The former work
                    is highly spoken of by Chamfort.</p>
                <p part="N">Duclos became a member of the Academy of Inscriptions in 1739, and of
                    the French Academy in 1747. Of the latter he was appointed perpetual secretary
                    in 1755. Both of these academies were indebted to him, not only for many
                    valuable contributions, but likewise for several useful regulations and
                    improvements. As a member of the Academy of Inscriptions, he composed several
                    memoirs on the Druids; on the origin and revolutions of the Celtic and French
                    languages; on trial by battle, and proof by ordeal; and on scenic
                    representations, and the ancient drama. As a member of the French Academy, he
                    assisted in compiling the new edition of the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi>
                    which was published in 1762; and he made some just and philosophical remarks on
                    the <hi rend="italic">Port Royal Grammar.</hi> On several occasions he
                    resolutely supported the honour and prerogatives of the societies to which he
                    belonged, and maintained the respectability of the literary character in
                    general. He used to say of himself, “I shall leave behind me a name dear to
                    literary men.” His fellow-citizens, whose interests he always supported with
                    zeal, appointed him mayor of their town in 1744, although he was resident at
                    Paris. He was afterwards elected deputy from the commons to the assembly of the
                    states of Bretagne; and upon the requisition of this body the king granted him
                    letters of nobility.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1766 he was advised to retire from France for some time, in order
                    that the government might have an opportunity of forgetting some opinions which
                    he had hazarded, on the subject of the dispute between the Due d’Aiguillon and
                    M. de la Chalotais, the friend and countryman of Duclos. Accordingly he set out
                    for Italy, and, on his return, he wrote an account of his travels, which is also
                    praised by Chamfort. He died at Paris on the 26th of March 1772, in the
                    sixty-ninth year of his age.</p>

                <p part="N">The'character of Duclos, although it exhibited many singular traits, was
                    still respectable, whether we consider him as a man or as an author. Rousseau
                    described him very laconically as a man, <hi rend="italic">droit</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">adroit.</hi> In his manners he
                    displayed a sort of bluntness in society, which frequently rendered him
                    disagreeable; and his caustic wit on many occasions created enemies. To those
                    who knew him, however, he was a pleasant companion. He was a great lover of
                    anecdotes, and had the talent of relating them in a very agreeable manner. A
                    considerable number of his good sayings have been preserved by his
                    biographers.</p>
                <p part="N">A complete edition of the works of Duclos was published by Desessarts,
                    at Paris, in 10 vols. 8vo, 1806. (See <hi rend="italic">Biog.</hi><hi
