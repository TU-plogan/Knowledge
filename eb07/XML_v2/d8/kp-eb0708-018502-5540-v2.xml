                    an eminent English poet, was born at Harshull, in the parish of Atherston, in
                    1563, and was descended of an ancient family in Warwickshire. His propensity to
                    poetry showed itself even from his infancy; and we find that his principal poems
                    had been published, and he himself distinguished as a poet, by the time he had
                    attained about thirty years of age. It appears from his poem of Moses’s Birth
                    and Miracles, that he was a spectator at Dover of the Spanish Armada; and it is
                    not improbable that he was there engaged in some military employment. It is
                    certain, indeed, that, owing both to his merit as a writer and to his valuable
                    qualities as a man, he was held in high estimation, and warmly patronized by
                    several personages of consequence, particularly by Sir Henry Goodere, Sir Walter
                    Aston, and the Countess of Bedford, to the first of whom he owns himself
                    indebted for the greater part of his education, whilst by the second he was for
                    many years supported. Amongst his poems the most celebrated is the <hi
                        rend="italic">Poly-Oll)ion,</hi> a chorographical description of England,
                    with its productions^ antiquities, and curiosities, in dodeca-syllabic verse.
                    This he dedicated to Prince Henry, by whose encouragement it was written; and
                    whatever may be thought of the poetry, his descriptions are allowed to be exact.
                    In 1626 we find him styled poet-laureat in a copy of verses written in
                    commendation of Abraham Holland; but as Ben Jonson then held that office, it is
                    to be <pb break="no" facs="nls:193325553?mode=fullsize"

                    commendation; and, in fact, it was bestowed on others as well as Drayton,
                    without being confined strictly to the office commonly known by that
                    appellation. He died in 1631; and was buried amongst the poets in Westminster
                    Abbey, where his bust is still to be seen, with an epitaph penned by Ben
                    Jonson.</p>
