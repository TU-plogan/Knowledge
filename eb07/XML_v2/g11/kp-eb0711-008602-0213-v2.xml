                    excellent English mathematician and astronomer, was born in Hertfordshire in
                    1581, and studied at Westminster-school, whence he removed to Oxford, where he
                    took the degree of master of arts in 1606, and afterwards entered into holy
                    orders. In 1615 he took the degree of bachelor of divinity; but being peculiarly
                    eminent for his knowledge in the mathematics, he had two years before been
                    chosen professor of astronomy in Gresham College, London, where he distinguished
                    himself by his lectures and writings. He invented a small portable quadrant; and
                    also the line of proportions which, after the inventor, is called <hi
                        rend="italic">Gunter's scale.</hi> He likewise published <hi rend="italic"

                        >;</hi> and a work on the sector, cross-staff, and other instruments. This
                    last was published, with an English translation of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Canon</hi><hi rend="italic">Triangulorum,</hi> in 4to, by Samuel Foster,
                    professor of Gresham College. Mr Gunter died at that college in 1626.</p>

                    logarithmic line, usually graduated upon scales, sectors, and the like. It is
                    also called the <hi rend="italic">line of lines</hi> and <hi rend="italic">line

                    upon a ruler, which therefore serves to solve problems instrumentally in the
                    same manner as logarithms do arithmetically. It is usually divided into 100
                    parts, every tenth of which is numbered, beginning with 1 and ending with 10; so
                    that if the first great division, marked 1, stand for one tenth of any integer,
                    the next division, marked two, will stand for two tenths, 3 for three tenths,
                    and so on; and the intermediate divisions will in like manner represent
                    hundredth parts of the same integer. If each of the great divisions represent 10
                    integers, then will the lesser divisions stand for integers; and if the greater
                    divisions be supposed to be each 100, the subdivisions will be each 10.</p>
