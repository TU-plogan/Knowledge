                    1417; but as he owns that the first time he ever saw them was in 1529, it is
                    probably an error of the press for 1517; especially as other historians inform
                    us,thatwhen Sultan Selim conquered Egypt intheyear 1517, several of the natives
                    refused to submit to the Turkish yoke, and revolted under one Zinganeus, whence
                    the Turks call them Zinganees; but being at length surrounded and banished, they
                    agreed to disperse in small parties all over the world, where their supposed
                    skill in the black art gave them an universal reception in that age of
                    superstition and credulity. In the space of a very few years they gained such a
                    number of idle proselytes (who imitated their language and complexion, and
                    betook themselves to the same arts of chiromancy, begging, and pilfering), that
                    they became troublesome, and even formidable, to most of the states of Europe.
                    Hence they were expelled from France in the year 1560, and from Spain in the
                    year 1591. But the government of England took the alarm much earlier; for in
                    1530 they are described by statute 22 Henry VIH. c. 10, as “an outlandish people
                    calling themselves Egyptians, using no craft nor feat of merchandise, who have
                    come into this realm, and gone from shire to shire, and place to place, in great
                    companies, and used great, subtle, and crafty means to deceive the people;
                    bearing them in hand that they by palmistry could tell men’s and women’s
                    fortunes; and so many times by craft and subtility have deceived the people of
                    their money, and also have committed many heinous felonies and robberies.” They
                    are, therefore, directed to avoid the realm, and not to return under pain of
                    imprisonment, and forfeiture of their goods and chattels; and it is further
                    declared, that upon their trials for any felony which they may have committed,
                    they shall not be entitled to a jury <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >medietate</hi><hi rend="italic">linguoe.</hi> And afterwards it was
                    enacted, by statutes 1st and 2d Philip and Mary, c. 4, and 5th Eliz. c. 20, that
                    if any such persons shall be imported into the kingdom, the importer shall
                    forfeit L.40. And if the Egyptians themselves remain one month in the kingdom,
                    or if any person being fourteen years old, whether natural-born subject or
                    stranger, who has been seen or found in the fellowship of such Egyptians, or
                    having disguised him or herself like them, shall remain in the same one month at
                    one or several times, it is felony without benefit of clergy. And Sir Mathew
                    Hale informs us, that at one Suffolk assizes no less than thirteen persons were
                    executed upon these statutes a few years before the restoration. But, to the
                    honour of our national humanity, there are no instances more modern than this of
                    carrying these laws into practice; and the last sanguinary act itself was
                    repealed by 23 Geo. HI. c. 54.</p>
                <p part="N">In Scotland they seem to have enjoyed some share of indulgence; for a
                    writ of privy seal, dated in 1594, supports John Faw, lord and carl of Little
                    Egypt, in the execution of justice on his company and folk, conform to the laws
                    of Egypt, and in punishing certain persons therein named who had rebelled,
                    robbed him, absconded, and refused to return home. James’s subjects are
                    commanded to assist in apprehending the fugitives, and in assisting Faw and his
                    adherents to return home. There is another writ in his favour from Mary queen of
                    Scots, 1553, and in 1554 he obtained a pardon for the murder of Nunan Small; so
                    that it appears he had remained long in Scotland, and perhaps spent some time in
                    England. From him this kind of strolling people received the name of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Faw Gang,</hi> which they still retain among the common
                    people.</p>
                <p part="N">A very circumstantial account of this singular race has been given in a
                    German treatise by Grellman, which has been translated into English by Mr Raper,
                    and published in a quarto volume. It is incredible to think how this regular
                    swarm of banditti has spread itself over the face of the earth. They wander
                    about in Asia, and in the interior parts of Africa, and have overrun most of the
                    European nations. In the reigns of Henry VIII. and Queen Elizabeth, they were
                    set up as a mark of general persecution in England; yet their numbers do not
                    appear to have much diminished in consequence. They are scattered, though not in
                    great numbers, throughout Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Russia; but their chief
                    population is in the south-east parts of Europe. For nearly four centuries they
                    have wandered through the world; and in every region, and amongst every people,
                    whether barbarous or civilized, they have continued equally unchanged by the
                    lapse of time, the variety of climate, or the force of example. Their singular
                    physiognomy and particular manners are the same in every country. Their swarthy
                    complexion receives no darker shade from the burning sun of Africa, nor any
                    fairer tincture from the temperate climes of Europe; they contract no additional
                    laziness in Spain, nor acquire any new industry<pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193640369?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0369-0098"/> in
                    England; in Turkey they behold the mosque and the crescent with the same
                    indifference as they do the Catholic and the Reformed church in Europe. In the
                    neighbourhood of civilized life they continue barbarous; and, beholding around
                    them cities and settled inhabitants, they live in tents or holes in the earth,
                    and wander from place to place as fugitives and vagabonds.</p>
                <p part="N">They are passionately fond of ornaments, in which however they consult
                    neither propriety nor consistency; for they will wear an old laced coat, whilst
                    the rest of their garments scarcely hang together. In Hungary and Transylvania
                    their summer habitations are tents; their winter residences holes dug ten or
                    twelve feet deep in the earth, except such as keep inns or exercise trades. They
                    are fond of plate, particularly silver cups, which they bury under the hearth
                    for security. Their principal occupations are, smith’s-work, or tinkering,
                    wooden ware, and horse-dealing; and in Hungary and Transylvania they are
                    executioners of criminals, flayers of dead beasts, and washers of gold. The
                    women deal in old clothes, prostitution, wanton dances, and fortune-telling.
                    Notwithstanding these occupations, the majority of this people are lazy,
                    beggars, and thieves. They bring up their children to their own professions, and
                    are very fond of them.</p>
                <p part="N">The gypsies have, at least in T ransylvania, a sort of regular
                    government, rather nominal than real or effective. They have their leaders of
                    chiefs, whom they distinguish by the Sclavonian title <hi rend="italic"
                        >waywode.</hi> To this dignity every person is eligible who is of a family
                    descended from a former waywode; but the preference is generally given to those
                    who have the best clothes and the most wealth, or who are of a large stature,
                    and not past the meridian of life. Of religion, however, they have no sense;
                    though, with their usual cunning and hypocrisy, they profess the established
                    faith of every country in which they live. They also speak the languages of the
                    respective countries, yet have a language of their own, though whence derived
                    authors are by no means agreed. It seems to be a sort of linguafranca, formed
                    out of fragments and corruptions of many tongues. The only science which they
                    have attained is music. Their poetry is ungrammatical and indecent rhyme.</p>
                <p part="N">The origin of this people, as we have seen, has been generally believed
                    to be Egyptian; and that belief is as old as their existence in Europe. This
                    theory, however, according to Grellman, is without foundation. The Egyptian
                    descent of these people, he thinks, is not only destitute of proofs, but the
                    most positive evidence is found to contradict it. Their language differs
                    entirely from the Coptic; and their customs are very different from those of the
                    Egyptians. They are indeed to be found in Egypt; but they wander about there as
                    strangers, and form a distinct people, as in other countries. The expressions of
                    Bellonius are strong and decisive: “No part of the world, I believe, is free
                    from those banditti, wandering about in troops, whom we by mistake call <hi
                        rend="italic">Egyptians</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bohemians.</hi> When we
                    were at Cairo, and in the villages bordering on the Nile, we found troops of
                    these strolling thieves sitting under palm trees; and they are esteemed
                    foreigners in Egypt as well as among us.”</p>
                <p part="N">The Egyptian descent of the gypsies being rejected, our author next
                    endeavours to show that they came originally from Hindustan. The same opinion is
                    maintained by Mr Marsden, in a paper on this subject in the seventh volume of
                    the <hi rend="italic">AτchceoU)gia.</hi> Mr Grellman does not insist on the
                    similarity of colour between the two people, nor on the cowardice common to
                    both, nor on the attachment of the Indians to tents, or letting their children
                    go naked, all these being traits to be met with in other nations; but he dwells
                    on the word <hi rend="italic">Polgar,</hi> the name of one of the first gyP <hi
                        rend="superscript"> s</hi> y leaders, and of the Hindustanee god of
                    marriage; also on the correspondence between the travelling smiths among the two
                    people, who carry two pairs of bellows, the Indian’s boy blowing them in India,
                    the wife or child of the gypsy.in Europe; as if every travelling tinker, in
                    every nation where tinkers travel, had not the same journeymen. In lascivious
                    dances and chiromancy the two people agree; nor are these uncommon in other
                    parts of the globe. The excessive loquacity of both is produced as another
                    coincidence; as if no other nations in the world were loquacious. The fainter
                    resemblances are, a fondness for saffron, and the intermarrying only with their
                    own people. The last position in the author’s theory is, that the gypsies are of
                    the lowest class of Indians, namely, <hi rend="italic">Pariahs,</hi> or, as they
                    are called in Hindustan, <hi rend="italic">Sudras.</hi> He compares the manners
                    of this class with those of the gypsies, and enumerates many circumstances in
                    which they agree; but some of the comparisons are frivolous, and prove
                    nothing.</p>
                <p part="N">The objections, however, to which this learned author’s theory is
                    liable, are such as only show that it is not conclusive, but do not prove that
                    it is wrong. It may possibly be right; and upon this supposition the cause of
                    their emigration from their country, he conjectures, not without probability,
                    may have been the war of Timour Beg in India. In the years 1408 and 1409 this
                    conqueror ravaged India; and the progress of his arms was attended with horrid
                    devastation and cruelty. All who offered resistance were destroyed; and those
                    who fell into the enemy’s hands were made slaves, of whom, however, one hundred
                    thousand were put to death. As on this occasion an universal panic took place,
                    what could be more natural than that a great number of terrified inhabitants
                    should endeavour to save themselves by flight? In the last place, the author
                    endeavours to trace the route by which the gypsies came from Hindustan to
                    Europe; but here he franκly acknowledges that all that can be said on the
                    subject is mere surmise.</p>
