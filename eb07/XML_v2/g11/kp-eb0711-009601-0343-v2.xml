                    famous in antiquity. The word is formed from the Greek, <hi rend="italic"
                        >γ&gt;μvο6οφusτrις,</hi> a sophist or philosopher who goes naked.</p>
                <p part="N">This name was applied to the Indian philosophers, whom the excessive
                    heat of the country obliged to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> naked; as that of <hi
                        rend="italic">Peripatetics</hi> was given to those who philosophised
                    walking. The Gymnosophists, however, did not go absolutely naked, but only
                    clothed themselves no further than modesty required. There were some of these
                    sages in Africa; but the most celebrated were those of India. The African
                    Gymnosophists dwelt upon a mountain in Ethiopia, near the Nile, and did not form
                    themselves into societies, like those of India; but each had his private recess,
                    where he studied and performed his devotions by himself. If any person had by
                    chance killed another, he applied to these sages for absolution, and submitted
                    to whatever penances they enjoined. They observed an extraordinary frugality,
                    and lived only upon the fruits of the earth. Lucan ascribes to these
                    Gymnosophists several new discoveries in astronomy.</p>
                <p part="N">As to the Indian Gymnosophists, they dwelt in die woods, where they
                    lived upon the wild products of the earth, and never either drank wine or
                    married. Some of them practised <pb break="no"

                    travelled from one place to another, and were particularly famous for their
                    remedies against barrenness. Others pretended to practise magic, and to foretell
                    future events.</p>
                <p part="N">In general, however, the Gymnosophists were wise and learned men; for
                    their maxims and discourses, recorded by historians, do not in the least savour
                    of a barbarous education, but are plainly the result of great sense and deep
                    thought. They kept up the dignity of their character to such a degree, that they
                    never waited upon any one, not even upon princes. They believed the immortality
                    and transmigration of the soul; they placed the chief happiness of man in a
                    contempt of the goods of fortune and of the pleasures of sense; and they gloried
                    in having given faithful and disinterested counsels to princes and magistrates.
                    It is said, that when they became old and infirm, they threw themselves into a
                    pile of burning wood, in order to prevent the miseries of advanced age. One of
                    them, named Calanus, burned himself in the presence of Alexander the Great.</p>
                <p part="N">Apuleius thus describes the Gymnosophists: “They are all devoted to the
                    study of wisdom, both the older masters and the younger pupils; and what to me
                    appears the most amiable thing in their character is, that they have an aversion
                    to idleness and indolence. Accordingly, as soon as the table is spread, before a
                    bit of victuals be brought, the youths are called together from their several
                    places and offices, and the masters examine them what good they have Ione since
                    the sunrise. Here one relates something he has iiscovered by meditation; another
                    has learned something ay demonstration; and as for those who have nothing to
                    fliege why they should dine, they are turned out to work Pasting.”</p>
