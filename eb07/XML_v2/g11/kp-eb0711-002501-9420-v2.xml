                        >Francisco</hi></label>, a celebrated Italian historian, was born at
                    Florence in 1482, being descended of a family which still subsists in that city.
                    His ancestors had held the most distinguished offices in the Florentine
                    republic. Simon Zanuccio Guicciardini was gonfalonier of justice in 1302; his
                    grandfather, an able politician and a great warrior, beat the Genoese near
                    Sarzano in 1412, and defeated the troops of Sixtus IV. in 1478; and Pietro, the
                    father of the historian, acquired a great reputation by his talents for the
                    conduct of public affairs. Francisco Guicciardini was originally intended for
                    the bar, to which he was at length called; and so great was his success that, at
                    the age of twenty-three, he became professor of jurisprudence, at a time when
                    all the chairs in Italy were occupied by the ablest jurisconsults. Although he
                    had not yet attained the age required by the law, he was appointed ambassador to
                    Ferdinand the Catholic; and having succeeded in gaining the favour of that
                    prince, he thus secured a powerful protector to the Florentine republic. Pope
                    Leo X., a discriminating judge of real merit, called Guicciardini to his court,
                    loaded him with honours, and named him governor of Modena and Reggio, at the
                    same time conferring on him unlimited powers. In this capacity he also served
                    under the pontificate of Adrian VI.; nor did his firmness, his beneficence, and
                    his equity, fail to secure him the attachment of the people over whom he had
                    been placed. But as Romagna was dreadfully distracted by the irreconcilable
                    factions of the Guelphs and Ghibelins, <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193639433?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-9433-0026"/>Clement
                    VII. on succeeding to Adrian VI. sent thither Guicciardini, who in a little time
                    re-established tranquillity in that unhappy country, caused the most rigid
                    justice to be enforced, founded useful establishments, opened new roads, and
                    ultimately rendered himself the idol of all parties. Being afterwards appointed
                    lieutenant-general to the Holy See, he acquired much glory by his defence of
                    Parma, when besieged by the French; and after the death of John of Medieis, the
                    Florentine republie ehose him to succeed that famous captain in the command of
                    the black bands, the <hi rend="italic">elite</hi> of the Italian troops. But, as
                    Clement VII. required a man of tried ability and courage, he obtained the
                    consent of the Florentines to retain Guicciardini some time longer in his
                    service. The city of Bologna was about to escape from the domination of Rome;
                    the senate had raised the standard of revolt; the great family of the Pepoli
                    openly aspired to the supreme power; the vindictive passions were indulged
                    without restraint, and assassinations multiplied. Guicciardini, in the capacity
                    of governor, presented himself in this eity, whither his renown had preceded
                    him. His severe deportment, his activity, his eloquence, tranquillised the
                    people, disarmed the senate, and deprived the Pepoli of all hope of obtaining
                    the objeet they had in view. By his talents, prudence, firmness, and justice,
                    Bologna, which would otherwise have been lost for ever, was saved to the
                    patrimony of St Peter. After this expedition, Guicciardini, notwithstanding the
                    entreaties of Clement, returned to his own country, where he lived in
                    retirement, being wholly occupied with the composition of his history, which he
                    commenced about the end of 1534. But this did not prevent him from rendering the
                    most important services to Florence. His counsels moderated the prodigality and
                    ambition of Alexander of Medieis; and, at the suggestion of Naples, he effected
                    an advantageous arrangement between this pι <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> inee
                    and Charles V. Alexander having been assassinated in 1536 by one of his near
                    relatives, Lorenzino de’ Medieis, Cardinal Cibo immediately assembled the
                    eouneil, when it appeared that all the other members were inclined for a
                    republican government. But Guieeiardini perceiving that by this means the
                    country would become a prey to civil war, declared in favour of a monarchical
                    government; and as his persuasive eloquence at length overcame the predilections
                    of the council, Cosmo de’ Medieis was proclaimed sovereign of Florence. From
                    this moment, Guicciardini took no further concern in public affairs; and after
                    having passed four years in study and retirement, he died in May 1540.</p>
                <p part="N">The memory of this able and excellent person is endeared to men of
                    letters by his <hi rend="italic">History of Italy,</hi> Florence, 1561, in
                    folio, or two vols, in 8vo. The original edition, though much sought after, is
                    incomplete; that of Veniee, 1567, in 4to, is augmented by four books, viz. from
                    seventeen to twenty inclusive; and that of Venice, 1738, in two vols, folio,
                    has, besides, a life of the author by Manni, with a fragment containing some
                    passages previously inedited. But the best and most complete edition is that of
                    Friburg in Brisgau (Florence), 1775, 1776, in four vols. 4to, printed from an
                    autograph manuscript in the Maglia-beechi library, under the auspiees and eare
                    of the eanon Bonso Pio Bonsi, who has supplied the defects of former editions,
                    and otherwise discharged his editorial duties with fidelity and talent. The <hi
                        rend="italic">History of Italy</hi> commences in 1490, and terminates in the
                    month of October 1534. It consists of twenty books, sixteen of whieh are, in the
                    opinion of the best eritics, of superior merit; but the last four are little
                    more than draughts of memoirs, death having prevented the author from bestowing
                    on them all the care and attention which the subject required. The historian
                    commences by giving an exposition of the tranquil condition of Italy before the
                    breaking out of the troubles which desolated its finest provinces. He then
                    proceeds to describe the bloody wars which the French carried on in that
                    country, under three successive kings. By these the face of Italy was almost
                    entirely changed; the popes aggrandised themselves by the ruin of several petty
                    states; Naples and Milan, torn from their respective princes, recognised the
                    domination of Charles V.; and Genoa, which had thrown itself into the arms of
                    Franee, recovered its liberty under the protection of the same monarch, who, on
                    the other hand, gave a sovereign to the republie of Florence. If, in this
                    revolution, the greater part of the princes of Italy maintained themselves, they
                    owed their preservation to their own weakness, and a timely submission to a
                    conqueror, whom fortune seemed to lead on, by rapid strides, towards universal
                    monarchy. Sueh, in a few words, is the grand spectacle presented by the <hi
                        rend="italic">History of the Wars in Italy,</hi> a production whieh has
                    immortalised the name of Guicciardini. The hatred of viee, which breaks out in
                    every page of his work, satisfies the reader as to the probity of' the
                    historian, who was, moreover, concerned in most of the events whieh he relates,
                    and performed a brilliant part both in the cabinet and in the field. His style,
                    sometimes nervous and sublime, sometimes lively and rapid, always noble,
                    perspicuous, and appropriate to the subject, fixes the attention and hurries
                    along the mind of the reader. His reflections, equally judicious and profound,
                    show the wise republican, the able politician, the enlightened philosopher; as
                    the friend of humanity and justice, he unsparingly attacks the abuses of the
                    sovereign power, and vindicates that virtue which the great so often profane for
                    the gratification of their interests and passions. He has left us faithful
                    portraits of the celebrated men of his time; he has represented with equal
                    genius and accuracy the foree and manners of the nations which figure in his
                    history; and he has made us acquainted with the real interests of the princes of
                    his time, as well as with the origin of those jealousies whieh then divided the
                    powers of Europe. Guicciardini has been reproached with the length of the
                    harangues which he puts into the mouths of his characters; but these he has
                    enriched with so much eloquence, with thoughts so new and profound, with images
                    so just and striking, that they are always interesting, and never felt as
                    impeding the progress of his narrative. He has also been accused of prejudice
                    against the French; yet he never exaggerates their losses in battle, and Father
                    Daniel, in his history, has merely copied the narrative of Guieeiardini. If the
                    latter, like several French authors, has traeed an unfavourable portrait of
                    Charles VI1I., he has, on the other hand, done ample justice to the equity and
                    the virtues of Louis X1I., the valour and prudence of La Tremouille, and the
                    brilliant qualities of Gaston de Foix and Francis I.; whilst, in speaking of the
                    Italian and French militia, he always declares in favour of the latter. These,
                    and other facts of a similar description, which might easily be produced or
                    referred to, are sufficient to show that the eharge of partiality is groundless,
                    and that what has been mistaken for prejudice is nothing but the severity of
                    truth. Guieeiardini is also the author of <hi rend="italic">Advice and Counsel

                    remained a long time at Antwerp, where he obtained the favour of the Duke of
