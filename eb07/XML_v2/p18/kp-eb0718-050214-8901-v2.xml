                    kingdom of Bohemia. It is nearly in the centre of the kingdom, on the river
                    Moldau, which runs to the Elbe on its way to the ocean, and divides the city
                    into two parts. There is over the river one of the finest ancient bridges in
                    Europe, 1800 feet in length, consisting of sixteen arches, and adorned with
                    twenty-eight statues of saints and martyrs.</p>
                <p part="N">The city is built on seven hills, and the streets are consequently
                    irregular; the houses are very antique and large, and the compass of the whole
                    is said to be nine miles. It <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538914?mode=fullsize"

                    others the metropolitan cathedral, dedicated to St. Beit, with twelve
                    highly-decorated side chapels, besides which, are no less than forty-six other
                    Catholic churches, and several monasteries and nunneries. The palace of the
                    ancient kings of Bohemia has been converted into a citadel; but a more modern
                    one, now used as a Stadthouse, is of vast extent, containing 150 apartments,
                    with a hall near equal in size to that of Westminster. There is a university,
                    one of the oldest in Germany, in which degrees are obtained in the four
                    faculties of law, medicine, theology, and philosophy. It has connected with it a
                    library of 100,000 volumes; a botanic garden, an astronomical observatory, and
                    collections of natural history. There are forty-four professors, and the
                    students, which were in 1816, only 8798, had increased, and in 1823, were 1348.
                    This seminary may be considered the birthplace of the reformation of religion,
                    as John Huss and Jerome exercised in it the right of free inquiry, and became
                    victims to it nearly one hundred years before the appearance of Luther. There
                    are also several societies for the promotion of learning, of the sciences, and
                    of the fine arts. The institutions for the maintenance of the poor, for
                    affording medical aid, and for other benevolent purposes, are numerous and well
                    conducted. The inhabitants, like those of all Europe, have greatly increased
                    since the treaty of Vienna in 1815. In that year they were 67,730 Christians,
                    and 6,783 Jews; in 1817, they were 79,606, from which, by regular increase, they
                    had grown up, in 1827, to 107,325.</p>
                <p part="N">The chief trade is that which arises from its central position, and from
                    its being the seat of the local government; but there are manufactures of gold,
                    si!ver, jewellery, and other luxuries, as well as others, for internal
                    consumption, of silk, cotton, linen, and woollen goods, and for cutlery and
                    haberdashery wares; there are also large breweries and distilleries. The city is
                    fortified; but, from being commanded by hills, is scarcely defensible; but it
                    has been the theatre of many bloody actions. A battle λvas fought in 1620 on the
                    white plains a few miles from the city, between the Elector Palatine and the
                    Austrians, when the success of the latter caused the independence of Bohemia to
                    expire. It was besieged by the French in 1751, and by the Prussians, who
                    bombarded it in 1757; but in both cases the resistance was attended with
                    success. Lat. 50. 5∙ 33. Long. 14. 49. 40.</p>
