                    afterwards he went to Constantinople, where he prosecuted his studies of the
                    eastern tongues, and procured many valuable manuscripts. After a residence of
                    nearly four years in that city, he embarked in 1640; and taking Paris in his
                    way, visited Gabriel Sionita the famous Maronite, and also Hugo Grotius. In 1643
                    he was presented to the rectory of Childrey, in Berkshire; and about three years
                    afterwards married the daughter of Mr Thomas Burdett. About the middle of 1647
                    he obtained the restitution of the salary of his Arabic Lecture, which had been
                    detained from him about three years. In 1648, Charles I., being then prisoner in
                    the Isle of Wight, nominated Mr Pococke to the professorship of Hebrew, and the
                    canonry of Christ-Church annexed to it; but in 1650 he was ejected from his
                    canonry for refusing to take the engagement, and soon afterwards a vote passed
                    for depriving him of his Hebrew and Arabic professorships. But several governors
                    of houses, and others, having presented a petition in his favour, he was
                    suffered to enjoy both these places. He had some years before published his <hi
                        rend="italic">Specimen Historiae</hi><hi rend="italic">Arabum,</hi> a very
                    learned work, and now appeared his <hi rend="italic">Porta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Mosis;</hi> an'd soon afterwards the English Polyglot edition of the Bible,
                    to which he had largely contributed, and also Eutychius’s Annals, with a Latin
                    version, gave evidence of his industry and learning. At the Restoration he was
                    reinstated in the canonry of Christ-Church, and also received the degree of
                    doctor of divinity. He then published his Arabic version of Grotius’s Treatise
                    of the Truth of the Christian Religion; and an Arabic poem entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Lamiato l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Ajαm</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">Carmen Abu-Ismaelis Tograi,</hi> with a Latin translation and
                    notes. Soon afterwards he published Gregory Abulfaragius’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Dynastiarum;</hi> but this work did not meet
                    with much encouragement from the public, a circumstance which his biographer
                    accounts for in a manner not very creditable to the reign, of Charles II. as
                    compared with the protectorate, when solid learning was appreciated and
                    rewarded. The fact seems to be, that the love of Arabic learning was now growing
                    cold; and Pococke himself, in his correspondence with Mr Thomas Greaves, appears
                    to be not only sensible that such was the case, but very much hurt by the
                    decline of sound literary taste. The same circumstance also may in some measure
                    account for this distinguished scholar not having obtained higher preferment at
                    the period of the Restoration, when such numbers of vacant dignities were
                    conferred on far inferior men. Perhaps he was almost the only instance of a
                    clergyman, then at the highest pitch of eminence for learning, and every other
                    merit proper to his profession, who lived throughout the reign of Charles II.
                    without the least regard from the court, except the favour sometimes done him of
                    being called-upon to translate Arabic letters from the princes of the Levant, or
                    the credentials of ambassadors coming from thence; a service for which we do not
                    find that he obtained any recompense, besides fair words and hollow compliments.
                    But his modesty equalled his merit; and after presenting Abulfaragius to the
                    king, he ceased to obtrude his claims on the attention of royalty. In 1674 he
                    published an Arabic version of the principal parts of the Liturgy of the Church
                    of England; and a few years afterwards appeared his Commentary on the Prophecies
                    of Micah, Malachi, Hosea, and Joel. This truly great man died in 1691, after
                    having been fol* many years confessedly <pb break="no"

                    orientalist in Europe; and he was no less worthy of admiration for his uncommon
                    modesty and humility, and all the virtues which can adorn a Christian. His
                    theological works were republished at London in 1740, in two volumes folio.</p>

                    distantly related to the preceding, was the son of Mr Richard Pococke, head
                    master of the free-school at Southampton, where he was born in the year 1704. He
                    received his school-learning under his father, and his academical education at
                    Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he took his various degrees. He commenced
                    his travels in the East in 1737, and returned in 1742. In 1743, be published his
                    Observations on Egypt, under the general title of a Description of the East and
                    some other Countries. In 1744, he was made precentor of Waterford; and in 1745,
                    he printed the second volume of his Travels, under the title of Observations on
                    Palestine or the Holy Land, Syria, Mesopotamia, Cyprus, and Candia, which he
                    dedicated to the Earl of Chesterfield, then lord-lieutenant of Ireland, whom he
                    attended in the capacity of domestic chaplain. In 1756, Dr Pococke was promoted
                    to the bishopric of Ossory, vacant by the death of Dr Edward Maurice; in July
                    1765, hc was translated to the see of Meath, which had been originally intended
                    for the Bishop of Elphin, who, however, declined taking out his patent; and he
                    died suddenly in September following, having been carried off by apoplexy,
                    whilst engaged in visiting his diocese. As a traveller Dr Pococke was equally
                    distinguished for research, learning, and accuracy, to which ample justice has
                    indeed been done by Jablonski, in the preface to part third of his <hi
                        rend="italic">Pantheon AEgyptiorum.</hi> He penetrated no farther up the
                    Nile than the island of Philae, called by the Arabs the Temple Island; whereas
                    Norden, in 1737, proceeded as far as Derré, between the first and second
                    cataract. The two travellers are supposed to have met on the Nile, in the
                    neighbourhood of Esneh, in January 1738; but, according to another account, they
                    passed in the night without recognition.</p>
                <p part="N">Bishop Pococke visited other parts besides the East, and described some
                    remarkable objects both in Scotland and Ireland. According to Cumberland, he was
                    a man of mild but peculiar manners, and of primitive simplicity. “Having given
                    the world,” says this writer, “a full detail of his researches in Egypt, he
                    seemed to hold himself excused from saying anything more about them, and
                    observed, in general, an obdurate taciturnity. In his carriage and deportment he
                    appeared to have contracted something of the Arab character; yet there was no
                    austerity in his silence, and though his air was solemn, his temper was serene.”
                    Cumberland adds: “When we were on our road to Ireland, I saw from the windows of
                    the inn at Daventry a cavalcade of horsemen approaching on a gentle trot, headed
                    by an elderly chief in clerical attire, who was followed by five servants at
                    distances geometrically measured and most precisely maintained, and who, upon
                    entering the inn, proved to be this distinguished prelate conducting his horde
                    with the phlegmatic patience of a scheik.” Cumberland’s delineation, however,
                    must be received with some caution, particularly in the latter part, which bears
                    evident marks of exaggeration.</p>
