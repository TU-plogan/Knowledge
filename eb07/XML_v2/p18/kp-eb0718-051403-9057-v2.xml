                    arrangement by that Supreme Power which presides over nature, has always been a
                    favourite opinion amongst the vulgar, and has also been believed by many
                    speculative men. Thus, in that beautiful scene in the sixth book of the Iliad,
                    Hector, taking leave of his wife and child, speaks thus:</p>
                <p part="N">Andromache, my soul’s far better part, Why with untimely sorrows heaves
                    thy heart? No hostile hand can antedate my doom, Till fate condemns me to the
                    silent tomb.</p>
                <p part="N">Fix’d is the term to all the race of earth, And such the hard condition
                    of our birth. No force can then resist, no flight can save; All sink alike, the
                    fearful and the brave.</p>
                <p part="N">The ancient Stoics, Zeno and Chrysippus, whom the Jewish Essenes seem to
                    have followed, asserted the existence of a Deity, who, acting wisely, but
                    necessarily, contrived the general system of the universe; from which, by a
                    series of causes, whatever is now done in it unavoidably results. This series,
                    or concatenation of causes, they held to be necessary in every part; and thought
                    God himself as so much the servant of necessity, and of his own decrees, that he
                    could not have made the smallest object in the world otherwise than it now is,
                    much less was he able to alter any thing.</p>
                <p part="N">According to the words of Seneca, <hi rend="italic">Eadem

                    unalterable course regulates divine as well as human things. Even he who wrote
                    the Fates, the Maker and Governor of all things, submits to them. He did but
                    once command, but he always obeys.” The stoical fate, however, differs from the
                    Christian predestination in several points. They regarded the divine nature and
                    will as a necessary part of a necessary chain of causes; whereas the Christians
                    consider the Deity as the lord and ruler of the Universe, omnipotent and free,
                    appointing all things according to his pleasure. Being doubtful of the
                    immortality of the soul, the Stoics could have no idea of the doctrine of
                    election and reprobation; nor did they ever doubt their own freedom of will, or
                    power of doing good as well as evil, as we shall presently see the Christian
                    predestinarians have done.</p>
                <p part="N">Mahommed introduced into his Koran the doctrine of an absolute
                    predestination.of the course of human affairs. He represented life and death,
                    prosperity and adversity, with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539070?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0718-9070-0515"/>every event that befalls a man in this world,
                    as the result of a previous determination of the one God who rules over all; and
                    he found this opinion the best engine for inspiring his followers with that
                    contempt of danger, which, united to fanatical zeal, has extended the empire of
                    their faith over the fairest portion of the habitable globe.</p>
                <p part="N">The controversy concerning predestination first made its appearance in
                    the Christian church about the beginning of the fifth century. Pelagius a
                    British, and Coelestius an Irish monk, both lived at Rome during that period,
                    and possessed great celebrity on acconnt of their piety and learning. They
                    taught that the opinion is false, which asserts, that human nature is
                    necessarily corrupted by a depravity derived from our first parents. They
                    contended, that men are born at present in a state as pure as that in which Adam
                    was originally created; and that they are not less qualified than he was for
                    fulfiling all righteousness, and for reaching the most sublime eminence of piety
                    and virtue. They maintained that the external grace of God, which is given unto
                    all, and attends the preaching of the gospel, is necessary to call forth the
                    attention and the exertions of men; but that we do not want the assistance of
                    any internal grace to purify the heart, and to give it the first impulse towards
                    what is good. Having fled into Africa on account of the Goths, who at that time
                    (A. D. 410,) invaded Italy, Coelestius remained at Carthage as a presbyter; but
                    Pelagius went into the East, where he settled, and prospered under the patronage
                    of John bishop of Jerusalem, to whom his sentiments were agreeable. On the
                    contrary, the celebrated Augustin, bishop of Hippo, strenuously asserted the
                    depravity of human nature since the fall of the first man; the necessity of a
                    special interposition of divine grace to enable us to do any one good action;
                    and consequently, that none could obtain salvation excepting those whom God has
                    thought fit to elect, and upon whom he bestows this grace. The dispute was
                    carried on with great zeal. Zozimus, bishop of Rome, decided at first in favour
                    of Pelagius and Coelestius, whose followers were called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pelagians</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but he aftenvards altered his
                    opinion, and by the activity of Augustin, the council of Ephesus was called, at
                    which the opinion of his antagonists Avas formally condemned.</p>
                <p part="N">In the course of the same century, these opinions assumed a variety of
                    forms and modifications. One party, called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Predestinarians,</hi> carried Augustin’s doctrine fully farther than he
                    himself had ventured to do in express Avords; and asserted, that God had not
                    only predestinated the Avicked to punishment, but that he had also decreed that
                    they should commit those very sins on account of Avhich they are hereafter to be
                    punished. Another party moderated the doctrine of Pelagius, and Avere called <hi
                        rend="italic">Semipelagians.</hi> Their peculiar opinion is expressed in a
                    different manner by different Avriters; but all the accounts sufficiently agree.
                    Thus, some represent them as maintaining that i∏Avard grace is not necessary to
                    the first beginning of repentance, but only to our progress in virtue. Others
                    say, that they acknoAvledged the power of grace, but said that faith depends
                    upon ourselves, and good Avorks upon God; and it is agreed upon all hands, that
                    these Semipelagians held that predestination is made upon the foresight of good
                    Avorks. The assistance of St. Augustin, though then far advanced in life, was
                    called in to combat these tenets, and hc Avrote several treatises upon the
                    subject. In all these he strenuously maintained, that the predestination of the
                    elect Avas independent of any foresight of their good works, but Avas according
                    to the good pleasure of God only; and that perseverance comes from God, and not
                    from man. Thereafter the doctrine of St. Augustin, as he is often called, became
                    general. He Avas the oracle of the schoolmen. They never ventured to dif fer
                    from him in sentiment; they only pretended to dispute about the true sense of
                    his writings.</p>
                <p part="N">Almost the Avhole of the earliest refcrmers maintained these opinions of
                    St. Augustin. They assumed, under Luther, a more regular and systematic form
                    than they had ever formerly exhibited. But as the Lutherans afterwards abandoned
                    them, they are now known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Calviηis-tic
                        Doctrines,</hi> from John Calvin of Geneva. This reformer asserted, that the
                    everlasting condition of mankind in a future world Avas determined from all
                    eternity by the unchangeable decree of the Deity, arising from his sole good
                    pleasure or free will. Being a man of great ability, industry, and eloquence,
                    Geneva, Avhere he taught, and which Avas a free state, soon became the resort of
                    all the men of letters belonging to the reformed churches, and Avas a kind of
                    seminary from which missionaries issued to propagate the Protestant doctrine
                    throughout Europe. Their success Avas such, that, excepting a small part of
                    Germany, the principles of all the reformed churches are professedly Calvinistic
                    or Predestinarian.</p>
                <p part="N">The opponents of the doctrine of predestination amongst the Protestants
                    usually receive the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Arminians</hi> or <hi

                    theology at Leyden. He Avas violently opposed by Gomer his colleague, and died
                    in 1609. After his death, the controversy Avas conducted Avith great eagerness
                    on both sides. The Calvinists, hoAvever, gradually prevailed. A synod Avas
                    called at Dort, in 1618, to which the most celebrated divines of different
                    countries Avere invited. There, in a great measure, by the authority and
                    influence of Maurice prince of Orange, the Arminians Avere condemned as
                    heretics; for by this time ambitious and poAverful men found themselves
                    politically interested in this religious contest. The Arminians presented to
                    this synod a remonstrance, containing a statement of their faith upon the
                    subjects in dispute; and from this they derived the appellation of <hi
                        rend="italic">Remonstrants.</hi> This statement contained the five
                    folloAving articles. 1. That God from all eternity predestinated those to
                    everlasting salvation Avhom he forcsaAv Avould believe in Christ unto the end of
                    their lives, and predestinated obstinate unbelievers to everlasting punishment.
                    2. Jesus Christ died for the Avhole human race, and for every individual of it,
                    but believers alone reap the benefit of his death. 3. No man can produce faith
                    in his mind by his <hi rend="smallcaps">oavπ</hi> free-will, but it is necessary
                    that man, who is by nature Avicked and unfit for acting or thinking aright,
                    should be regenerated by the grace of the Holy Spirit, imparted by God for
                    Christ’s sake. 4. This divine grace constitutes the source, the progress, and
                    the fulfilment, of all that is good in man, but it is not irresistible in its
                    operation. 5. Believers, by the assistance of the Holy Spirit, are abundantly
                    fitted for every good Avork; but Avhether it is possible for those <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">av!io</hi> have once been truly such to fall aAvay, and to
                    perish finally, is not clear, and must be better inquired into by searching the
                    Scriptures.</p>
                <p part="N">In opposition to these, a counter remonstrance was presented, containing
                    the opinions of the Calvinists, Avhich was approved of by the synod. The
                    substance of it was after-Avards adopted, and in nearly the same expressions,
                    into the Confession of Faith compiled by the assembly of divines Avhich met at
                    Westminster, in 1643, and which every clergyman and probationer for the ministry
                    in Scotland is at present required to subscribe previous to his admission. To
                    give as clear and fair an idea as possible to the Calvinistic doctrine upon this
                    head, we transcribe the folloAving passage from that Confession: “God from all
                    eternity did, by the most wise and holy counsel of his own will, freely and
                    unchangeably ordain Avhatsoever comes to pass; yet so, as thereby neither is God
                        <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539083?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0718-9083-0516"/>the author of sin, nor is violence offered to
                    the will of the creatures, nor is the liberty or contingencies of second causes
                    taken away, but rather established. Although God knows whatsoever may or can
                    come to pass upon all supposed conditions; yet hath he not decreed any thing
                    because he foresaw it as future, or that which would come to pass upon such
                    conditions. By the decree of God, for the manifestation of his glory, some men
                    and angels are predestinated unto everlasting life, and others are fore-ordained
                    to everlasting death. These angels and men, thus predestinated and
                    fore-ordained, are particularly and unchangeably designed; and their number is
                    so certain and definite, that it cannot be either increased or diminished. Those
                    of mankind that are predestinated unto life, God, before the foundation of the
                    world was laid, according to his eternal and immutable purpose, and the secret
                    counsel and good pleasure of his will, hath chosen, in Christ, unto everlasting
                    glory, out of his mere free grace and love, without any foresight of faith, or
                    good works, or perseverance in either of them, or any other thing in the
                    creature, as conditions or causes moving him thereunto; and all to the praise of
                    his glorious grace. As God hath appointed the elect unto glory, so hath he, by
                    the eternal and most free purpose of his will, fore-ordained, all the means
                    thereunto. Wherefore, they who are elected, being fallen in Adam, are redeemed
                    by Christ, are effectually called unto faith in Christ, by his spirit working in
                    due season; are justified, adopted, sanctified, and kept, by his power through
                    faith unto salvation. Neither are any other redeemed by Christ effectually
                    called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only. The rest
                    of mankind, God was pleased, according to the unsearchable counsel of his own
                    will, whereby he extendeth or withholdeth mercy as he pleaseth for the glory of
                    his sovereign power over his creatures, to pass by, and to ordain them to
                    dishonour and wrath for their sin, to the praise of his glorious justice.”</p>
                <p part="N">There are two kinds of Calvinists or Predestinarians, viz. the <hi
                        rend="italic">Supralapsarians,</hi> who maintained that God did originally
                    and expressly decree the fall of Adam, as a foundation for the display of his
                    justice and mercy; whilst they who maintain that God <hi rend="italic">oτΛy
                        permitted</hi> the fall of Adam, are called <hi rend="italic"

                    reprobation, being as it were, subsequent to that event. But, as Dr. Priestley
                    justly remarks, if we admit the divine prescience, there is not, in fact, any
                    difference between the two schemes; and accordingly that distinction is now
                    seldom mentioned.</p>
                <p part="N">Nor was the church of Rome less agitated by the contest about
                    predestination than were the first Protestants. The council of Trent was much
                    perplexed how to settle the matter without giving offence to the Dominicans, who
                    were much attached to the doctrine of St. Augustin, and possessed great
                    influence in the council. After much dispute, the main object came to be, how to
                    contrive such a decree as might give offence to nobody, although it should
                    decide nothing. Upon the whole, however, they seem to have favoured the
                    Semipelagian scheme. Amongst other things, it was determined, that good works
                    are of themselves meritorious to eternal life; but it is added, by way of
                    softening, that it is through the goodness of God, that he makes his own gifts
                    tobe merits in us. Catarin revived at that council an opinion of some of the
                    schoolmen, that God chose a small number of persons, such as the blessed virgin,
                    the apostles, and others, whom he was determined to save without any foresight
                    of their good works; and that he also wills that all the rest should be saved,
                    providing for them all necessary means, but they are at liberty to use them or
                    not. This is called the <hi rend="italic">Baxterian</hi> scheme in England, from
                    one of its promoters there. But at all events, the council of Trent seems to
                    have been extremely anxious that any opinions entertained amongst them
                    concerning predestination might have as little influence as possible upon
                    practical morality. “Let no man,” say they, “whilst he remains in this mortal
                    state presume that he is among the number of the elect, and that therefore he
                    cannot sin, or sin without repentance; for it cannot be known who are elected
                    without a special revelation from God.” (Sect. 6. c. 13.)</p>
                <p part="N">The Jesuits at first followed the opinion of St. Augustin; but they
                    afterwards forsook it. Molina, one of their order, was the author of what is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">middle scheme,</hi> or the doctrine of <hi
                        rend="italic">agrace sufficient for all men,</hi> but subject to the freedom
                    of the human will. Jansenius, a doctor of Louvain, opposed the Jesuits with
                    great vigour, and supported the doctrine of St. Augustin. He wrote in a very
                    artful manner, declaring that he did not presume to state his own sentiments
                    upon the subject. He pretended only to explain and publish the sentiments of
                    that great father of the church St. Augustin. But the Jesuits, in consequence of
                    that inviolable submission to the authority of the pope, which they always
                    maintained, had sufficient interest at Rome to procure the opinion of Jansenius
                    to be condemned there; with this addition subjoined, however, that nothing was
                    thereby intended to be done in prejudice of the doctrine of St. Augustin. This
                    produced an absurd dispute about the pope’s infallibility in matters of fact.
                    The Jansenists affirmed, that the pope had made a mistake in condemning the
                    opinions of Jansenius as different from those of St. Augustin; whereas in truth
                    they are the same, and the one cannot be condemned without the other. But the
                    Jesuits affirmed, that the pope is no less infallible in points of fact than he
                    is in questions of faith; and he having decided, that the opinions of Jansenius
                    are different from those of St. Augustin, every good Catholic is bound to
                    believe accordingly that they are different. Some of the very ablest supporters
                    of predestination have appeared amongst the Jansenists, and particularly amongst
                    the gentlemen of Port-Royal.</p>
                <p part="N">With regard to Great Britain, the earliest English reformers were in
                    general Sublapsarians, although some of them were Supralapsarians. But the rigid
                    Predestinarians have been gradually declining in number in that church, although
                    they still subscribe the thirty-nine articles of their faith, which are
                    unquestionably Calvinistic. The celebrated Scotch reformer John Knox having been
                    educated at Geneva, established in this country the doctrine of predestination
                    in its strictest form; and it has probably been adhered to with more strictness
                    in Scotland than in any other country of Europe.</p>
