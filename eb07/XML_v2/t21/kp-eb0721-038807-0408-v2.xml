                <p part="N"><label type="entry">TRIUMPH</label>, a public and solemn honour
                    conferred by the ancient Romans on a victorious general, by allowing him a
                    magnificent entry into the city. The greater triumph, called also <hi
                        rend="italic">curulis,</hi> or simply the triumph, was decreed by the senate
                    to a general, upon the conquering of a province, or gaining a signal victory.
                    The day appointed for the ceremony being arrived, scaffolds were erected in the
                    forum and circus, and all the other parts of the city where they could best
                    behold the pomp. The senate went to meet the conqueror without the gate called
                        <hi rend="italic">Capena</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Triumphalis,</hi> and
                    marched back in order to the Capitol; the ways being cleared and cleansed by a
                    number of officers and tipstaffs, who drove away such as thronged the passage or
                    straggled up and down. The general was clad in a rich purple robe, interwoven
                    with figures of gold, setting forth his great exploits; his buskins were set
                    with pearl; and he wore a crown, which at first was only laurel, but afterwards
                    gold; in one hand he bore a branch of laurel, and in the other a truncheon. He
                    was carried in a magnificent chariot, adorned with ivory and plates of gold,
                    drawn usually by two white horses; though sometimes by other animals, as that of
                    Pompey, when he triumphed over Africa, by elephants, that of Mark Antony by
                    lions, that of Heliogabalus by tigers, that of Aurelian by deer. His children
                    were at bis feet, and sometimes on the chariot horses. The procession was led by
                    the musicians, who played triumphal pieces in praise of the general. These were
                    followed by young men, who led the victims to the sacrifice, with their horns
                    gilded, and their heads adorned with ribbands and garlands. Next came the carts
                    and waggons, loaded with all the spoils taken from the enemy, together with
                    their horses, chariots, &amp;c. These were followed by the kings, princes, and
                    generals, who had been taken captives, loaded with chains. Next appeared the
                    triumphal chariot, before which, as it passed, they all along strewed flowers,
                    and the people with loud acclamations called out <hi rend="italic">Io
                        triumphe!</hi> the chariot was followed by the senate, clad in white robes,
                    and the senate by such citizens as had been set at liberty or ransomed; and the
                    procession was closed by the priests and their officers and utensils, with a
                    white ox led along for the chief victim. In this order they proceeded through
                    the triumphal gate, along the Via Sacra, to the Capitol, where the victims were
                    slain. In the mean time all the temples were open, and all the altars loaded
                    with offerings and incense; games and combats were celebrated in the public
                    places, and the city became a scene of general festivity. The less splendid form
                    of a triumph was called an <hi rend="italic">Ovation;</hi> a term supposed to
                    have been derived from <hi rend="italic">ovis,</hi> because on such an occasion
                    sheep, and not oxen, were usually sacrificed. The procession commonly began at
                    the Albanian Mount, from whence the general with his retinue made his entry into
                    the city. He walked on foot, wearing a garland of myrtle, and was attended by a
                    band of music.</p>
