                    primary sense a cube or die; so called from the Greek word <hi rend="italic"
                        >τέσσαgα,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">τέσσεgα</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                        >four;</hi> respect being had to its number of sides, distinct from the two
                    horizontal planes above and below. And it was thus distinguished from the talus,
                    which being round at each end, contained only four planes or faces on which it
                    could stand; and therefore when thrown it had no more than two side faces in
                    view. Hence <hi rend="italic">ludere talis er ludere tesseris</hi> are spoken of
                    by Roman writers as two different games. The word <hi rend="italic">tessera</hi>
                    was applied to many other things, not so much from a similitude in the figure,
                    as from the relation they bore to some other things of which they were the sign
                    or token; as the points on the upper plane of the die denoted the good or ill
                    success of the cast.</p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">tessera hospitalis</hi> was cither public or
                    private. As to the former, we find among the inscriptions published by Gruter
                    instances of two municipal towns which put themselves under the patronage of the
                    Roman governor; and the reciprocal engagement between them, engraved on two
                    copperplates, of an oblong form, with a pediment at the top, is called in both
                        <hi rend="italic">tessera hospitalis.</hi> The design of it <pb break="no"

                    />was to cultivate or maintain a lasting friendship between private persons and
                    their families, and gave a mutual claim to the contracting parties and their
                    descendants, of a reception and kind treatment at each other’s houses, as
                    occasion offered; for which end those tesserae were so contrived as best to
                    preserve the memory of that transaction to posterity. And one method of doing
                    this was by dividing one of them lengthwise into two equal parts, upon each of
                    which one of the parties wrote his name, and interchanged it with the other.
                    From this custom came the prevailing expression “tesseram hospitalem
                    confringere,” applied to persons who had violated their engagements.</p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">tesserae frumentarioe</hi> were small tallies
                    given by the emperors to the populace at Rome, entitling them to the reception
                    of a quantity of corn from the public at stated seasons. The person who had the
                    inspection of these was called <hi rend="italic">tesserarius.</hi> They were
                    made of wood and of stone. There was another kind of tessera, which entitled
                    persons to a sight of the public games and other diversions, usually made in an
                    oblong form.</p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">tessera militaris</hi> was a signal given by the
                    general or chief commander of an army, as a direction to the soldiers for
                    executing any duty or service required of them. This, upon urgent occasions, was
                    only vocal; but in ordinary cases it was written on a tablet, commonly made of
                    wood. Besides these civil and military tesserae, there are others which relate
                    to religious affairs, and may be called <hi rend="italic">sacred.</hi></p>
