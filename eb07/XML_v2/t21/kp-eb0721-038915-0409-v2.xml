                            >Chevalier's work, written in French, was translated into English, and
                            illustrated with notes, by Professor Dalzel. Edinb. 1791, 4to. It soon
                            afterwards appeared in a German translation, to which Heyne contributed
                            a preface, and other additions: “Beschreibung der Ebene von Troja,” u.
                            s. w. Leipzig, 1792, 8vo. This was followed by “Die Ebene von Troja,
                            noch dem Grafen Choiseul Gouffier, und andern neuern Reisenden; nebat
                            einer Abhandlung des Ilern. Major Müller in Göttingen, und Erläuterungen
                            über den Scliauplats der Ilias, und die darauf vorgefallnen
                            Begebenheiten, von Carl Gotthold Lenz.” Neu-Strelitz, 1798, 8vo. Nor
                            must we here overlook a short but learned dissertation of Spohn, “De
                            Agro Trojano in Carminibus Homericis discripto” Lipsiae, 1814, 8vo. A
                            more recent work on the subject was published by Mr Maclaren: "A
                            Dissertation on the Topography of the Plain of Troy, including an
                            Examination of the Opinions of Demetrius, Chevalier, Dr Clarke, and
                            Major Rennell." Edinb. 1822, 8vo.</p></note> The city of Troy, according
                    to him, stood on the present site of the modern village of Bournabashi, which is
                    situated four leagues from the sea, on the side of an eminence, at the
                    termination of a spacious plain, the soil of which is rich and of a blackish
                    colour. Close to the village is to be seen a marsh covered with tall reeds: and
                    the situation is impregnable on all sides except at Erin (Homer’s <hi
                        rend="italic">ὲgιvεὁς),</hi> the <hi rend="italic">hill of wild
                        fig-trees,</hi> which extended between the Scaean gate and the sources of
                    the Scamander. In the plain there are several conical mounds or barrows, some of
                    them a hundred feet in diameter at the base; and these the author maintains to
                    be the identical tombs raised over the ashes of the heroes of the Trojan war.
                    Since Chevalier’s dissertation appeared, this plain has been investigated by Mr
                    Morritt, Sir William Gell, Dr Clarke, Mr Hobhouse, Mr Acland, and several other
                    travellers and writers. Dr Clarke traversed the ground in different directions
                    seventeen times. He rejects the hypothesis of Chevalier, and, reasoning from the
                    authority of Strabo, and from the site of New Ilium, which he ascertained by
                    inscriptions found among ruins, he fixes the situation of Troy four or five
                    miles to the northward of Bournabashi, near a sluggish rivulet, called Califat
                    Osmack, which he considers to be the Simois. The name of the Scamander is still
                    preserved in the Mender, the most considerable stream in the district, rising in
                    Mount Ida, as described by Homer; and the Thymbrius is still preserved in the
                    Thymbrek. Dr Clarke also finds objects corresponding to the Callicolone, the
                    tomb of Ilus, and the Throsmos or mound of the plain. But very strong objections
                    have been stated to his opinions by Mr Hobhouse and others; and, upon the whole,
                    the more this subject is investigated, the more insuperable difficulties seem to
                    present themselves to any attempt to identify the places and objects alluded to
                    by the poet.</p>

                    most ancient of the different kinds used in Britain. The ounce of this weight
                    was brought from Grand Cairo in Egypt, about the time of the crusades, into

                    natural philosophy; and for comparing different weights with each other.</p>

                        rend="italic">Weight</hi> was established in the year 1618, by James VI.,
                    who enacted that only one weight should be used in Scotland, viz. the French
                    Troy stone of 16 pounds, and 16 ounces in the pound. The pound contains 7600
                    grains, and is equal to 17 oz. 6 dr. avoirdupois. The cwt. or 112 lb.
                    avoirdupois contains only 103 lb. 2½ oz. of this weight, though generally
                    reckoned equal to 104 lb. This weight is nearly, if not exactly, the same as
                    that of Paris and Amsterdam; and is generally known by the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">Dutch weight.</hi> Though prohibited by the articles of union,
                    it continued to be used in weighing iron, hemp, flax, most Dutch and Baltic
                    goods, meal, butcher-meat, pewter and lead, and some other articles. See <hi
