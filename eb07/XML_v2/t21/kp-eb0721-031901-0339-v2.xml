                    twenty-two miles long, and from four to nine miles broad. This island was
                    discovered by Columbus in 1496, and received its name from the herb which was
                    smoked by the inhabitants. Sir Robert Dudley visited it in 1580; and in 1608
                    James I. claimed its sovereignty, though no effectual attempts were then made to
                    colonize it. In 1628 Charles I. made a grant of the isle to the earl of
                    Pembroke; but it continued almost deserted till 1632, when <pb break="no"

                    which they gave the name of New Walcheren; but before they were able thoroughly
                    to establish themselves, they were attacked by the Spaniards of Trinidad, aided
                    by the Indians, and the colony was utterly destroyed. Tobago remained deserted
                    till 1654, when two opulent merchants of Flushing, named Lampsin, again
                    colonized it, and raised it to be one of the most thriving commercial emporiums
                    in the West Indies. About the same time the duke of Courland, to whom James I.
                    had given a grant of the island, carried about a hundred families from Courland,
                    and settled them on one of the most beautiful parts of the island, which was
                    named after the founder. The island experienced various vicissitudes till it was
                    taken by the British in 1793, in whose possession it has continued ever
                    since.</p>
                <p part="N">Tobago consists of a mass of rocks, the highest part of which is towards
                    the north-eastern extremity, where it rises to about 900 feet; it gradually
                    descends towards the south-west, with small and delightful valleys interspersed.
                    It is well cultivated where the rocks are not too steep. It has several good
                    harbours, chiefly on the northern coast. The climate is considered unhealthy,
                    the average mortality of the white troops having been ascertained to be at the
                    rate of fifteen per cent. annually. The principal town is Scarborough, which is
                    situated at the sea-shore, on the south coast.</p>
                <p part="N">By the census of 1835, the population consisted of,—</p>
                <p part="N">Males. Females. Total. Whites 250 30 280</p>
                <p part="N">Free coloured and blacks ... 3,000</p>
                <p part="N">Apprenticed labourers 4,515 5,290 9,805</p>
                <p part="N">13,085</p>
                <p part="N">The experts of Tobago amounted in 1836 to L.196,974, of which L.166,333
                    were for sugar and molasses, and L.29,960 for rum; thus showing that the
                    sugar-cane produces almost the sole exportable commodities of the island. The
                    imports during the same period amounted to L.73,947, consisting chiefly of wood
                    and lumber, fish, corn, and British manufactures.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1836 there were four free schools in the island, with 347 scholars;
                    and four private schools, one of which is connected with the Moravians, and two
                    with the Methodists. The local legislature consists of the lieutenant-governor,
                    a legislative council of nine, and a house of assembly of sixteen members.</p>
