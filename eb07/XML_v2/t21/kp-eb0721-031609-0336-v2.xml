                    latter to enjoy the crown, on condition that he should bring up none of his male
                    issue, by which means the crown should at length revert to him. But Jupiter
                    being spared by the address of Rhea, Saturn’s wife, Titan and his children were
                    so enraged at seeing their hopes frustrated, that they took up arms to revenge
                    the injury; and not only defeated Saturn, but kept him and his wife prisoners
                    till he was delivered by Jupiter, who defeated the Titans; when from the blood
                    of those Titans slain in the battlc, proceeded serpents, scorpions, and all
                    venomous reptiles. Such is the account given by the poets of this family of
                    Grecian and Roman gods. From the fragments of Sanchoniatho, however, and other
                    ancient writers, many learned men have inferred that the Titans were an early
                    race of ambitious heroes, who laid the foundation of that idolatry which quickly
                    overspread the world; and that by assuming the names of the luminaries of
                    heaven, they contrived to get themselves everywhere adored as the <hi
                        rend="italic">Dii major urn gentium.</hi> That the word <hi rend="italic"
                        >Titan</hi> signifies the sun, there can indeed be very little doubt. Every
                    one knows that such was its signification in the AEolic dialect; and as it is
                    evidently compounded of <hi rend="italic">Ti,</hi> which in some oriental
                    tongues signifies <hi rend="italic">bright</hi> or <hi rend="italic">clear,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Tan,</hi> which signifies a <hi rend="italic"
                        >country,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">earth,</hi> it may be safely
                    concluded that <hi rend="italic">Titan</hi> was the name of the sun before the
                    word was imported into Greece. But the great question among antiquaries is, of
                    what country was that race which, assuming to themselves the names of the
                    heavenly bodies, introduced into the world that species of idolatry which is
                    known by the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Hero-worship?</hi> Pezron, in
                    “L’Antiquité des Terns,” maintains that the Titans were a family of Sacae or
                    Scythians, who made their first appearance beyond Media and Mount lmaus, in the
                    upper regions of Asia; that they were the descendants of Gomer the son of
                    Japheth and grandson of Noah; and that after conquering a great part of the
                    world, upon entering Upper Phrygia, they quitted their ancient name of Gomerians
                    or Cimmerians, and assumed that of Titans, All this, he says, happened before
                    the birth of Abraham and the foundation of the Assyrian monarchy; and he avers
                    that Uranus, their second prince in the order of succession, conquered Thrace,
                    Greece, the island of Crete, and a great part of Europe. Uranus was succeeded by
                    Saturn, and Saturn by Jupiter, who flourished, he says, 300 years before Moses,
                    and divided his vast empire between himself, his brother Pluto, and his
                    cousin-german Atlas, who was called Telamon. For the truth of this genealogy of
                    the Titans, Pezron appeals to the most approved Greek historians; but, unluckily
                    for his hypothesis, these writers have not a single sentence by which it can be
                    fairly supported. Others, taking the fragment of Sanchoniatho’s Phoenician
                    History for their guide, have supposed the Titans to have been the descendants
                    of Ham. Of this opinion were Bishop Cumberland and some other writers.</p>
