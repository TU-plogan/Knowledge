                    the Austrian kingdom of Illyria is divided. It forms the most southern part of
                    that kingdom, and comprises the whole of the sea-shore of the dominions of
                    Austria, extending from Grado to Novi; and there have been added portions of
                    Venetian Friaul, both the Istrias, part of Krain, with such portions of the
                    district of Agram as are on the right bank of the river Save, and the Quarnaro
                    islands of Cherso and Veglia, with their dependencies. The government is
                    distributed into four circles, viz. Gorz, Istria (in which is the city of
                    Trieste), Fiume, and Karlstadt. The whole extent of the country is 4972 square
                    miles, and it comprises twenty-nine cities now or once fortified, forty-one
                    markettowns, 1193 villages, 93,493 houses, and 598,970 inhabitants. The
                    population is of various original races, but the rural people are for the most
                    part of the Illyrian nation, and speak only the language of that tribe. They
                    mostly adhere to the Romish church, while in the cities there are Protestants,
                    Greek Christians, Jews, and Mahommedans, who are all tolerated. The country is
                    mountainous but fertile, and in the south yields abundance of olive oil, some
                    wine, and some silk. The government does not produce sufficient corn for its
                    consumption, but is well supplied from the neighbouring Austrian territories, or
                    occasionally from the Black Sea, by imports at Trieste and at Fiume.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Trieste,</hi> a maritime city, the capital of the
                    department of the same name in the Austrian kingdom of Illyria. It is an open
                    city, on the sea-shore, at the bottom of a deep bay at the head of the Adriatic
                    Sea. The shore here forms a semicircle, around which Trieste is built, and rises
                    like an amphitheatre, in a picturesque style, with lofty hills on both sides of
                    it. The town is beautiful, the streets are wide and clean, and the houses
                    generally high and well built. Though without walls, it is defended by a strong
                    citadel on a hill to the south, which commands the city. The public buildings,
                    except the cathedral and some other of the churches, are by no means very
                    splendid, but convenient and appropriate. Such are the palace, the custom-house,
                    the theatre, and, especially remarkable for its extent and accommodations, the
                    lazaretto. The last mentioned building deserves more notice, as being held the
                    most complete of the institutions to prevent the introduction of the plague,
                    that are to be seen in any part of the Mediterranean. This pile, which was built
                    in 1785, is cut off from all intercourse with the inhabitants by a high wall,
                    which entirely encircles it. It has a spacious harbour, well sheltered by a
                    strong mole, and is strictly guarded. The governor has a house within the
                    precincts, and is bound to go the rounds three times every night, in order to
                    see that the guards do their duty. Extensive magazines are attached to it for
                    the exposure of goods. It contains thirty-two sets of apartments for passengers,
                    who are locked in every night. the captains and crews of ships are permitted
                    (always with a guard) to go on shore and walk in a large square appropriated to
                    them, and separated by a high wall from another which is designed for the
                    passengers who have left the ships. Every Sunday the crews of the vessels are
                    allowed to come on shore to attend mass in the chapel of the lazaretto, but with
                    every requisite precaution. In the bay of Trieste there is good anchorage over
                    the greater part, varying from seven to fourteen fathoms of water, with a muddy
                    bottom. The best spot is in seven fathoms, when the citadel and the theatre are
                    in a line from it. The harbour is formed by a mole lying to the northward before
                    the city. It is very large, and capable of containing a great number of vessels.
                    It is somewhat exposed to the north-west and north winds, but is protected from
                    westerly winds by the long mole, on which is a battery. There is a canal running
                    nearly through the centre of the city, where vessels haul in to load and
                    unload.</p>
                <p part="N">Trieste was first made a free port in 1719, but was an inconsiderable
                    place, with not more than 6000 inhabitants, till 1753, when the Empress Maria
                    Theresa improved and enlarged it by a great variety of expensive operations. It
                    has since risen to its present condition, and is the chief place of
                    sea-communication with the rest of the world for the extensive dominions of the
                    house of Austria. It is said to have thirty-one plazas, 214 streets, seven
                    Catholic churches, one each for the Greek, the Lutheran, and the reformed
                    religion, and 58,600 inhabitants. They are principally composed of Germans and
                    Italians, but persons from almost every country are to be found domiciled. There
                    are said to be seventeen banking and insurance companies. 1000 mercantile houses
                    of all kinds, and 17,000 authorized and sworn brokers, who act also as
                    interpreters.</p>
                <p part="N">The foreign trade is extensive. Mr Money, the late English
                    consul-general, calculated the value of the goods imported to amount to
                    L.1,800,000 annually, and that of the goods exported to be nearly equal; but
                    this has been commonly deemed to be less than the actual value, especially as
                    regards the imports, which some authorities have estimated as high as
                    L.4,000,000, including such as are afterwards transhipped to the other Austrian
                    ports on the Adriatic, such as Venice, Fiume, and the islands on the coasts of
                    Dalmatia. The articles of gunpowder, salt, and tobacco are monopolized by the
                    government, and are not allowed to be imported but by the contractors, who are
                    under the finance department. Great vigilance is used to prevent the
                    introduction of those commodities, and an equal or greater degree of activity
                    prevails among contraband traders to supply them to the public; the high prices
                    which the government demand of the consumers acting as an incentive to evade or
                    defy the restrictions.</p>
