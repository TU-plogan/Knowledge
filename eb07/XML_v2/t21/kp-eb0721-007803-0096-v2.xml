                    solemnities.</p>

                    among the Romanists, is a large taper, to which the deacon applies five pieces
                    of frankincense, in holes made for the purpose in the form of a cross; and which
                    he lights with new fire in the ceremony of Easter Saturday. The Pontifical makes
                    Pope Zosimus the author of this usage; but Baronius will have it more ancient,
                    and quotes a hymn of Prudentius to prove it. That pope he supposes to have only
                    established the use of it in parish churches, which, till then, had been
                    restrained to greater churches. Papebroch explains the original of the paschal
                    taper more distinctly, in his <hi rend="italic">conatus Chronico-Historicus,
                        &amp;c.</hi> It seems, though the council of Nice regulated the day on which
                    Easter was to be celebrated, it enjoined the patriarch of Alexandria to make a
                    yearly canon of it, and to send it to the pope. As all the other moveable feasts
                    were to be regulated by that of Easter, a catalogue of them was made every year;
                    and this was written on a taper, <hi rend="italic">cereus,</hi> which was
                    blessed in the church with much solemnity. This taper, according to Chastelain,
                    was not a wax-candle made to be burnt; it had no wick, nor was it any thing more
                    than a kind of column of wax, made on purpose to write the list of moveable
                    feasts on, and which would suffice to hold that list for the space of a year.
                    For among the ancients, when any thing was to be written to last for ever, they
                    engraved it on marble or steel; when it was to last a long while, they wrote it
                    on Egyptian paper; and when it was only to last a short time, they contented
                    themselves to write it on wax. In process of time they came to write the
                    moveable feasts on paper, but they still fastened it to the paschal taper. Such
                    is the original of the benediction of the paschal taper.</p>
