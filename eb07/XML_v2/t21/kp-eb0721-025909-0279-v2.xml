                        tide.</hi> This rise or fall of the waters is exceedingly different at
                    different places, and is also variable everywhere. At Plymouth, for instance, it
                    is sometimes twenty feet between the greatest and least heights of the water in
                    one day, and sometimes only twelve feet. These different heights of tide succeed
                    each other in a regular series, diminishing from the greatest to the least, and
                    then increasing from the least to the greatest. The greatest is called a <hi
                        rend="italic">spring tide,</hi> and the least a <hi rend="italic">neap
                        tide.</hi> This series is completed in about fifteen days. More careful
                    observation shows that two series arc completed in the time of a lunation. For
                    the spring tide in any place happens at a certain interval of time, generally
                    between one and two days, after new or full moon; and the neap tide at a certain
                    interval after the quarter: or, more accurately speaking, the spring tide occurs
                    when the moon has got a certain number of degrees eastward either from the line
                    of conjunction with the sun or of opposition to him, and the neap tide when she
                    is at a certain distance from her first or last quadrature. Thus the whole
                    series of tides appears to be chiefly regulated by the moon, and seems to be
                    only to a small extent under the influence of the sun; for it is further
                    observed that high water happens when the moon has nearly a certain position
                    with respect to the meridian of the place of observation, preceding or following
                    the moon’s southing by a certain interval of time; which, at new and full moon,
                    is generally not far from being constant with respect to the same place, but
                    very different in different places; whereas the interval between the time of
                    high water and noon changes almost everywhere about six hours in the course of a
                    fortnight.</p>
                <p part="N">The interval between two succeeding high waters is variable. It is
                    shortest about new and full moon, being then about 12 <hi rend="superscript">
                        h</hi> ∙ 19 <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> ∙; and about the time of the
                    moon’s quadra-ratures it is 12 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ 30 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> m</hi> ∙ But these intervals are somewhat different at
                    different places. The tides in similar circumstances are greatest when the moon
                    is in the equator, and at her smallest distance from the earth, or in her
                    perigee; and, gradually diminishing, are smallest when she is in her apogee, and
                    farthest from the equator.</p>
                <p part="N">Such are some of the more general and regular phenomena of the tides. In
                    certain places there are four tides in the lunar day, in others but one; and in
                    some there is scarcely any perceptible variation of level, which regularly keeps
                    time with the moon. The tides being important to all commercial nations, great
                    exertions have recently been made to obtain the means of predicting them. Some
                    account <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=280"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0721-0280-0260"/>of these and other empirical researches, which
                    have of late been conducted on an extensive scale and with great care, will be
                    given in the latter part of this article.</p>
                <p part="N">It is of tides, most probably, the Bible speaks, when God is said to set
                    bounds to the sea, and to say, “thus far shall it go, and no farther.” Homer
                    would be the earliest profane author who notices the tides, if indeed it be to
                    them he refers (in the 12th book of the Odyssey) when he speaks of Charybdis
                    rising and retiring thrice a day. Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus speak more
                    distinctly of the tides in the Red Sea. Pytheas of Marseille is the first who
                    says any thing of their cause. According to Strabo, he had been in Britain,
                    where he must have observed the tides of the ocean. Plutarch says expressly that
                    Pytheas ascribed them to the moon. It is remarkable that Aristotle says so
                    little about the tides. The army of Alexander, his pupil, were startled at first
                    seeing them near the Persian Gulf; and Aristotle would probably be well informed
                    of all that had been observed there. But in all his writings there are only
                    three passages concerning them, and these are very trivial. In one place he
                    speaks of great tides in the north of Europe; in another, of their having been
                    ascribed by some to the moon; and in a third, he says, the tide in a great sea
                    exceeds that in a small one.</p>
                <p part="N">The Greeks had little opportunity of observing the tides. The conquests
                    and the commerce of the Romans gave them more acquaintance with them. Caesar
                    speaks of them in the fourth book of his Gallic War. Strabo, after Posidonius,
                    classes the phenomena into daily, monthly, and annual. He observes, that the sea
                    rises as the moon approaches the meridian, whether above or below the horizon,
                    and falls again as she rises or falls; that the tides increase at the time of
                    new and full moon, and are greatest at the summer solstice. Pliny explains the
                    phenomena at some length, and ascribes them to the sun and moon dragging the
                    waters along with them (b. ii. c. 97). Seneca (<hi rend="italic">Nat.
                        Quest,</hi> iii. 28) speaks of the tides with correctness; and Macrobius
                        (<hi rend="italic">Somn. Scip.</hi> i. 6) gives a tolerable description of
                    their motions. Such phenomena naturally exercise human curiosity as to their
                    cause. Plutarch (<hi rend="italic">Placit. Phil.</hi> iii. 17), Galileo <hi
                        rend="italic">(Sgsr. Mund.</hi> dial. 4), Riccioli in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Almagest,</hi> ii. p. 374, and Gassendi, ii. p. 27, have collected most of
                    the notions of their predecessors on the subject; but they are of so little
                    importance as not to deserve our notice. Kepler, in accounting for the tides
                        (<hi rend="italic">De Stella Martis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Epit.
                        Astron.</hi> p. 555), had evidently been aware of the principle of
                    gravitation, but not of the law. He says that all bodies attract each other, and
                    that the waters of the ocean would all go to the moon were they not retained by
                    the attraction of the earth. He then proceeds to explain their elevation under
                    the moon and on the opposite side, because the earth is less attracted by the
                    moon than the nearer waters, but more than the waters which are more remote. The
                    honour of a complete explanation of the tides in a general way was reserved for
                    Sir Isaac Newton. He laid hold of this class of phenomena as the most
                    incontestable proof of universal gravitation, and has given a most beautiful and
                    synoptical view of the whole subject; contenting himself, however, with merely
                    exhibiting the chief consequences of the general principle, and applying it to
                    the phenomena with singular address.</p>
                <p part="N">The investigation of the phenomena of the tides has been justly
                    considered as uniting some of the greatest difficulties that occur in the
                    various departments of natural philosophy and astronomy. It implies, first, a
                    knowledge of the laws of gravitation, concerned in the determination of the
                    forces immediately acting on the sea, and of the periods and distances of the
                    celestial bodics, which modify the magnitudes and combinations of these forces;
                    and, secondly, of the hydraulic theories of the resistances of fluids, and of
                    the motions of waves and undulations of all kinds, and of the theoretical
                    determination of the form and density of the earth, as well as of the
                    geographical observation of the breadth and depth of the seas and lakes which
                    occupy a part of its surface; so that the whole subject affords abundant scope
                    for the exercise of mathematical skill, and still more for the employment of
                    that invention and contrivance which enables its possessor to supersede the
                    necessity of prolix com· putations wherever they can be avoided.</p>
                <p part="N">The history of the theory of the tides is naturally divided into several
                    periods in which its different departments have been progressively cultivated.
                    The ancients from the times of Posidonius and Pytheas, and the moderns before
                    Newton, were contented with observing the general dependence of the tides on the
                    moon, as following her transit at an interval of about two hours, and their
                    alternate increase and decrease not only every fortnight, but also in the lunar
                    period of about eight years. The second step consisted in the determination of
                    the magnitude and direction of the solar and lunar forces, by which the general
                    effects of the tides were shown, in the <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> to be
                    the necessary consequences of these forces. The third great point was the
                    demonstration of Maclaurin, that the form of an elliptic spheroid affords an
                    equilibrium under the action of the disturbing forces concerned; while the
                    further contemporary illustrations of the subject by Euler and Bernoulli, though
                    they afforded some useful details, involved no new principle that can be put in
                    competition with Maclaurin’s demonstration. The fourth important step was made
                    by Laplace, who separated the consideration of the <hi rend="italic">form</hi>
                    affording mere equilibrium, from that of the <hi rend="italic">morion</hi>
                    occasioned by the continual change of that form; while former theorists had
                    taken it for granted that the surface of the sea very speedily assumed the
                    figure of a fluid actuated by similar forces, but remaining perfectly at rest,
                    or assuming instantly the form in question. Laplace’s computation is however
                    limited to the case of an imaginary ocean, of a certain variable depth, assumed
                    for the convenience of calculation, rather than for any other reason. Dr Thomas
                    Young has extended Laplace’s mode of considering the phenomena to the more
                    general case of an ocean covering a part only of the earth’s surface, and more
                    or less irregular in its form; he has also attempted to comprehend in his
                    calculations the precise effects of hydraulic friction on the times and
                    magnitudes of the tides. As far as the resistance may be supposed to vary in the
                    simple ratio of the velocity, Dr Young’s theory is sufficiently complete, and
                    explains several of the peculiarities which are otherwise paradoxical in their
                    appearance; but there still remains a difficulty to be combated with respect to
                    the effects of a resistance proportional to the square of the velocity, and
                    this, it is hoped, will be in great measure removed in the present article,
                    which, however, from the space that is allotted to it, must be considered rather
                    as a supplementary fragment than as a complete treatise. This theory will be
                    divided into four sections: the first relating to the contemporaneous progress
                    of the tides through the different seas and oceans, as collected from
                    observation only; the second to the magnitude of the disturbing forces tending
                    to change the form of the surface of the earth and sea; the third to the theory
                    of compound vibrations with resistance; and the fourth to the application of
                    this theory to the progress and successive magnitudes of the tides, as
                    observable at any one port.</p>

                <p part="N">The least theoretical consideration relating to the tides, is that of
                    their progress through the different parts of the ocean, and of its dependent
                    seas. The analysis of these ought to be very completely attainable from direct

                    observed at a sufficient number of ports throughout the world; and, on the other
                    hand, if the earth were covered in all parts with a fluid of great and nearly
                    uniform depth, the tides of this fluid would be so regular, that a very few
                    observations would be sufficient to enable us to deduce the whole of the
                    phenomena from theory, and to trace the great waves, which would follow the sun
                    and moon round the globe, so as to make its circuit in a day, without any
                    material deviation from uniformity of motion and succession. Having collected,
                    for the actual state of the sea and continents, an abundant store of accurate
                    observations of the precise time of high water with regard to the sun and moon,
                    for every part of the surface, and having arranged them in a table according to
                    the order of their occurrence, as expressed in the time of any one meridian, we
                    might then suppose lines to be drawn on a terrestrial globe, through all the
                    places of observation, in the same order; and these lines would indicate,
                    supposing the places to be sufficiently numerous, so as to furnish a series of
                    tides very nearly contemporary, the directions of the great waves, to which that
                    of the progress of the tides in succession must be perpendicular. If, however,
                    we actually make such an attempt, we shall soon find how utterly inadequate the
                    observations that have been recorded are, for the purpose of tracing the forms
                    of the lines of contemporary high water with accuracy or with certainty,
                    although they are abundantly sufficient to show the impossibility of deducing
                    the time of high water at any given place from the Newtonian hypothesis, or even
                    from that of Laplace, without some direct observation. It might at least be
                    supposed very easy to enumerate the existing observations, scanty as they may
                    be, in a correct order; but there is a number of instances in which it is wholly
                    uncertain whether the time observed at a given port relates to the tide of the
                    same morning in the open ocean, or to that of the preceding evening. This
                    inconvenience may, however, in some measure be remedied, by inserting such
                    places in two different parts of the table, at the distance of twelve and a half
                    hours from each other. The following table is the result of an approximation
                    obtained in this manner, the principal hour-lines having been partially traced
                    on a map of the world, in order to afford some little direction to the correct
                    insertion of the times of high water without the material error of half a
                    day.</p>

                <p part="N">It may be immediately inferred from this table, first, that the line of
                    contemporary tides is seldom in the exact direction of the meridian, as it is
                    supposed to be universally in the theory of Newton and of Laplace; except,
                    perhaps, the line for the twenty-first hour in the Indian Ocean, which appears
                    to extend from Socotora to the Almirantes and the Isle of Bourbon, lying nearly
                    in the same longitude. Secondly, the southern extremity of the line advances as
                    it passes the Cape of Good Hope, so that it turns up towards the Atlantic, which
                    it enters obliquely, so as to arrive, nearly at the same moment, at the Island
                    of Ascension, and at the Island of Martin Vaz, or of the Trinity. Thirdly, after
                    several irregularities about the Cape Verd Islands, and in the West Indies, the
                    line appears to run nearly east and west from St Domingo to Cape Blanco, the
                    tides proceeding due northwards; and then, turning still more to the right, the
                    line seems to run north-west and south-east, till at last the tide runs almost
                    due east up the British Channel and round the north of Scotland into the
                    Northern Ocean, sending off a branch down the North Sea to meet the succeeding
                    tide at the mouth of the Thames. Fourthly, towards Cape Horn, again, there is a
                    good deal of irregularity; the hour-lines are much compressed between South
                    Georgia and Tierra del Fuego, perhaps on account of the shallower water about
                    the Falkland lslands and South Shetland. Fifthly, at the entrance of the Pacific
                    Ocean, the tides seem to advance very rapidly to New Zealand and Easter Island;
                    but here it appears to be uncertain whether the line of contemporary tide should
                    be drawn nearly north and south from the Gallapagos to Tierra del Fuego, or
                    north-east and south-west from Easter Island to New Zealand; or whether both
                    these partial directions are correct: but on each side of this line there are
                    great irregularities, and many more observations are wanting before the progress
                    of the tide can be traced with any tolerable accuracy, among the multitudinous
                    islands of the Pacific Ocean, where it might have been hoped that the phenomena
                    would have been observed in their greatest simplicity, and in their most genuine
                    form. Lastly, of the Indian Ocean the northern parts exhibit great
                    irregularities, and among the rest they afford the singular phenomenon of one
                    tide in the day, observed by Halley in the port of Tonkin, and explained by
                    Newton in the <hi rend="italic">Principia:</hi> the southern parts are only
                    remarkable for having the hour-lines of contemporary tides considerably crowded
                    between New Holland and the Cape of Good Hope, as if the seas of these parts
                    were shallower than elsewhere.</p>
                <p part="N">These inferences respecting the progress of the tides are not advanced
                    as the result of any particular theory, nor even as the only ones that might
                    possibly be deduced from the table. Thus the supposion that the direction in
                    which the tides advance must be perpendicular to the hour-lines of contemporary
                    tides, is not by any means absolutely without exception, since a quadrangular
                    lake, with steep shores in the direction of the meridian, would have the times
                    of high water the same for every point of its eastern or western halves
                    respectively, and there could be no correctly defined direction of the
                    hour-lines in such a case. But if any portion of the sea could be considered as
                    constituting such a lake, its properties would be detected by a sufficient
                    number of observations of high water; and the existing table does not appear to
                    indicate any such cases that require to be otherwise distinguished than as
                    partial irregularities. There may also be some doubt respecting the propriety of
                    the addition of twelve and a half hours that has been made to the time of high
                    water in the north-eastern parts of the Atlantic: but it seems extremely
                    improbable that the same tide should travel north-easterly into the English
                    Channel and into the Northern Ocean, and at the same time westerly across the
                    Atlantic, as it must be supposed to do, if it were considered as primarily
                    originating in the neighbour hood of the Bay of Biscay. On the other hand, the
                    bending of the great wave round the continents of Africa and Europe seems to be
                    very like the sort of refraction which takes place on every shelving coast with
                    respect to the common waves, which, whatever may have been their primitive
                    origin, acquire always, as they spread, a direction more and more nearly
                    parallel to that of the coast which they are approaching: and the suppositions
                    which have been here advanced respecting the succession of the tides in
                    different ports, allowing for the effect of a multitude of irregularities
                    proceeding from partial causes, appear to be by far the most probable that can
                    be immediately inferred from the table, at least in its present state of
                    imperfection.</p>

                <p part="N">Since the phenomena of the tides, with regard to their progress through
                    the different oceans and seas, as they exist in the actual state of the earth’s
                    surface, appear to be too complicated to allow us to hope to reduce them to
                    computation by means of any general theory, we must, in the next place, confine
                    our attention to the order in which the successive changes occur in any single
                    port; and having determined the exact magnitude of the forces that tend to
                    change the form of the surface of the ocean at different periods, and having
                    also examined the nature of the vibratory motions of which the sea, or any given
                    portion of it, would be susceptible, in the simplest cases, after the cessation
                    of the disturbing forces, we must afterwards endeavour to combine these causes,
                    so as to adapt the result to the successive phenomena which are observed at
                    different times in any one port.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> A. (“E.”—Nicholson’s Journal, July
                    1813.) The disturbing force of a distant attractive body, urging a particle of a
                    fluid in the direction of the surface of a sphere, varies as the sine of twice
                    the altitude of the body.</p>
                <p part="N">The mean attraction exerted by the sun and moon on all the separate
                    particles composing the earth, is exactly compensated by the centrifugal force
                    derived from the earth’s annual revolution round the sun, and from its monthly
                    revolution round the common centre of gravity of the earth and moon; but the
                    difference of the attractions exerted at different points of the earth, must
                    necessarily produce a disturbing force, depending on the angular position of the
                    point with regard to the sun or moon, since the centrifugal force is the same
                    for them all; the disturbing force being constantly variable for any one point,
                    and depending partly on the difference of the distance of the point from the
                    mean distance, and partly on the difference of the direction of the luminary
                    from its direction with respect to the centre, or, in other words, on its
                    parallax.</p>
                <p part="N">In the case of a sphere covered with a fluid, it will be most convenient
                    for computation to consider both these forces as referred to the direction of
                    the circumference of the sphere, which will differ but little from that of the
                    fluid; and it will appear that both of them, when reduced to this direction,
                    will vary as the product of the sine and cosine of the distance from the
                    diameter pointing to the luminary, that is, as half the sine of twice the
                    altitude: for the difference of gravitation, which depends on the difference of
                    the distance, will always vary as the sine of the distance from the bisecting
                    plane perpendicular to that diameter, and will be reduced to the direction of
                    the surface by diminishing it in the ratio of the cosine to the radius; and the
                    effect of the difference of direction will be originally proportional to the
                    sine of the distance from the diameter, and will in like manner be expressed,
                    when reduced, by the product of the sine and cosine; and each force, thus
                    reduced, will be equal, where it is greatest, to half of its primitive
                    magnitude, since sin. cos. 45° = ½. “Thus, the gravitation towards the <pb

                    part of it, without friction, may be held in equilibrium by the attraction of a
                    distant body [situated in the direction of the axis].</p>
                <p part="N">If a sphere be inscribed in an oblong spheroid, the elevation of the
                    spheroid above the sphere must obviously be proportional, when measured in a
                    direction parallel to the axis of the spheroid, to the ordinate of the sphere,
                    that is, to the sine of the distance from its equator; and when reduced to a
                    direction perpendicular to the surface of the sphere, it must be proportional to
                    the square of that sine; and the tangent of the inclination to the surface of
                    the sphere, which is equal to the fluxion of the elevation divided by that of
                    the circumference, must be expressed by twice the continual product of the sine,
                    the cosine, and the ellipticity, or rather the greater elevation <hi

                <p part="N">If, therefore, the density of the elevated parts be considered as
                    evanescent, and their attraction be neglected, there will be an equilibrium,

                    contrary to that portion of the force of gravitation which urges it in the

                    being 20 839 000 feet, the greatest height of a lunar tide in equilibrium would
                    be 2·0166 feet, and that of a solar tide ·8097: that is, supposing the moon’s
                    horizonal parallax about 57', and her mass <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi

                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> C. [G.] The disturbing attraction of
                    the thin shell contained between a spheroidical surface and its inscribed
                    sphere, varies in the same proportion as the inclination of the surface, and is
                    to the relative force of gravity depending on that inclination, as three times
                    the density of the shell to five times that of the sphere.</p>
                <p part="N">We may imagine the surface of the sphere to be divided by an infinite
                    number of parallel and equidistant circles, beginning from any point at which a
                    gravitating particle is situated, and we may suppose all these circles to be
                    divided by a plane perpendicular to the meridian of the point, and consequently
                    bisecting the equatorial plane of the spheroid: it is obvious, that if the
                    elevations on the opposite sides of the plane be equal at the corresponding
                    points of each circle, no lateral force will be produced; but when they are
                    unequal, the excess of the elevated matter on one side above that of the other
                    side will produce a disturbing or lateral force. Now, the elevation being
                    everywhere as the square of the distance <hi rend="italic">x</hi> from the

                    be cos. ψ, if ψ be the angular distance of the circle from its pole; and calling
                        <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> the distance of this pole from the equatorial plane

                    unit to the radius of this circle, which is sin. ψ. reduced again to a direction
                    perpendicular to the equatorial plane; whence <hi rend="italic">x'</hi> — <hi

                    of the gravitating particle, the effective elevation at each point of the

                    plane, the other quantities concerned remaining the same in all positions. But
                    the inclination of the surface of the spheroid, as well as the original
                    disturbing force, varies in the same proportion of the product of the sine and
                    cosine of the distance <hi rend="italic">φ</hi>; consequently the sum of this
                    disturbing attraction and the original force will also vary as the inclination
                    of the surface, and may be in equilibrium with the tendency to descend towards
                    the centre, provided that the ellipticity be duly commensurate to the density of

                    with a depression equal and similar to its elevation, striking against a solid
                    vertical obstacle, will be reflected, so as to cause a part of the surface, at
                    the distance of one fourth of its whole breadth, to remain at rest; and if there
                    be another opposite obstacle at twice that distance, there may be a perpetual
                    vibration between the surfaces, the middle point having no vertical motion. Dr

                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Scholium</hi> 1. The elevation and depression of a
                    spheroid, compared with the surface of the sphere of equal magnitude, exhibits a
                    symmetrical wave in the sense of the proposition; and it is not necessary that
                    the shores should be very rocky or perpendicular, in order to produce a strong
                    reflection; for even the vibration of the water in the bottom of a common
                    hemispherical basin is considerably permanent.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Corollary</hi> 3. The vibrations of the water supposed
                    to be contained in a canal, following the direction of the equator, and 90° in
                    length, would be synchronous with the passage of a wave 180° in breadth, over
                    any point of a canal of the same depth, and surrounding the whole globe.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Scholium</hi> 2. It has been usual to consider the
                    elevation of the tides as identical with that of an oblong spheroid, measured at
                    its vertex, and therefore as amounting to twice as much as the depression of the
                    same spheroid at the equator, considered in relation to the mean height
                    belonging to a sphere of the same magnitude; but the supposition is by no means
                    applicable to the case of a globe covered partially and irregularly with water,
                    so that in almost all cases of actual tides, the elevation must be considered as
                    little if at all greater than the depression, as far as this cause only is
                    concerned; there are, however, some other reasons to expect that the elevation
                    of the great wave might often arrive at a distant port in somewhat greater force
                    than the depresssion.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> F. [K.] The oscillations of the sea
                    and of lakes, constituting the tides, are subject to laws exactly similar to
                    those of pendulums capable of performing vibrations in the same time, and
                    suspended from points which are subjected to compound regular vibrations, of
                    which the constituent periods are completed in half a lunar and half a solar day
                    [or in some particular cases a whole day].</p>
                <p part="N">Supposing the surface of the sea to remain at rest, each point of it
                    would become alternately elevated and depressed, in comparison with the
                    situation in which it might remain in equilibrium; its distance from this
                    situation varying according to the regular law of the pendulum (see Theorem B);
                    and, like all minute vibrations, it will be actuated by forces indirectly
                    dependent on, and proportional to, this distance; so that it may be compared to
                    a pendulous body remaining at rest in the vertical line, about which its point
                    of suspension vibrates, and will consequently follow the motion of the temporary
                    horizon, in the same manner as the pendulum follows the vibration of its point
                    of suspension, either with a direct or a retrograde motion, according to
                    circumstances, which will be hereafter explained: the operation of the forces
                    concerned being perfectly analogous, whether we consider the simple hydrostatic
                    pressure depending on the elevation, or the horizontal pressure derived from the
                    inclination of the surface, or the differential force immediately producing
                    elevation and depression, depending on the variation of the horizontal pressure,
                    and proportional to the curvature of the surface. It becomes therefore
                    necessary, for the theory of the tides, to investigate minutely the laws of
                    these compound and compulsory vibrations, which, together with the resistances
                    affecting them, will be the subject of the next section.</p>
