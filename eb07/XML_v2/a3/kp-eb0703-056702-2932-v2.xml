                    Noah built and finished his ark is no less a matter of disputation; but the most
                    general opinion is, that it was built in Chaldea, in the territories <pb

                    />of Babylon. Its dimensions, as given by Moses, are 300 cubits in length, 50 in
                    breadth, and 30 in height; which 'some have thought too scanty, considering the
                    number of things it was to contain; and hence an· argument has been drawn
                    against the authority of the relation. But Buteo and Kircher have shown
                    geometrically, that, taking the common cubit of a foot and a half, the ark was
                    .sufficient for all the animals supposed to be lodged in it. Father Lamy
                    contends that it was 110 feet longer than the church of St Mary at Paris, and 64
                    feet narrower; and Dr Arbuthnot computes it to have been 81,062 tons. It
                    contained, besides eight persons of Noah’s family, one pair of every species of
                    unclean animals, and seven pair of every species of clean animals, with
                    provisions for them all during the whole year. By the description Moses gives of
                    the ark, it appears to have been divided into three stories, each ten cubits or
                    15 feet high; and it is agreed on, as most probable, that the lowest story was
                    for the beasts, the middle for the food, and the upper for the birds, with Noah
                    and his family.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Ark</hi><hi rend="italic">of the
                        Covenant,</hi> a small chest or coffer, three feet nine inches in length,
                    two feet three inches in breadth, and two feet three inches in height, in which
                    were contained the golden pot that held manna, and Aaron’s rod, and the tables
                    of the covenant. This coffer was made of shittim-wood, and covered with a lid,
                    which was made of solid gold. The ark was reposited in the holiest place of the
                    tabernacle. It was taken by the Philistines, and detained 20, some say 40 years,
                    at Kirjath-jearim; but the people being afflicted with emerods on account of it,
                    returned it with divers presents. It was afterwards placed in the temple. The
                    lid or covering of the ark was called the <hi rend="italic">propitiatory</hi> or
                        <hi rend="italic">mercy-seat</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> over which were
                    two figures placed called <hi rend="italic">cherubims,</hi> with expanded wings
                    of a peculiar form. Here the Schechinah rested both in the tabernacle and temple
                    in a visible cloud, hence were issued the Divine oracles by an audible voice;
                    and the high priest appeared before this mercy-seat once every year, on the
                    great day of expiation; and the Jews, where-ever they worshipped, turned their
                    faces towards the place where the ark stood. In the second temple there was also
                    an ark, made of the same shape and dimensions with the first, and put in the
                    same place, but without any of its contents and peculiar honours. It was used as
                    a representative of the former on the day of expiation, and as a repository of
                    the original copy of the Holy Scriptures, collected by Ezra and the men of the
                    great synagogue, after the captivity.</p>
