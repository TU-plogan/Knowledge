                        >George,</hi> son of an eminent surgeon at Paris, and some time professor of
                    surgery in the college of St Côsme. On account of an accident that occurred
                    while he was practising midwifery, he removed from Paris to London, where he
                    acquired great repute by his operations, and his writings on surgical subjects.
                    Before his time the treatment of <hi rend="italic">hernia</hi> had been but
                    imperfectly understood; and the surgeons of this country are indebted to the
                    observations of Arnaud for many of those improvements which have since rendered
                    their practice so successful in this branch of the art. The following is a list
                    of his principal works:—1, Traité des Hernies ou Descentes, 2 vols. 12mo, Paris,
                    1749. 2, Observations on Aneurysms, London, 1750. 3, Instructions on the
                    Diseases of the Bladder and Urethra, London, 1763. 4, A Dissertation on
                    Hermaphrodites, London, 1750. These were afterwards collected and published,
                    with additions, under the title of Mémoires de Chirurgie, avec quelques
                    Remarques sur l’Etat de la Médecine et de la Chirurgie en France et en
                    Angleterre, 2 vols. 4to, London, 1768. 5, Remarks on the Use of the Extract of
                    Lead of Goulard, London, 1776. Arnaud died in 1774.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Arnaud de Villa Nova,</hi> a famous physician, who
                    lived about the end of the 13th and beginning of the 14th century. He studied at
                    Paris and Montpelier, and improved himself by visiting the schools of Italy and
                    Spain. He was well acquainted with languages, particularly with the Greek,
                    Hebrew, and Arabic. His desire after the acquisition of knowledge was ardent,
                    but it carried him too far in his researches. He put unlimited faith in
                    astrology, and published a prediction that the consummation of the world would
                    take place in the middle of the 14th century. He practised physic at Paris for
                    some time; but having advanced some new doctrines, he drew upon himself the
                    resentment of the university; and his friends, fearing he might be arrested,
                    persuaded him to retire from that city. Upon his leaving France he went to
                    Sicily, where he was received by king Frederic of Arragon with the greatest
                    marks of kindness and esteem. Some time afterwards this prince sent him to
                    France to attend pope Clement in an illness; and he was shipwrecked on the coast
                    of Genoa about the year 1313. His works, with a life prefixed, were printed at
                    Lyons in 1520, in one volume folio, and at Basil in 1585, with the notes of
                    Nicholas Tolerus.</p>
