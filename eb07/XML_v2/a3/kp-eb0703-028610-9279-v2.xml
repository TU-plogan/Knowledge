                    a pagan deity worshipped by the Greeks and Romans. Cicero mentions four of this
                    name, the most ancient of whom was the son of Vulcan; the second a son of
                    Corybas, and born in Crete; the third an Arcadian, called Nomian, from his being
                    a great legislator; and the last, to whom the greatest honour is ascribed, the
                    son of Jupiter and Latona.</p>
                <p part="N">Apollo had a variety of other names, either derived from his principal
                    attributes, or the chief places where he was worshipped. He was called the <hi
                        rend="italic">Healer,</hi> from his enlivening warmth and cheering
                    influence; <hi rend="italic">Nomius,</hi> or the shepherd, from his fertilizing
                    the earth, and thence sustaining the animal creation; <hi rend="italic"
                        >Delius,</hi> from his rendering all things manifest; <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pythius,</hi> from his victory over Python; <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lycias,</hi><hi rend="italic">Phcebus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Phaneta,</hi> from his purity and splendour. As Apollo is almost always
                    confounded by the Greeks with the sun, it is no wonder that he should be
                    dignified with so many attributes. It was natural for the most glorious object
                    in nature, whose influence is felt by all creation, and seen by every animated
                    part of it, to be adored as the fountain of light, heat, and life. The power of
                    healing diseases being chiefly given by the ancients to medicinal plants and
                    vegetable productions, it <pb break="no" facs="nls:193099292?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0703-9292-0287"/>was natural to exalt into a divinity the
                    visible cause of 'their growth. Henee he was also styled the <hi rend="italic"
                        >God of Physic</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that external heat which
                    cheers and invigorates all nature, being transferred from the human body to the
                    mind, gave rise to the idea of all mental effervescence coming from this god:
                    hence likewise, poets, prophets, and musicians, are said to be <hi rend="italic"
                        >Numine afflati,</hi> inspired by Apollo.</p>
                <p part="N">Whether Apollo was a real personage, or only the great luminary, many
                    have doubted. Vossius has taken great pains to prove this god to be only a
                    metaphorical being, and that there never was any other Apollo than the sun. « He
                    was styled the <hi rend="italic">Son of Jupiter f</hi> says this author,
                    “because that god was reckoned by the ancients the author of the world. His
                    mother was called <hi rend="italic">Latona,</hi> a name which signifies <hi
                        rend="italic">hidden,</hi> because’, before the sun was created, all things
                    were wrapped up in the obscurity of chaos. He is always represented as beardless
                    and youthful, because the sun never grows old or decays; and what else can his
                    bows and arrows imply, but his piercing beams ?” And he adds, that all the
                    ceremonies which were performed to his honour had a manifest relation to the
                    great source of light which he represented. However, though this be in general
                    true, it appears from many passages in ancient authors, that there was some
                    illustrious personage named <hi rend="italic">Apollo,</hi> who, after his
                    apotheosis, was taken for the sun; as Osiris and Orus in Egypt, whose existence
                    cannot be called in question, were, after their death, confounded with the sun,
                    of which they became the symbols, either from the glory and splendour of their
                    reişns,'or from a belief that their souls had taken up their residence in that
                    luminary.</p>
                <p part="N">Of the four Apollos mentioned by Cicero, it appears that the last three
                    were Greeks, and the first an Egyptian, who, according to Herodotus, was the Son
                    of Osiris and Isis, and called <hi rend="italic">Orus.</hi> Pausanias is of the
                    same opinion as Herodotus, and ranks Apollo among the Egyptian divinities. The
                    testimony of Diodorus Siculus is still more express; for in speaking of Isis,
                    after saying that, she had invented the practice of physic, he adds, that she
                    taught this art to her son Orus, named <hi rend="italic">Apollo,</hi> who was
                    the last of the gods that reigned in Egypt.</p>
                <p part="N">It is easy to trace almost all the Grecian fables and mythologies from
                    Egypt. If the Apollo of the Greeks was said to be the son of Jupiter, it was
                    because Orus, the Apollo of the Egyptians, had Osiris för his father, whom the
                    Greeks confounded with Jupiter. If the Greek Apollo was reckoned the god of
                    eloquence, music, medicine, and poetry, the reason was, that Osiris, who was the
                    symbol of the sun among the Egyptians, as well as his son Orus, had there taught
                    those liberal arts. If the Greek Apollo was the god and conductor of the Muses,
                    it was because I Osiris carried with hiιfi, in his expedition to’the Indies,
                    singing women and musicians. This parallel might be carried on still further;
                    but enough has been said to prove hat the true Apollo was that of Egypt.</p>
                <p part="N">ſo the other perfections of this divinity the poets have added beauty,
                    grace, and the art of captivating the ear and the heart, no less by the
                    sweetness of his eloquence, than by the melodious sounds of his lyre.</p>
                <p part="N">. The defeat oí the serpent Python forms a celebrated mt in the history
                    of Apollo. The waters of Deuca-ιon s deluge, says Ovid, which had overflowed the
                    earth, eft a slime, from whenee sprung innumerable monsters; and among others
                    the serpent Python, which made great ιavock in the country about Parnassus.

                    the priests of that god, put him to death.</p>
                <p part="N">This event gave rise to the institution of the Pythian games, so
                    frequently mentioned in the Grecian history; and it was from the legend of
                    Apollo’s victory over the Python that the god himself acquired the name of <hi

                    taken and plundered by the French in 1797. This celebrated statué was found in
                    the ruins of ancient Antium about the end of the 15th century. The artist is
                    unknown.</p>
