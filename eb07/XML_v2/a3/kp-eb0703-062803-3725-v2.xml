                    formed, is one in Otaheite and the neighbouring islands for the destruction of
                    their own species, <hi rend="italic">called^Arreoy, Aτehοe,</hi> or <hi

                    remarkable that it should subsist among tribes distinguished for courteousness
                    and humanity. Wc read in the older authors that there is an absolute prohibition
                    against the females of Formosa rearing children before the age of thirty-six,
                    though it does not appear that there is any limitation as to the age at which
                    their espousals may take place. But in the event of pregnancy, it is necessary
                    that abortion should follow, which is accomplished by the aid of the priestesses
                    of the island. Among the Arreoys, however, extirpation of the infant being
                    constitutes the leading feature of their ordinances.</p>

                    reserved for those of later date to unfold its principles and peculiarities,
                    though, indeed, its constitution is still enveloped in much mystery, the members
                    being bound to the strictest secrecy.</p>
                <p part="N">The society of Arreoys consists of hundreds or perhaps thousands of both
                    sexes, who engage to destroy their own offspring at the moment of birth. It is
                    chiefly composed of persons distinguished by valour and merit, and hence one or
                    more individuals of each family of the chiefs are of the number. It has been
                    remarked, that all the men profess themselves warriors, and are in general stout
                    and well made; that the greatest trust and confidence are reposed in them; and
                    it rather appears that the women consist of the higher ranks only. There are
                    different gradations in this community, which are to be recognised from the mode
                    of tattooing: the more profusely the men are tattooed, the higher is their rank
                    in society; the first are called <hi rend="italic">Ava bly αreema tutοwe</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> 2, <hi rend="italic">Areernα bly;</hi> 3, <hi
                        rend="italic">Ahοwhοa</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Harrotxa; 5, Eote οle</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 6, 7, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Po</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and youths training up are designed <hi
                        rend="italic">Mο</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the meaning of these names
                    is not explained. By the fundamental laws of the society, the offspring must be
                    destroyed, yet it is not known with certainty by whom or in what particular
                    manner; the murder is always perpetrated in secret, probably by strangulation;
                    all the attendants are excluded; for it is said, were they to witness it they
                    would be adjudged guilty of participation, and put to death. Sometimes the
                    mother, animated by natural affection, tries to preserve her infant, and resists
                    the persuasions of her husband and his brother Arreoys, who wish to consign it
                    to destruction. But in general ţhe enormity of the crime does not appal the
                    females, though they are described to be affectionate and tender. We find a
                    dancing girl pregnant by an Arreoy expressing herself thus to the English
                    navigators: “Perhaps the <hi rend="italic">Etοοa</hi> or deity of England might
                    be offended with the practices of the Arreoys, but her own was not displeased
                    with them. However, she promised if we would come from England for her child,
                    she might perhaps keep it alive, provided we gave her a hatchet, a shirt, and
                    some red feathers.” That the rules of the community are very strict, may be
                    inferred from an instance given by Captain Bligh. A chief, a member of the
                    society, married a sister of the king of Otaheite, by whom he had eight
                    children, and the whole were destroyed at their birth! Nor did this enormity
                    seem to originate from any other source, as the parents afterwards adopted a
                    nephew as their heir.</p>
                <p part="N">It may here be observed, that there are other practices among these
                    people regarding infanticide, which, though we want materials for positively
                    affirming the fact, may perhaps be connected with the institutions of the
                    Arreoys. When an Otaheitan chief has a child by a woman of the lower orders, it
                    is never suffered to live; and the like seems to take place reciprocally among
                    the higher ranks of females. The king and queen of Otaheite having ceased to
                    cohabit, he had taken another wife, and she associated with one of her
                    atfendants of low rank. When pregnant, the missionaries endeavoured to persuade
                    her to spare her child, which she said she would have done had it been her
                    husband’s, but now it would be base-born, and must perish; and she resisted all
                    entreaties to the contrary. Afterwards, having visited them, she excused herself
                    for having put the infant to death, stating that it was the custom of the
                    country to murder all base-born children, and hers being by a low man, she had
                    only complied with the usual practice. Indeed it is affirmed by the missionaries
                    who visited that island in 1797 to be a common proceeding among all ranks to
                    strangle infants the moment they are born. “A perpetrator of this horrid act,”
                    the narrator observes, “was among those whom curiosity attracted to visit us.
                    She was a good-looking woman, and esteemed by the natives a great beauty, which
                    I suppose to be the inducement that tempted her to murder her child; for here
                    the number of women bearing no proportion to the men, those esteemed handsome
                    were courted with great gifts, and got so accustomed to change their husbands,
                    to go with them from place to place, and run after the diversions of the island,
                    that rather than be debarred those pleasures, they stifle a parent’s feelings,
                    and murder their tender children.” Thus many hundreddľ born into the world are
                    never suffered to see the light; and so little criminality in the opinion of the
                    natives is attached to the deed, that many women disclose the number they have
                    put to death without scruple. It has bear calculated that at least two thirds of
                    the births on the island perish in this manner.</p>
                <p part="N">The Arreoys enjoy great privileges, and are everywhere united by the
                    reciprocal ties of friendship and hospitality. When they visit different
                    islands, they receive presents, and are entertained with feasting and dramatic
                    exhibitions; and all this they seem to expect rather as a matter of right than
                    of courtesy. Their clothes are of the finest materials. They pass their time in
                    luxurious idleness, perfuming their hair with fragrant oils, singing and playing
                    on the flute, and passing from one amusement to another. “Wherever they go,”
                    says Forster, “the train of sensual pleasure awaits them." They feast on the
                    choicest vegetables; and an abundance of dogs’ flesh and poultry are liberally
                    provided by the lower classes for their entertainment. They are copiously
                    supplied with <hi rend="italic">kava;</hi> and for them are performed nocturnal
                    sports of music and lascivious dances, to which no other spectators are
                    admitted. Their presence seems to enliven the whole country; and among the
                    various entertainments to which it gives birth, is one called <hi rend="italic"
                        >hοpοwpah,</hi> of a dramatic nature, in which they themselves act a part.
                    As soon as one Arreoy visits another, though a stranger, he immediately has his
                    wants supplied and his wishes gratified; he is introduced' to other members, who
                    vie with each other in loading him with courtesies and presents. They are of all
                    others the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103738?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0703-3738-0629"/>most luxurious and profuse, often consuming
                    the whole provisions of a district. When Captain Cook lay at Hua-hei∏e, no less
                    than 70 canoes were observed crossing over to another island with 700 Arreoys on
                    board; and thus they keep great meetings at appointed times, and travel in
                    companies from one island to another. It has been affirmed, but perhaps without
                    sufficient foundation, that a promiscuous intercourse of the sexes prevails in
                    their society; however, they are permitted great latitude in their amours,
                    except in times of danger, as almost all are fighting men. Sufficient
                    inducements are, therefore, held out to be admitted into this mysterious
                    community.</p>
                <p part="N">Any one may withdraw at pleasure from the society; and an example is
                    given of a chief who had killed his firstborn child, but preserved the second,
                    having withdrawn in the interval. A woman who ceases to be an Arreoy incurs a
                    reproachful name, signifying “bearer of children.” Thus, while in most other
                    countries the name of parent confers honour, and respect, among the Arreoys of
                    Otaheite it is used as a term of contempt and reproach. A chief of some repute,
                    hearing that the king of Great Britain had a numerous offspring, declared that
                    “he thought himself a much greater man, because he belonged to the Arreoys.”</p>
                <p part="N">With respect to the origin of this society, Forster was the first to
                    offer any conjectures, <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> In a country,” says he,
                    “which has emerged so lately from barbarism as Otaheite, we cannot suppose that
                    such a community, which is evidently injurious to the rest of the nation, would
                    have maintained itself to the present time, were not its advantages so
                    considerable as to require its continuance.” There are two causes, he adds,
                    which favour the existence of the Arreoys; first, the necessity for entertaining
                    a body of warriors to defend. their fellow-citizens from the invasions and
                    depredations of enemies; secondly, it was necessary, by such an association, to
                    prevent the too rapid increase of the number of their chiefs. “Perhaps,” he
                    remarks, “some intelligent Otaheitan lawgiver might foresee that the common
                    people would at length groan űnder the yoke of such petty tyrants, whose number
                    was ever multiplying.” The ordinary practice of infanticide is ascribed by Mr
                    Wilson, who visited the South Seas in 1801, merely to the love of pleasure and
                    avarice, which latter passion had gained great ascendancy since the intercourse
                    of the islanders with Europeans: “being well aware,” says he, “that the beauty
                    of females rearing families experiences an earlier decay, it is anxiously
                    preserved for their visitors, by destruction of their offspring, or even by
                    procuring abortion.” Before offering any opinion on this point, we shall notice
                    a custom in the northwest of India somewhat analogous, which also is attended
                    with mystery.</p>
                <p part="N">Amongst certain tribes ca!led Jarejahs, which are more particularly
                    disseminated in the peninsula of Guzerat, the whole females are devoted to death
                    at the moment of their birth. But this is in consequence of general custom, not
                    of any special association. The immediate death of a daughter is viewed as the
                    inevitable consequence of its birth; and the innocent beings falling a sacrifice
                    to this barbarous ordinance yearly amount to many thousands. When a woman is
                    delivered of a daughter, the event is communicated by the female attendants to
                    the father, who desires them to do as is customary; an injunction said to be
                    followed by the mother applying a little opium θn the nipple of her breast,
                    which is sucked in by the child. More usually it is strangled by herself, or
                    drowned in a basin of milk; but women of rank, who have attendants, never
                    perform the office themselves. However, from the mystery observed, it is, as
                    among the Arreoys, difficult to obtain correct information. In some districts,
                    any of the female attendants may put the infant to death; in others, a kind of
                    domestic priest becomes the executioner; and the infant being placed naked in a
                    small basket, it is carried out to be interred, for which he receives a trifling
                    fee. Among the Arreoys, those who preserve their children seem to suffer a
                    degree of degradation; and they plead as an apology for their destruction, that
                    it is necessary to preserve the privileges of their tribe. With the Jarejahs,
                    the father is obeyed on signifying his desire for preservation; but if he
                    continues silent on receiving the intelligence, the usual custom must be
                    complied with. The mother is generally averse to the sacrifice, but her scruples
                    to preserve her offspring are seldom attended to; should a short interval
                    elapse, however, before the bloody deed is done, it then becomes unlawful, and
                    the child must be spared.</p>
                <p part="N">Perhaps the murderous practices of the Arreoys in the South Sea islands
                    may have originated in some religious principle. At the same time, it appears
                    that, in the ordinary destruction of infants by the islanders of the South
                    Pacific Ocean, there is nothing of a sacrificial nature; for though they do not
                    suppose that their displeasure is thereby incurred, they do not pretend that the
                    practice is acceptable to any of their divinities. Mr Malthus, we may add,
                    ascribes the origin of the Arreoy institutions to a superabundance of
                    population, and the necessity of adopting some forcible expedients to bring it
                    within the limits of subsistence. (See Forster’s <hi rend="italic">Voyage,</hi>
