                        >apprendre,</hi> to learn), one who is bound by covenant to serve a
                    tradesman or artificer a certain time, upon condition of the master’s
                    instructing him in his art or mystery.</p>
                <p part="N">By the common law, every person is left at liberty to follow whatever
                    trade or employment may be agreeable to him. But as it was supposed that great
                    injury would result to the public if unqualified persons were to exercise the
                    various crafts and mysteries connected with the mechanical trades, it was
                    specially provided, by the 5th Eliz., that no person should exercise any art or
                    craft unless he had previously qualified himsclf for it by a regular
                    apprenticeship, under a penalty of L.400 for every month. Considerable doubts
                    were always entertained as to the trades to which this statute applied; and as
                    the courts of law do not seem generally to have favoured the principle of the
                    statute, their decisions tended rather to confine than to extend the
                    restriction. It was at length agreed that the law was only applicable to such
                    trades as existed at the time of passing the act, and to such also as implied
                    some mystery or craft. The operation of the statute was also held to be limited
                    to market-towns, it being supposed necessary for the convenience of the
                    inhabitants of country villages, that the same person should exercise different
                    trades, even though he had not been regularly bred by a seven years’
                    apprenticeship to each. These various limitations of the statute gave rise to
                    many very absurd distinctions, which plainly showed how very unsuitable this
                    antiquated law was to tĥe present advanced state of the mechanical trades. It
                    was found, for example, that a coachmaker could neither himself make nor employ
                    journeymen to make his coach-wheels, but that it behoved him to buy them of a
                    master wheelwright, this last trade having been exercised in England before the
                    5th Eliz. But a wheelwright, though he has never served an apprenticeship to a
                    coachmaker, might either himself make, or employ journeymen, to make coaches,
                    the trade of a coachmaker not having been prohibited by the statute, as not
                    being exercised in England at the time it was passed. All the great manufactures
                    which, in modern times, have arisen throughout England—in Manchester,
                    Birmingham, Sheffield, Wolverhampton—were on this account exempted from the
                    restrictive operation of this law; and the perfection to which they have arrived
                    seems a practical proof of its inutility for tĥe encouragement of trade.</p>
                <p part="N">The effects of those restrictions imposed by the 5th Eliz. were at
                    length felt to be so injurious, that, in the year 1813, petitions were presented
                    to parliament from various manufacturing towns for a repeal of certain parts of
                    this exceptionable statute; and the 54th Geo. HI. was accordingly passed, by
                    which all the penalties and prohibitions imposed by 5th Eliz. on those who
                    should exercise any trade or mystery, unless qualified by six or seven years’
                    apprenticeship, were repealed. That part of the statute was also repealed which
                    enacted that no person should become an apprentice except in strict conformity
                    to the provisions of the 5th Eliz., and which rendered all indentures contrary
                    to this act null and void. In opposition to this, it was provided that all
                    indentures or covenants which would otherwise be valid, should now be valid, any
                    thing in the 5th Eliz. to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
