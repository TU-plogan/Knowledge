                    whom he had three children. But Majorianus, in the year 475, having deprived
                    Avitus of the empire, and taken the city of Lyons, in which our author resided,
                    Apollinaris fell into the hands of the enemy. However, the reputation of his
                    learning softened Majorianus’s resentment, so that he treated him with the
                    utmost civility; in return for which Apollinaris composed a panegyric in his
                    honour, which was so highly applauded, that he had a statue erected to him at
                    Rome, and was honoured with the title of <hi rend="italic">Count.</hi> In the
                    year 467 the emperor Anthemius rewarded him for the panegyric which he had
                    written in honour of him, by raising him to the post of governor of Rome, and
                    afterwards to the dignity of a patrician and senator. But he soon quitted these
                    secular employments for the service of the church. The bishopric of Clermont
                    being vacant in 472 by the death of Eparchus, Apollinaris, who was then only a
                    layman, was chosen to succeed him. Clermont being besieged by the Goths, he
                    animated the people to the defence of that city, and would never consent to the
                    surrender of it; so that, when it was taken about the year 480, he was obliged
                    to retire; but he was soon restored by Evariges, king of the Goths, and
                    continued to govern the church as he had done before. He died on the 2lst of
                    August 487. He is esteemed one of the most elegant writers of his age, both in
                    prose and verse. His chief works are his <hi rend="italic">Panegyrics</hi> upon
                    the emperors Avitus, Majorianus, and Anthemius, and a collection of <hi
                        rend="italic">Letters</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Poems.</hi> The best
                    edition of these productions is that by Sirmond, published in 1614, and
                    republished by Labbe in 1652, in 4to. There is a French translation of his <hi
                        rend="italic">Letters.</hi></p>
