                <p part="N"><label type="entry">ANAXAGORAS</label>, an eminent philosopher of
                    antiquity, was born in the first year of the 70th Olympiad, or 500 years before
                    Christ. Leaving his lands to be cultivated and enjoyed by his friends,
                    Anaxagoras placed himself under the care of Anaximenes the Milesian. About the
                    age of twenty he went to Athens and entered upon the study of philosophy, where
                    he continued thirty years. Some suppose that he was the first disciple of the
                    Ionian school, founded by Thales, a teacher of philosophy in Athens. When
                    Anaxagoras assumed the character of a public teacher of philosophy, he quickly
                    rose to high eminenee, and produced many famous scholars, among whom were
                    Euripides, Pericles, and Socrates. This philosopher contented, himself with
                    serving the republic in his own station, without interfering in any of the
                    public affairs of the state. Both by the principles of wisdom which he inspired
                    into the minds of the Athenian youth, and also by his daily advice in the most
                    important affairs, particularly in the case of Pericles, he was of singular
                    service to his country. But neither the friendship of Pericles, nor his own
                    general disinterestedness of character, nor his immense stores of learning,
                    could ward off the shafts of persecution. Cleo accused him of impiety, and the
                    introduction of new opinions concerning the gods, because he taught that the sun
                    was a burning mass of stone, or an inanimate fiery substance. By this opinion he
                    was said to rob the sun of his divinity, because in the popular opinion he was
                    deemed Apollo, one of the greatest deities. But although Cleo made religion the
                    avowed cause of the accusation of Anaxagoras, it is highly probable that civil
                    causes chiefly operated towards his condemnation. It is, however, abundantly
                    evident that he did not hesitate to expose the vulgar superstitions on several
                    occasions; but the evidence is not sufficient which pretends to prove <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193096887?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6887-0102"
                    />that he was condemned for teaching the doctrine of a supreme intelligence, the
                    creator of this world. His judges condemned him to death; but Pericles appearing
                    in his defence, the sentence was changed from that of death to banishment and a
                    pecuniary fine.</p>
                <p part="N">Expelled from Athens, Anaxagoras passed the remainder of his days at
                    Lampsacus, teaching philosophy in the school of his deceased master Anaximenes,
                    until the infirmities of nature terminated his life in the year 428 before
                    Christ. Diogenes Laertius has collected, with little care and judgment, the
                    details concerning this philosopher, which were scattered through various
                    writings. It appears, that in the midst of some extravagant conceptions,
                    Anaxagoras held opinions which indicate a considerable acquaintance with the
                    laws of nature. His idea of the heavens seems to have been, that they were a
                    solid vault, originally composed of stones, elevated from the earth by the
                    violent motion of the ambient ether, inflamed by its heat, and by the circular
                    motion of the heavens fixed in their respective places. The testimonies of
                    several writers, among which is that of Xenophon, unite in proving that he
                    considered the sun to be a large fiery stone; and Xenophon introduces Socrates
                    as refuting that doctrine, and delivering an unfavourable opinion concerning his
                    other writings. From his perceiving that the rainbow is the effect of the
                    reflection of the solar rays from a dark cloud, and that wind is produced by the
                    rarefaction, and sound by the percussion, of the air, he seems to have paid
                    considerable attention to the phenomena of nature.</p>
                <p part="N">Our information is more correct concerning his opinions of the
                    principles of nature and the origin of things. He imagined that in nature there
                    are as many kinds of principles as there are species of compound bodies; and
                    that the peculiar form of the primary particles of which any body is composed is
                    the same with the quality of the compound body itself. For instance, he supposed
                    that a piece of gold is composed of small particles which are themselves gold,
                    and a bone of a great number of small bones: thus, according to Anaxagoras,
                    bodies of every kind are generated from similar particles. That part of his
                    system is more agreeable to reason which explains the active principle in
                    nature. According to Diogenes Laertius, Anaxagoras taught that “the, universe
                    consists of small bodies composed of similar parts, and that mind is the
                    beginning of motion.” “He was the first,” says the same writer, “who superadded
                    mind to matter, opening his work in this pleasing and sublime language: <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> All things were confused; then came mind and
                    disposed them in order.’” Plato informs us that this philosopher taught the
                    existence of a disposing mind, the cause of all things. Anaxagoras, according to
                    Aristotle, taught that mind was “the cause of the world, and of all order; and
                    that while all things else are compounded, this alone is pure and unmixed ;” and
                    that “he ascribes to this principle two powers—to know and „to move—saying that
                    mind put the universe in motion.” Cicero expressly asserts that Anaxagoras was
                    the first who taught that “the arrangement and order of all things was contrived
                    and accomplished by the understanding and power of an infinite mind.”</p>
