                    Scotland, within about two miles of Blair-Athole. It is formed by lofty
                    mountains impending over the river Garry, which rushes through in a deep channel
                    beneath. In the last century this pass was one of some danger and difficulty,
                    and a path hanging over a tremendous precipice threatened destruction at the
                    least false step of the traveller. At present it is traversed by a beautiful
                    road, forming part of the Highland line between Dunkeld and Inverness, and all
                    danger or even difficulty has completely vanished. The finest portion of the
                    pass is at the southern extremity, and <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:192947136?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7136-0718"/>nearly
                    opposite to the house of Faskally, which is situated on a level paddock at the
                    foot of the precipice, on the right bank of the Garry, which sweeps round the
                    beautiful green spot on which it stands.</p>
                <p part="N">Near the northern extremity of this pass, in its open and unimproved
                    state, was fought, in the year 1689, the battle of Killicrankie, between the
                    adherents of James II. under Viscount Dundee, and those of William III. under
                    General Mackay. Dundee’s army was inferior in numbers to that of Mackay. When he
                    came in sight of the latter, he found them formed in eight battalions ready for
                    action. They consisted of 4500 foot, and two troops of horse. The Highlanders
                    under Dundee amounted to little more than half that number. At five of the clock
                    in the afternoon, a kind of slight skirmish took place between the right wing of
                    the Highlanders and the left of the enemy. But neither army wishing to change
                    their ground, the firing was discontinued for three hours. Dundee in the mean
                    time passed from clan to clan, and animated them to action." About eight o’clock
                    he gave the signal for battle. The Highlanders in deep columns rushed suddenly
                    down the hill, reserving their fire until they were within a pike’s length of
                    the enemy; when, having discharged their muskets, they fell upon the red-coats
                    sword in hand. Mackay’s left wing, unable to sustain the shock, were driven by
                    the Macleans with great slaughter from the field. But the Macdonalds, on the
                    left of the Highlanders, were not equally successful. Colonel Hastings’s
                    regiment of foot stood their ground, and even forced the Macdonalds to recoil.
                    Maclean, however, with a few of his tribe, and Sir Evan Cameron at the head of
                    his clan, fell suddenly on the flank of this gallant regiment, and forced them
                    to give way. The slaughter ended not with the battle. Two thousand men fell in
                    the field and in the flight. The tents, baggage, artillery, and provisions of
                    the enemy, and even King William’s Dutch standard, horne by Mackay’s regiment,
                    fell into the hands of the conquerors. The victory was now complete. But the
                    Highlanders lost their gallant leader, who, as he was raising his arm, and
                    ordering the Camerons to advance, received a ball in his side. The wound proved
                    mortal; and with Dundee perished all the hopes of King James.</p>
                <p part="N">The battle of Killicrankie, or of Renrorie as the Highlanders call it,
                    was fought to the westward of the great pass, on a level space, in the form of a
                    small amphitheatre, immediately below the house of Urrarđ, and bounded on the
                    one side by the heights, on a terrace of which that house stands, and on the
                    other by the river Garry, which at this place runs close by the modern road. In
                    the middle of this little plain stands a rude block of stone, which is said to
                    mark the spot where Viscount Dundee received the wound which put a period to his
                    earthly career; but this is most probably a mistake; for, in the first place, if
                    he had descended to the level ground, he could not have commanded a full view of
                    the attack, whereas, by remaining at or near Urrard House, he must have
                    perceived at a glance every movement that took place in the plain below; and,
                    secondly, the tradition is uniform and uncontradicteđ, that he was mortally
                    wounded by a ball which entered between the joinings of his armour, whilst his
                    horse was stooping to drink at a well on the heights, and at the moment when he
                    was ordering the Camerons to advance. Before the onset, the Highland army was
                    drawn up on the face of the hill, a little above the house of Urrard; a position
                    which gave them the entire command of the pass, and enabled them to attack to
                    the greatest advantage.' As Mackay was observing his adversaries, on the hill
                    above, he turned round to young Locheil who stood next him, and pointing to the
                    Camerons, “There,” said he, “is your father and his wild savages; how would you
                    like to be with him ?” “It signifies little,” replied the other, “what <hi
                        rend="italic">I</hi> would like; but I recommend it to you to be prepared,
                    or perhaps my father and his wild savages may be nearer to you before night than
                        <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would like.” And it happened as young Cameron had
                    foreseen. Dundee delayed his attack until near sunset, “when,” according to an
                    eye-witness, “the Highlanders advanced on us like madmen, without shoes or
                    stockings, covering themselves from our fire with their targets. At last they
                    cast away their muskets, drew their broadswords, and advancing furiously upon
                    us, broke us, and obliged us to retreat; some fled to the water, some another
                        way.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">The
                            author of the Memoirs of Dundee, speaking of this battle, says, “Then
                            the Highlanders fired, threw down their fusils, rushed in with sword,
                            target, and pistol upon the enemy, who did not maintain their ground two
                            minutes after the Highlanders were amongst them; and I dare be bold to
                            say, there were never such strokes given in Europe as were given that
                            day by the Highlanders.” What follows seems to partake a little of the
                            marvellous. “Many of General Mackay’s officers and soldiers were cut
                            down through the skull and neck to the very breast; others had skulls
                            cut off above their ears like night-caps; some soldiers had both their
                            bodies and cross-belts cut through at one blow; pikes and small swords
                            were cut like willows; and whoever doubts of this may consult the
                            witnesses of the tragedy.” The whole, indeed, seems to have been, in
                            more senses than one, a very <hi rend="italic">cutting</hi>
                        affair.</p></note> In short, the charge was like a torrent, and the rout
                    immediate and complete. Some regiments, indeed, withstood the first onset, and
                    regaining their formation, made some show of resistance; but seeing themselves
                    at length turned and abandoned, they soon joined in the flight. It has generally
                    been believed that Dundee fell towards the close of the action; but a letter,
                    which has been preserved, from James VII. to Stewart of Balle-chin, who
                    commanded the Athole men, proves the reverse. " If their courage and yours, and
                    the rest of the commanders under you, were not steady,” says James, “the loss
                    you had in a general you loved and confided in, <hi rend="italic">at your
                        entrance into action,</hi> with so great inequality of numbers, were enough
                    to baffle you.” The consternation occasioned by the death of Dundee, however,
                    prevented an immediate pursuit through the great pass. Had the discomfited
                    troops been closely followed, and had a few Highlanders been placed at the
                    southern entrance, not a man of them would have escaped. His uninterrupted
                    retreat caused General Mackay to conclude that some misfortune had befallen
                    Dundee. “Certainly,” said he, “Dundee has been killed, or I should not thus be
                    permitted to retreat unmolested.” (Stewart’s <hi rend="italic">Sketches of the
                        Highlanders,</hi> vol. i. pp. 66, 67.)</p>
