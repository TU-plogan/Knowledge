                <p part="N"><label type="entry">KOOKIES</label>, a singular race of people, who
                    inhabit the mountains to the north-east of the Chittagong district, in the
                    province of Bengal. They are little known to the inhabitants of the plain, and
                    are seldom seen except when they visit the markets on the borders of the jungles
                    in the Rungancah and Aurungabad divisions, to purchase salt, dried fish, and
                    tobacco. The Kookies are a stout, muscular race, but not tall, and have the
                    peculiar Tartar features of the Asiatics in the east, namely, the flat nose,
                    small eye, and broad, round face. They are divided into a number of distinct
                    communities independent of each other, and are all hunters and warriors. Their
                    arms are bows and arrows, clubs and spears; and, by way of defence, they build
                    their villages, which generally contain from 500 to 2000 inhabitants, on the
                    most inaccessible hills. They are much addicted to war, in which they are almost
                    constantly engaged; and, like most savages, they prefer ambuscades and surprises
                    to regular battle. They are vindictive in their dispositions, and always shed
                    blood on a principle of retaliation. They use an intoxicating liquor distilled
                    from rice, which they drink at marriages, these being attended with much
                    feasting. They have an idea of rewards and punishments in a future state, and
                    they have also a saint or angel which they worship as the mediator between them
                    and the Deity. They have no regular priests, and the master of each family
                    instructs the children in the religious knowledge which he thinks necessary.
                    They sometimes engage in war with the Choomeas; but being in great dread of
                    fire-arms, they are quickly driven back to their native mountains. They are,
                    however, a great terror to the inhabitants on the borders of the Chittagong
                    district, especially to the wood-cutters, on whom they frequently make inroads.
                    They subsist partly by the chase: and they have no religious prejudice against
                    any animal. An elephant is considered as a great prize by them, as it affords so
                    great a quantity of food. Their domestic animals are gagals, goats, hogs, dogs,
                    and fowls.</p>
