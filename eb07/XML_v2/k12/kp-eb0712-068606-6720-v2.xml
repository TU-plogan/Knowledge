                    />Public Ledger, the Royal Chronicle, Owen’s Weekly Post, and some other
                    periodical publications, in which he wrote many original essays and pieces of
                    poetry, which extended his reputation, and procured the means of subsistence for
                    himself, his wife, and a growing family. For several years after this period, he
                    continued writing upon a variety of subjects, as the accidents of the times
                    chanced to call for the assistance of his pen; and he employed himself in
                    composing many pamphlets on the important questions then agitated, the greater
                    part of which are now buried in oblivion. Amongst these productions, was a
                    Vindication of Mr Pitt’s Administration, which Lord Chesterfield makes
                    honourable mention of in the second volume of his Letters. In 1767, the Babbler
                    appeared in two pocket volumes, which had at first been inserted in Owen’s
                    Weekly Chronicle, in single papers; as did also the Memoirs of a Magdalene,
                    under the title of Louisa Mildmay. About 1767, he was tempted, by the success of
                    Churchill’s Rosciad, to write sonic strictures on the performers of both
                    theatres, in two pamphlets, entitled Thespis, which gave great offence to some
                    of the principal persons at each house. The talents for satire which he
                    displayed in this work recommended him to the notice of Mr Garrick, who, in the
                    next year, caused his first play of False Delicacy to be acted at Drury Lane. It
                    was received with great applause; and from this time he continued to write for
                    the stage with profit and success, until the last period of his life. As his
                    reputation increased, he began to turn his thoughts to some mode of supporting
                    his family less precarious than by writing, and for that purpose entered himself
                    a member of the Middle Temple. After the. regular steps had been taken, he was
                    called to the bar in 1774, and his proficiency in the study of the law afforded
                    promising hopes that he might make a distinguished figure in that profession.
                    But his sedentary course of life had by this time injured his health, and
                    subjected him to much affliction. Early in 1777, an abscess formed in his side,
                    which, after a few days’ illness, put a period to his life. He was theauthor of
                    six plays besides that above mentioned.</p>
