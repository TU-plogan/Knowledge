                    Beloochistan, and thence called Kelat, or the city. Its situation is elevated on
                    the western side of a well-cultivated plain or valley, about eight miles in
                    length and two or three in breadth, the greater part of which is laid out in
                    gardens and other enclosures. The town is built in the form of an oblong square;
                    three sides of it are encompassed by a mud wall eighteen or twenty feet high,
                    flanked at intervals of 250 paces by bastions, which, as well as the wall
                    itself, are pierced with numberless loop-holes for matchlock men; but no cannon
                    are now mounted. The defence of the fourth side of the city is formed by the
                    western face of the hill on which it is built, being cut away perpendicularly.
                    There are within the walls 2500 houses, without the wall 1250. They are built of
                    half-burnt briek or wooden frames, and plastered over with mud or mortar; the
                    streets are broader than those of native towns, and have mostly a raised pathway
                    on either side for foot passengers, and an uncovered kennel in the centre, which
                    is a recipient for all filth, and dirt, and stagnant water. The upper stories of
                    the houses also stretching across the streets, render the part beneath them
                    gloomy and damp. The palace of the ehief of Kelat stands on the summit of the
                    hill on whieh the city is built. Viewed from the outside, it appears an
                    irregular heap of common mud buildings, with flat roofs, forming terraces,
                    protected by low parapet walls pierced with loop-holes. The quarter on which the
                    khan’s residence is erceted has been enclosed by a mud wall with bastions. The
                    bazar of Kclat is extensive, and well furnished with every kind of goods, and
                    with provisions of all sorts, which can be procured at a moderate rate. The town
                    is also supplied with delicious water, from a spring in the face of a hill on
                    the opposite side of the plain, whence it meanders through the centre of it. The
                    inhabitants of Kelat may be divided into four classes, namely, the Beloehes or
                    Brahooes, Hindus, Afghans, and Dehwars. The latter are the principal merchants
                    of the place, and are therefore encouraged by the ehief. Long. 67. 57. E. Lat.

                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Kelat,</hi> or the fortress, is a singular valley
                    in the province of Khorassan, in Persia, which extends, in a direction nearly
                    east and w est, from fifty to sixty miles in length, and from twelve to fifteen
                    in breadth, situated amongst the hills that divide the plain of Mushed from the
                    desert. It is surrounded by mountains so steep and difficult by nature as to be
                    almost impassable, and they have been rendered completely so by art. The rocks,
                    says Fraser, are scarped in the outside, presenting a mural appearance, so that
                    there is no possibility of sealing them; and beyond these is a lesser range,
                    with a hollow between, which the natives call the diteh. Not less care has been
                    taken in the inside to increase every natural difficulty, so as to render a
                    descent into or an escape from the valley equally impracticable. There are two
                    openings in this valley, one at the western and one at the eastern extremity.
                    These openings, whieh are both narrow and intricate, are called the <hi
                        rend="italic">gates</hi> of the fortress, and have been built up* and
                    fortified in sueh a manner that it is impossible to force an entrance. On these
                    fortified gateways there are towers where watchmen are continually posted to
                    give warning of all who approach, and none are admitted exeept those who have
                    passed from the end of the valley. In this valley there is a great deal of
                    cultivation, and its population amounts to 2000 families. It was in this
                    stronghold that Nadir Shah intended to deposit his vast treasure. Futeh Allee
                    Khan was placed in command of the fortress by Allee Shah, after the death of
                    Nadir, and was killed in a brawl which subsequently took place. His son
                    succeeded in putting the murderer to death, and he has ever since retained
                    possession of the fortress. He is an independent chieftain, possessed of 1000
                    horse and 2000 foot, and can considerably increase the number by arming his
                    villagers. As he is besides on good terms with the Toorkomans of the desert, he
                    can always command a large force of their cavalry.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Kelat,</hi> a town and strong fortress of
                    Afghanistan, in the province of Candahar. It was taken by the Emperor Baber in
                    the year 1506; but, upon the decline of the Mogul empire, it fell again into the
                    hands of the Afghans. Mr Foster, who passed it in 1783, describes it as a fort
                    situated on an eminence, surrounded by a desert country. It is sixty miles
                    east-north-east of the city of Candahar.</p>
