                <p part="N"><label type="entry">KENNET, <hi rend="smallcaps">White</hi></label>, a
                    learned English writer, and Bishop of Peterborough in the eighteenth century,
                    bred at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, where he soon distinguished himself by his
                    vigorous application to his studies, and by his translations of several works
                    into English, and other pieces which he published. In 1695 Kennet published his
                    Parochial Antiquities. But a sermon preached by him on the 30th of January 1703,
                    at Aidgate, exposed him to great clamour. It was printed under the title of <hi
                        rend="italic">A compassionate Inquiry into the Causes of the Civil War.</hi>
                    In 1706 he published his Case of Impropriations, and two other tracts upon the
                    same subject. In 1706 he brought forward the third volume of the Complete
                    History o. England, the two former volumes having been compiled by Mr Hughes. In
                    1709, he published a Vindication o. the Church and Clergy of England from some
                    reproaches rudely and unjustly cast upon them; and a true Answer to Dr
                    Sachevereľs Sermon. When the great point in Dr Sachevereľs trial, namely, the
                    change of the ministry, was gained, and strange proceedings took place upon it,
                    an artful address by the bishop and clergy of London was to be prepared, and
                    they who would not subscribe it were to be represented as enemies to the queen
                    and the ministry. Dr Kennet fell under this imputation. He was exposed to great
                    odium as a low churchman, on account of his conduct and writings. When he was
                    Dean of Peterborough, an uncommon method was taken to expose him by Dr Walton,
                    rector of the church of Whitechapel. In the altar-piece of that church, which
                    was intended to represent Christ and his twelve apostles eating the passover and
                    last supper, Judas the traitor was drawn sitting <pb break="no"

                    chair, dressed in a black garment, with a great deal of the air and appearance
                    of Dr Kennet. It was generally said that the original sketch was intended for a
                    bishop under Dr Walton’s displeasure; but the painter being apprehensive of an
                    action of <hi rend="italic">scandalum magnatum,</hi> leave was given to drop the
                    bishop and paint the dean, zks this gave general offence, however, the Bishop of
                    London ordered the picture to be taken down. In 1713 he presented the Society
                    for Propagating the Gospel with a great number of books suitable to their
                    design; published his <hi rend="italic">Bibliothecoe A mericanoe</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Primordia</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and founded an
                    antiquarian and historical library at Peterborough. In 1715 he published a
                    sermon entitled the Witchcraft of the present Rebellion, and afterwards several
                    other pieces. In 1717 he was engaged in a dispute with Dr William Nicholson,
                    bishop of Carlisle, relating to some alterations in a sermon by the Bishop of
                    Bangor; and he disliked the proceedings of the convocation against that bishop.
                    Upon the death of Dr Cumberland, bishop of Peterborough, he was promoted to that
                    see, to which he was consecrated in the year 1718. He sat in it more than ten
                    years, and died in 1728. He was an excellent philologist, a good preacher, and
                    well versed in the history and antiquities of our nation.</p>

                    chaplain to the English factory at Leghorn, where he met with great opposition
                    from the Papists, and was in danger from the inquisition. Kennet died in the
                    year 1714. He published Lives of the Greek poets, Roman Antiquities, a volume of
                    Sermons preached at Leghorn, and a translation into English of Puffendorf <hi
