                    most ancient of the confederation. It is bounded on one side by the dominions of
                    the grand duke of Baden, and on all other points by the Swiss cantons of
                    Schafhausen, Thurgau, St Gall, Schwytz, Zug, and Aargau. The whole extent of the
                    canton is about 640 square miles, including the lakes. The population, by a
                    census taken in the year 1837, was found to be 231,576 individuals, all of whom,
                    except 2000 Catholics, belonged to the Protestant reformed church.</p>
                <p part="N">The canton is purely of German origin, using only that language, but
                    with a strong patois among the country people. It contains six cities (so
                    denominated from being or having been fortified), eight market-towns, 149
                    communes, and 467 villages, with 26,400 houses. The education of the people is
                    carefully conducted. Besides a university in the capital, and several private
                    institutions, there are no less than 385 public schools, in which more than
                    55,000 children are instructed in the lower branches of learning. The contingent
                    of the canton towards the general defence of the confederation is fixed at 3700
                    men, and the annual payment of 74,000 francs. This canton is one of the
                    governing departments, and is therefore, alternately with Berne and Lucerne, the
                    residence of the diplomatic body, and of the persons engaged in the official
                    business of the confederation. The surface of the canton may be properly
                    described as an undulating succession of plains and hills of no great elevation,
                    except two ranges, whose highest peaks are about 2000 feet above the level of
                    the lakes, or about 3500 feet above the level of the sea. With the exception of
                    those peaks, the land is fertile and well cultivated; producing corn, wine,
                    fruits, and an abundant store of butter and cheese for the support of its own
                    dense population. The towns and villages contain a most industrious population,
                    chiefly employed in the manufacture of silk and cotton goods of a fine and
                    elegant texture, which are formidable rivals of the English and French fabrics
                    at the fairs of Frankfort and Leipzig, and in the cities of Germany. The rapid
                    streams afford a power by which some very extensive cotton and silk mills are
                    turned.</p>
                <p part="N">The most prominent feature in the face of the country is the lake of the
                    same name as the canton. It forms a kind of crescent from east to west. It is
                    about twenty-nine miles in length, and in breadth varies from three to four
                    miles. It is chiefly supplied with water from the river Linth, into which
                    descend the melted snows of the glaciers of Taede and Kistenberg. Though its
                    depth in many parts is 600 feet, yet, owing to shoals in other parts, it is only
                    navigable by vessels of a light draught of water, or by steamers, with which,
                    within the last three years, it has, like the other lakes of Switzerland, been
                    abundantly furnished. The lake in the hottest months is raised from ten to
                    fifteen feet by the more rapid melting of the ice on the glaciers. The lake of
                    Zürich is next to that of Geneva in extent; and, though destitute of the
                    grandeur of scenery of that and of the Wallenstadt and Lucerne lakes, its banks
                    exhibit the peculiar charm of rich and high cultivation.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Zurich,</hi> the capital city of this canton,
                    stands on the lake described in the preceding article, about 1270 feet above the
                    level of the sea, at the point where the beautifully translucent river Limmat
                    gushes out and passes under <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=1077"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0721-1077-1027"/>a very broad wooden bridge, which is the chief
                    marketplace. The city contains 14,500 inhabitants, who are industrious,
                    economical, and consequently thriving. They conduct considerable manufactories
                    of silk, linen, and cotton; and this is the focal point for the sale of the
                    goods prepared in the populous vicinity. A few years ago it might have been
                    described as a gloomy ill-built place, and by no means a clean one; but of late
                    the advance of wealth is abundantly shown in the great improvements which have
                    been and still are carrying on. This is especially remarkable near the lake, and
                    in the post-office and two hotels, one of which (the Bauer) is the largest and
                    most complete establishment in Switzerland, if not in Europe. The university was
                    only founded in 1823, and has never had many students. It was, in 1839, the
                    pretext or the cause of a revolution in the canton. Dr Strauss, a man of
                    learning, but the author of a work of infidel tendency, had been appointed
                    professor of divinity. There had been discontents for some time in the parts of
                    the canton without the city, against the municipality, who were the electors of
                    a disproportionate number of the legislative body. This election to the
                    professorship was made by that corporation, previously suspected of
                    antichristian principles; and the country people flew to arms, besieged and took
                    the city, displaced the municipality, ejected Strauss, and made alterations in
                    the elections to favour the anti-capital party. Tranquillity was restored, after
                    some lives had been lost; but how durable it may be, time must determine. The
                    markets are well supplied with fruit and vegetables, and tolerably well with
                    meat and poultry. Though the river and the lake furnish some fine fish, they are
                    high in price when compared with other articles of food. The city was fortified,
                    but is not kept in a very defensible state; some of its works having been formed
                    into most pleasing walks, with views over the lake, and the snowy tops of the
                    distant Alps in sight in the back-grounds. One of the defences of Zürich is the
                    lake itself, on which an attempt was made by the French in 1799 to attack the
                    city by water, on which occasion the inhabitants armed all the craft they could
                    collect for the defence, and placed the flotilla under the command of a British
                    naval officer of the name of Williams.</p>
