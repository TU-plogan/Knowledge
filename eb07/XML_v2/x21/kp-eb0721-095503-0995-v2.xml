                            >Francisco</hi></label>, a celebrated cardinal, was born at Torrelaguna,
                    in Old Castille, in 1437, and studied at Alcala and Salamanca. He then went to
                    Rome; and being robbed on the road, brought nothing back but a bull for
                    obtaining the first vacant prebend; but the archbishop of Toledo refused to
                    grant it, and threw him into prison. Being at length restored to liberty, he
                    obtained a benefice in the diocese of Siguença, where Cardinal Gonzales de
                    Mendoza, who was the bishop, made him his grand vicar. Ximenes some time after
                    entered among the Franciscans of Toledo; but being there troubled with visits,
                    he retired to a solitude named Castanei, and applied himself to the study of
                    divinity and the oriental tongues. At his return to Toledo, Queen Isabella of
                    Castille chose him for her confessor, and in 1495 nominated him archbishop of
                    Toledo, which, next to the papacy, is the richest dignity in the church of Rome.
                    “This honour,” says Dr Robertson, “he declined with a firmness which nothing but
                    the authoritative injunction of the pope was able to overcome. Nor did this
                    height of promotion change his manners. Though obliged to display in public that
                    magnificence which became his station, he himself retained his monastic
                    severity. Under his pontifical robes he constantly wore the coarse frock of St
                    Francis, the rents of which he used to patch with his own hands. He at no time
                    used linen, but was commonly clad in haircloth. He slept always in his habit,
                    most frequently on the floor or on boards, and rarely in a bed. He did not taste
                    any of the delicacies which appeared at his table, but satisfied himself with
                    that simple diet which the rule of his order prescribed. Notwithstanding these
                    peculiarities, so opposite to the manner of the world, he possessed a thorough
                    knowledge of its affairs, and discovered talents for business which rendered the
                    fame of his wisdom equal to that of his sanctity.”</p>
                <p part="N">His first care was to provide for the necessities of the poor; to visit
                    the churches and hospitals; to purge his diocese of usurers and places of
                    debauchery; to degrade corrupt judges, and place in their room persons whom he
                    knew to be distinguished by their probity and disinterestedness. He erected a
                    famous university at Alcala; andin 1499 founded the College of St Ildephonso.
                    Three years afterwards he undertook the Polyglott Bible; and in order to carry
                    on this great work, invited many learned men to Toledo, purchased seven copies
                    of the Old Testament in Hebrew for 4000 crowns, and gave a great price for Latin

                        >Biblia Sacra Polyglotta,</hi> &amp;c. Compluti, 1514-7, 6 tom. fol. The
                    edition was begun in 1502, and although completed in 1517, was not published
                    till 1522; the court of Rome having during that interval remained in suspense
                    whether it ought not to be entirely suppressed. The cardinal himself was but a
                    doubtful friend of sacred literature; for when it was proposed to translate the
                    Bible into Spanish, in order to convert the Saracens, he opposed it on the
                    ground that men might become Christians without reading the Bible. The
                    Complutensian or Alcala Polyglott contains in the first four volumes the Hebrew,
                    Greek, and Vulgate texts of the Old Testament in parallel columns; and the
                    Chaldee paraphrase at the bottom of the page, with a Latin translation. The
                    fifth volume contains the Greek text of the New Testament, with the Vulgate
                    version. The last contains a Hebrew and Chaldee vocabulary, a Hebrew grammar,
                    and a Greek dictionary. In this Polyglott appeared the first edition of the New
                    Testament in Greek.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1507, Pope Julius II. gave Ximenes a cardinal’s hat, and King
                    Ferdinand the Catholic intrusted him with the administration of affairs. He was
                    from this moment the soul of every thing that passed in Spain. He distinguished
                    himself at the beginning of his ministry by discharging the people from the
                    burdensome tax called <hi rend="italic">aeavale,</hi> which had been continued
                    on account of the war against Granada; and laboured with such zeal and success
                    in the conversion of the Mahommedans, that he made 3000 converts, among whom was
                    a prince of the blood of the kings of Granada. In 1509 Cardinal Ximenes extended
                    the dominions of Ferdinand, by taking the city of Oran, in the kingdom of
                    Algiers. He undertook this conquest at his own expense, and marched in person at
                    the head of the Spanish army, clothed in his pontifical ornaments, and
                    accompanied by a great number of ecclesiastics and monks. Some time after,
                    foreseeing an extraordinary scarcity, he erected public granaries at Toledo,
                    Alcala, and Torrelaguna, and had them filled with corn at his own expense; which
                    gained the people’s hearts to such a degree, that to preserve the memory of this
                    noble action they had an eulogium upon it cut on marble, in the hall of the
                    senate-house at Toledo, and in the market-place. King Ferdinand dying in 1516,
                    left Cardinal Ximenes regent of his dominions; and the archduke Charles, who was
                    afterwards the emperor Charles V., confirmed that nomination. The cardinal
                    immediately made a reform of the officers of the supreme council and of the
                    court, and put a stop to the oppression of the grandees. He vindicated the
                    rights of the people against the nobility; and as by the feudal constitution the
                    military power was lodged in the hands of the nobles, and men of inferior
                    condition were called into the field only as their vassals, a king with scanty
                    revenues depended on them in all his operations. From this state Ximenes
                    resolved to deliver the crown, and issued a proclamation, commanding every city
                    in Castille to inrol a certain number of its burgesses, and teach them military
                    discipline; he himself engaging to provide officers to command them at the
                    public expense. This was vigorously opposed by the nobles; but by his
                    intrepidity and superior address he carried his point. He then endeavoured to
                    diminish the possessions of the nobility, by reclaiming all the crown-lands, and
                    putting a stop to the pensions granted by the late King Ferdinand. This addition
                    made to the revenues enabled him to discharge all the debts of Ferdinand, and to
                    establish magazines of warlike stores. The nobles, alarmed at these repeated
                    attacks, uttered loud complaints; but before they proceeded to extremities,
                    appointed some grandees of the first rank to examine the powers in consequence
                    of which he exercised acts of such high authority. Ximenes received them with
                    cold civility; produced the testament of Ferdinand, by which he was appointed
                    regent, together with the ratification of that deed by Charles. To both these
                    they objected; and he endeavoured to establish their validity. As the
                    conversation grew warm, he led them insensibly to a balcony, from which they had
                    a view of a large body of troops under arms, and of a formidable train of
                    artillery. “Behold,” says he, pointing to these, and raising his voice, “the
                    powers which I have received from his Catholic majesty: with these I govern
                    Castille; and with these I will govern it, till the king, your master and mine,
                    takes possession of his kingdom.” A declaration so bold and haughty silenced
                    them, and astonished their associates. They saw that he was prepared for his
                    defence, and laid aside all thoughts of a general confederacy against his
                    administration. At length, from the repeated entreaties of Ximenes, and the
                    impatient murmurs of the Spanish ministry, Charles V. embarked and landed in
                    Spain, accompanied by his favourites. Ximenes was advancing to the coast to meet
                    him, but at Bos Equillos was seized with a violent disorder, which his followers
                    considered as the effects of poison. This accident obliging Ximenes to stop, he
                    wrote to the king, and with his usual boldness advised him to dismiss all the
                    strangers in his train, whose number and credit already gave offence to the
                    Spaniards; and earnestly desired to have an interview with him, that he might
                    inform him of the state of the nation, and the temper of his subjects. To
                    prevent this, not only the Flemings, but the Spanish grandees, employed all
                    their address to keep Charles at a distance from Aranda, the place to which the
                    cardinal had removed. His advice was now slighted and despised. Ximenes,
                    conscious of his own integrity and merit, expected a more grateful return from a
                    prince to whom he delivered a kingdom more flourishing than it had been in any
                    former age, and a more extensive authority than the most illustrious of his
                    ancestors had ever possessed; and lamented the fate of his country, about to be
                    ruined by the rapaciousness and insolence of foreign favourites. While his mind
                    was agitated by these passions, he received a letter from the king, in which,
                    after a few cold and formal expressions of regard, he was allowed to retire to
                    his diocese; and he expired a few hours after reading it, on the 8th of November
                    1517, and in the 81st year of his age.</p>
