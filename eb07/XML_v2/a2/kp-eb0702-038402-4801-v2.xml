                        Siegfred</hi></label>, a celebrated physician and anatomist, was born of an
                    illustrious family at Frankfort on the Oder in 1697. His father was then
                    professor of the practice of medicine in the university of Frankfort; but in the
                    year 1702 he repaired to Leyden, being nominated professor of anatomy and
                    surgery in that university. Here his son had an opportunity of studying under
                    the most eminent masters in Europe, who, from the singular abilities which he
                    then displayed, had no difficulty in prognosticating his future eminence. But
                    while he was distinguished in every branch of literature, his attention was
                    particularly turned to anatomy and surgery. His peculiar attachment to these
                    branches of knowledge gained him the intimate friendship of Ruysch and Rau, who
                    at that time flourished in Leyden; and the latter, so justly celebrated as a
                    lithotomist, is said to have seldom performed a capital operation without
                    inviting him to be present. Having finished his studies at Leyden, he went to
                    Paris, where he attended the lectures of Du Verney, Vaillant, and other
                    celebrated professors. But he had scarce spent a year there when he was invited
                    by the curators of the university of Leyden to be a lecturer on anatomy and
                    surgery at that place. Though contrary to his own inclination, he complied with
                    their request, and upon that occasion was created doctor of physic without any
                    examination. Soon after, upon the death of his father, he was appointed to
                    succeed him as professor of anatomy; and upon being admitted into that office on
                    the 9th of November 1721, he delivered an oration, <hi rend="italic">De vera via
                        adfabricae</hi><hi rend="italic">humani</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >corporis</hi><hi rend="italic">cognitionem ducente,</hi> which was heard
                    with universal approbation. In the capacity of a professor, hc not only bestowed
                    the greatest attention upon the instruction of the youth intrusted to his care,
                    but on the improvement of the medical art. With this view he published many
                    important discoveries of his own, and by elegant editions turned the attention
                    of physicians to works of merit, which might otherwise have been neglected. By
                    these means his fame was soon extended over Europe; and the societies of London,
                    Petersburg, and Haerlem, cheerfully received him as an associate. In 1745 he was
                    appointed professor of the practice of medicine at Leyden, and was succeeded in
                    the anatomical chair by his brother Frid. Bern. Albinus. He was twice rector of
                    the university, and as often he refused that high honour when it was voluntarily
                    offered him. At length, worn out by long service and intense study, he died on
                    the 9th of September 1770, in the 74th year of his age.</p>
