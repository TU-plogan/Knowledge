                    the bishopric of Worcester in the year 1046. He was so much in favour with King
                    Edward the Confessor, and had so much power over his mind, that he obliged him
                    to be reconciled with the worst of his enemies, particularly with Sweyn, son of
                    Earl Godwin, who had revolted against him, and came with an army to invade the
                    kingdom. Aldred also restored the union and friendship between King Edward and
                    Griffith, king of Wales. He took afterwards a journey to Rome, and being
                    returned into England, in the year 1054 he was sent ambassador to the emperor
                    Henry II. He staid a whole year in Germany, and was very honourably entertained
                    by Herman, archbishop of Cologne, from whom he learned many things relating to
                    ecclesiastical discipline, which on his return he established in his own
                    diocese. In the year 1058 he went to Jerusalem, which no archbishop or bishop of
                    England had ever done before him. Two years after, he returned to England; and
                    Kinsius, archbishop of York, dying the 22d of December 1060, Aldred was elected
                    in his stead on <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034931?mode=fullsize"

                    retain the see of Worcester with the archbishopric of York, as some of his
                    predecessors had done. Aldred went soon after to Rome, in order to receive the
                    pall from the pope: he was attended by Toston, earl of Northumberland, Giso,
                    bishop of Wells, and Walter, bishop of Hereford. The pope received Toston very
                    honourably, and made him sit by him in the synod which he held against the
                    simonists. •He granted to Giso and Walter their request, because they were
                    tolerably well learned, and not accused of simony. But Aldred being by his
                    answers found ignorant, and guilty of simony, the pope deprived him very
                    severely of all his honours and dignities, so that he was obliged to return
                    without the pall. On the way home he and .his three fellow-travellers were
                    attacked by some robbers, who took from them all that they had, though they did
                    not offer to kill them. This obliged them to return to Rome; •and the pope,
                    either out of compassion, or by the threat- enings of the earl of
                    Northumberland, gave Aldred the pallium; but he was obliged to resign his
                    bishopric of Worcester. However, as the archbishopric of York had been almost
                    entirely ruined by the many invasions of foreigners, King Edward gave the new
                    archbishop leave vθ keep 12 villages or manors which belonged to the bishopric
                    of Worcester. Edward the Confessor dying jn 1066, Aldred crowned Harold, his
                    successor. He also crowned William the Conqueror, after he had made him take the
                    following oath, viz. that he would protect the holy churches of God and their
                    leaders; that he would establish and observe righteous laws; that he would
                    entirely prohibit and suppress all rapines and unjust judgments. He was so much
                    in favour with the Conqueror, that this prince looked upon him as a father; and
                    though imperious in regard to every body else, he yet submitted to obey this
                    archbishop. John Brompton gives us an instance of the king’s submission, which
                    at the same time shows the prelate’s haughtiness. It happened one day as the
                    archbishop was at York, that the deputy-governor or lord-lieutenant, going out
                    of the city with a great number of people, met the archbishop’s servants, who
                    came to town with several horses and carts loaded with provisions. The governor
                    asked them to whom they belonged; and they having answered they were Aldred’s
                    servants, the governor ordered that all these provisions should be carried to
                    the king’s storehouse. The archbishop sent immediately some of his clergy to the
                    governor, commanding him to deliver the provisions, and to make satisfaction to
                    St Peter, and to him the saint’s vicar, for the injury he had done them; adding,
                    that if he refused to comply, the archbishop would make use of his apostolic
                    authority against him (intimating thereby that he would excommunicate him). The
                    governor, offended at this proud message, used the persons whom the archbishop
                    had sent him very ill, and returned an answer as haughty as the message was.
                    Aldred thereupon went to London to make his complaint to the king; but in this
                    very complaint he acted with his wonted insolence; for meeting the king in the
                    church of St Peter at Westminster, he spoke to him in these words: “Hearken, 0
                    William: when thou wast but a foreigner, and God, to punish the sins of this
                    nation, permitted thee to become master of it, after having shed a great deal of
                    blood, I consecrated thee, and put the crown upon thy head with blessings; but
                    now, because thou hast deserved it, I pronounce a curse over thee, instead of a
                    blessing, since thou art become the persecutor of God’s church, and of his
                    ministers, and hast broken the promises and the oaths which thou roadest to me
                    before St Peter’s altar.” The king, terrified at this discourse, fell upon his
                    knees, and humbly begged the prelate to tell him by what crime he had deserved
                    so severe a sentence. The noblemen who were present were enraged against the
                    archbishop, and loudly cried out he deserved death, or at least banishment, for
                    having offered such an injury to his sovereign; and they pressed him with
                    threatenings to raise the king from the ground. But the prelate, unmoved at all
                    this, answered calmly, “Good men, let him lie there, for he is not at Aldred’s
                    but at St Peter’s feet; he must feel St Peter’s power, since he dared to injure
                    his vicegerent.” Having thus reproved the nobles by his episcopal authority, he
                    vouchsafed to take the king by the hand, and to tell him the ground of his
                    complaint. The king humbly excused himself, by saying he had been ignorant of
                    the whole matter; and begged of the noblemen to entreat the prelate that he
                    might take off the curse he had pronounced, and to change it into a blessing.
                    Aldred was at last prevailed upon to favour the king thus far; but not without
                    the promise of several presents and favours, and only after the king had granted
                    him to take such a revenge on the governor as he thought fit. Since that time
                    (adds the historian) none of the noblemen ever dared to offer the least injury.
                    It may be questioned which was more surprising here, whether the archbishop’s
                    haughtiness, who dared to treat his sovereign after so unbecoming a manner, or
                    the king’s stupidity, who suffered such insolence and audaciousness from a
                    priest. The Danes having made an invasion in the north of England in the year
                    1068, under the conduct of Harold and Canute, the sons of King Sweyn, Aldred was
                    so much afflicted at it, that he died of grief the 11th of September in that
                    same year, having besought God that he might not see the desolation of his
                    church and country.</p>
