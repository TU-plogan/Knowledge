                    native of Greece, born in the city of Antioch. Having served several years in

                    in his expedition into Persia, but history is silent respecting any higher
                    military promotion than that which has already been mentioned. He was either in
                    the city or the vicinity of Antioch when the conspiracy of Theodorus was
                    discovered, under the reign of Valens, and was an eye-witness of the severe
                    torments to which many persons were exposed by the emperor on that account.</p>
                <p part="N">But his lasting reputation was not to be acquired from military
                    exertions. He left the army and retired to Rome, where he employed his time and
                    talents in writing the history of that empire during the period of three
                    centuries. Though a native of Greece, he wrote in the Latin language; but,
                    according to the remark of Vossius, his Latin shows that he was a Greek, and
                    also a soldier. His history begins with the reign of Nerva, and continues to the
                    death of Valens; and the work was originally divided into thirty-one books. Of
                    these the first thirteen have perished, and the eighteen which remain commence
                    with the seventeenth year of the reign of Constantius, and terminate at the year
                    375. But there are several facts mentioned in the history which prove that the
                    author was alive in the year 390. Of this number are the accession of Theodosius
                    to the eastern empire, the character of Gratian, and the consulate of
                    Neothorius. Similar to the manner in which Herodotus, the father of Grecian
                    history, read his history, Marcellinus read his books in public with general
                    approbation. Some have reckoned the style harsh and redundant, but this may
                    easily be excused, from his education and military life; and the valuable
                    information communicated abundantly compensates for that defect. Candour and
                    impartiality are leading features in his history. The character given him by Mr
                    Gibbon appears to be accurate, when he says that he is “an accurate and faithful
                    guide, who composed the history of his own times without indulging the
                    prejudices and passions which usually affect the mind of a contemporary.”</p>
                <p part="N">A difference of opinion has obtained, whether or not our historian was a
                    Christian or a pagan. But the respectful manner in which he speaks of pagan
                    deities, and of the advantage of heathen auguries to foretell future events,
                    renders it abundantly evident that he was a heathen. The favourable account
                    which he gives of the religion, manners, and fortitude of Christians, are the
                    result of his candour and impartiality as an historian. The work of Marcellinus
                    has passed through several editions, of which the best are the Leyden edition of
                    1693, and that of Leipsic, published in 1808.</p>
