                        >Midwifery,</hi> the premature exclusion of a foetus. It has sometimes been
                    doubted whether this unnatural practice was ranked as a crime in the laws of
                    Greece and Rome. This question has been revived, and elaborately discussed in
                    France, by some members of the Institute. The subject, it seems, had been
                    incidentally alluded to in a discourse of Gregoire’s ’ upon the influence of
                    Christianity on the condition of the female sex, read in the early part of 1814.
                    This produced two dissertations, one by Μ. Clavier, and the other by Μ.
                    Boissonade; the first maintaining the impunity of the practice among the
                    ancients, the last, that it was on the contrary viewed as a penal offence.</p>
                <p part="N">We find, says Μ. Clavier, that in one of Plato’s dialogues (<hi
                        rend="italic">Theaet.)</hi> Socrates is made to speak of artificial
                    abortion, as a practice not only common, but allowable; and Plato himself
                    authorizes it in his <hi rend="italic">Pepublic,</hi> (lib. v.) Aristotle <hi
                        rend="italic">(Polit,</hi> lib. vii. c. 17) gives it as his opinion, that no
                    child ought to be suffered to come into the world, the mother being above forty,
                    or the father above fifty-five years of age. Lysias maintained, in one of his
                    pleadings quoted by Harpocration, that forced abortion could not be considered
                    homicide, because a child <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">utero</hi>
                    was not an animal, or separate existence. Μ. Clavier admits, that, in a treatise
                    ascribed to Galen, <hi rend="italic">(An animal sit quod in</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">utero est ?)</hi> there is mention made of enactments by Solon
                    and Lycurgus against this crime; but he maintains that this is a spurious
                    production, and that, at any rate, his testimony cannot be opposed to that of so
                    many writers who lived long before his age. Among the Romans, Ovid <hi
                        rend="italic">(Amor.</hi> lib. ii.), Juvenal <hi rend="italic">(Sat.</hi>
                    vi. v. 594), and Seneca <hi rend="italic">(Consol, ad Helv.</hi> 16), though
                    they lament in strong terms the frequency of this enormity, yet they never
                    allude to any laws by which it might be suppressed. Various other writers, it is
                    said, preserve the same silence on this point, whilst joining in general
                    reprobation of the crime.</p>
                <p part="N">On the other hand, Μ. Boissonade appeals not only to the authority of
                    Galen, but of Cicero, <hi rend="italic">(Pro</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Cluentio,)</hi> as placing it beyond a doubt, that, so far from being
                    allowed to pass with impunity, the offence in question was sometimes punished
                    with death. With regard to the authority of Lysias, he states, that the pleading
                    referred to is quoted by Harpocration himself as of dubious authenticity; and,
                    as to Plato and Aristotle, he observes, that their speculative reasonings, in
                    matters of legislation, ought not to be confounded with the actual state of the
                    laws. And he adds, that Stobaeus <hi rend="italic">(Sernι.</hi> 73) has
                    preserved a passage from Musonius, in which that philosopher expressly states,
                    that the ancient lawgivers inflicted punishments on females who caused
                    themselves to abort.</p>
                <p part="N">It seems indeed difficult to believe, that the practice in question
                    should have been allowed to prevail without being denounced as criminal by the
                    lawgivers of Greece and Rome; but it is not so clear that there was any law
                    which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030329?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0702-0329-0040"/> punished it with death. Tłrose readers who
                    have any curiosity to enter more deeply into the inquiry, will be enabled to do
                    so by consulting the various authorities to which Μ. Clavier and M. Boissonade
                    have appealed, in support of their respective views of the question. The
                    notorious frequency of the practice forms an odious feature in the manners of
                    ancient times. Seneca makes it a ground of distinction for Helvia, that she had
                    never, like others of her countrywomen, destroyed the child in her womb, in
                    order to preserve her shape.</p>
                <p part="N">By the law of England till lately, the only party held to be guilty of
                    murder in forcingabor tion was the woman, when she was proved to have taken
                    means to destroy a child <hi rend="italic">quick</hi> in the womb, and actually
                    to have thereby destroyed it. But in 1803, an act was passed, inflicting the
                    punishment of death upon <hi rend="italic">all</hi> concerned in <hi
                        rend="italic">administering</hi> any noxious substance with the <hi
                        rend="italic">intent</hi> to procure the miscarriage of any woman <hi
                        rend="italic">quick</hi> with child. The procuring or attempting it before
                    the child has quickened, is punishable only with imprisonment or transportation.
                    This law is evidently grounded upon a false hypothesis, that the foetus is not
                    quick or alive till its motion in the womb becomes perceptible to the mother;
                    and, what is of more importance, it makes no provision against the attempt to
                    procure abortion by <hi rend="italic">manual</hi> application. The reader will
                    find a curious illustration of this defect, in a trial which occurred at the
                    assizes held at Bury St Edmunds in 1808. See <hi rend="italic">Trial of William
                        Fizzy,</hi> &amp;c. Ipswich, 1808.</p>
                <p part="N">The case of John Fenton, tried at Perth in 1763, was the first instance
                    of a criminal prosecution for this offence in Scotland; and here the public
                    prosecutor restricted the libel to an arbitrary punishment. Our writers indeed
                    agree, that, by the law of Scotland, the forcing of abortion is not homicide,
                    whether the child be quick or not, except where the mother is killed in the
                    process. Imprisonment or transportation may, and is all that can, in any case,
                    be inflicted.</p>
