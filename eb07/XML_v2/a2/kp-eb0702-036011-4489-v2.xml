                    predecessors in impiety and wickedness. He married Jezebel, the daughter of
                    Ethbaal, king of the Zidonians, who introduced the idols of Baal and Astarte
                    among the Israelites, and engaged Ahab in the worship of these false deities.
                    God, being provoked by the sins of Ahab, sent the prophet Elijah to him (1 Kings
                    xvii. 1, sey.), who declared to him that there would be a famine of three years’
                    continuance. The dearth having lasted three years, the prophet desired Ahab to
                    gather all the people to Mount Carmel, and with them the prophets of Baal: when
                    they were thus assembled, Elijah caused fire to descend from heaven upon his

                    then the earth recovered its former fertility. Six years after this, Ben-hadad,
                    king of Syria (chap, xx.), laid siege to Jerusalem. But God, provoked at this
                    proud Syrian, sent a prophet to Ahab, not only to assure him of victory, but to
                    instruct him likewise in what manner he was to obtain it. Ahab was ordered to
                    review the princes of the provinces, which he found to be a choice company,
                    consisting of 232 young men, who were to command the people in Samaria,
                    amounting to about 7000 men. With this small army Ahab was directed to fall upon
                    the great host of the Syrians, and that at noon-day, while Ben-hadad and the 32
                    kings that accompanied him were drinking and making merry. Ben-hadad having
                    notice that they were marching out of the city, ordered them to be brought
                    before him alive, whatever their designs were; but the young men, followed by
                    this small army, advanced, and killed all that opposed them. Such a panic seized
                    the Syrian troops, that they began to fly, and even Ben-hadad himself mounted
                    his horse and fled with his cavalry; which Ahab perceiving, pursued them, killed
                    great numbers <hi rend="italic">of</hi> them, and took a considerable booty.
                    After this the prophet came to Ahab, to animate him with fresh courage, and to
                    caution him to keep upon his guard, assuring him that Ben-hadad would return
                    against him the year following. According to this prediction, at the end of the
                    year he returned and encamped at Aphek, with a resolution to give the Israelites
                    battle. Both armies being ranged in order of battle for seven days successively,
                    at length, upon the seventh day, a battle ensued, wherein the Israelites killed
                    100,000 of the Syrians, and the reät fled to Aphek; but as they were pressing to
                    get into the city, the walls of Aphek fell upon them, and killed 27,000 more.
                    Ben-hadad throwing himself upon the mercy of Ahab, this prince received him into
                    his own chariot, and made an alliance with him. The year following, Ahab
                    desiring to make a kitchen-garden near his palace (chap xxi.), requested of one
                    Naboth, a citizen of Jezreel, that he would sell him his vineyard, because it
                    lay conveniently for him. But being refused, he returned in great discontentment
                    to his house, threw himself upon the bed, turned towards the wall, and would eat
                    nothing. Jezebel his wife coming in, asked the reason of his great concern, of
                    which being informed, she procured the death of Naboth, and Ahab took possession
                    of his vineyard. As he returned from Jezreel to Samaria, the prophet Elijah met
                    him, and said, “Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? Thus saith the
                    Lord, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, shall dogs lick thy
                    blood, even thine. As for Jezebel, of her the Lord spoke, saying, The dogs shall
                    eat Jezebel by the way of Jezreel.” Ahab, hearing these and other denunciations,
                    rent his clothes, put sackcloth upon his flesh, and gave -other indications of
                    his sorrow and repentance. But his repentance was neither sincere nor
                    persevering. Two years after these things, Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, came to
                    Samaria to visit Ahab (chap, xxii,), at a time when he was preparing to attack
                    Ramoth-gilead, which Ben-hadad, king of Syria, unjustly withheld from him. The
                    king of Israel invited Jehoshaphat to accompany him in this expedition, which
                    that prince agreed to do, but desired that some prophet might first be
                    consulted. Ahab therefore assembled the prophets of Baal, in number about 400,
                    who all concurred in exhorting the king to march resolutely against
                    Ramoth-gilead. But Micaiah, being also consulted at Jehoshaphat’s suggestion,
                    prophesied the ruin of Ahab. Upon this Ahab gave orders to lιis people to seize
                    Micaiah, and to carry him to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the
                    king’s son, telling him in his name, “Put this fellow in the prison, and feed
                    him with brea.d of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in
                    peace.” But Micaiah said, “If thou return at all in peace, the Lord hath not
                    spoken by me.” Ahab, therefore, and Jehoshaphat, marched up to Ramoth-gilead;
                    and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself, and enter
                    into the battle; but put thou on thy robes: for he knew that the king of Syria
                    had commanded two-and-thirty captains that had rule over his chariots, saying,
                    “Fight neither with small nor with great, save only with the king of Israel.”
                    These officers, therefore, having observed that Jehoshaphat was dressed in royal
                    robes, took him for the king of Israel, and fell upon him with great
                    impetuosity: but this prince seeing himself pressed so closely, cried out; and
                    the mistake being discovered, the captains of the king of Syria gave over
                    pursuing him. But one of the Syrian army shot a random arrow, which pierced the
                    heart of Ahab. The battle lasted the whole day, and Ahab continued in his
                    chariot with his face turned towards the Syrians. In the mean time his blood was
                    still issuing from his wound and falling into his chariot, and towards the
                    evening he died; whereupon proclamation was made, by the sound of trumpet, that
                    every man should return to his own city and country. The king of Israel being
                    dead, was earned to Samaria and buried; but his chariot and the reins of his
                    horses were washed in the fish-pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked his blood,
                    according to the word of the prophet. Such was the end of Ahab. His son Ahaziah
                    succeeded him in the year of the world 3107.</p>
