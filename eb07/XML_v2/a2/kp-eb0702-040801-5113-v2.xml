                        rend="italic">Scanderoon,</hi> a town in Syria, at the extremity of the
                    Mediterranean Sea. It is the port of Aleppo, from which it is distant 28 or 30
                    leagues. It is now, properly speaking, nothing but a village, without walls, in
                    which the tombs are more numerous than the houses, and which entirely owes its
                    existence to the road which it commands. This is the only road in all Syria
                    where vessels anchor on a solid bottom, without their cables being liable to
                    chafe; but in other respects it has many inconveniences. It is infested during
                    winter by a peculiar wind, called by the French sailors <hi rend="italic"
                        >le</hi><hi rend="italic">Raguier,</hi> which, rushing from the snowy
                    summits of the mountains, frequently forces ships to drag their anchors several
                    leagues; and when the snow begins to cover the mountains which surround the
                    gulf, tempestuous winds arise, which prevent vessels from entering for three or
                    four months together. The road also to Aleppo by the plain is infested by Curd
                    robbers, who conceal themselves in the neighbouring rocks, and frequently attack
                    and plunder the strongest caravans. But the worst circumstance is the extreme
                    unwholesomeness of the air, occasioned here by stagnant waters and mephitic
                    exhalations. It may be affirmed that this every year carries off one-third of
                    the crews of the vessels which remain here during the summer; nay, ships
                    frequently lose all their men in two months. The season for this epidemic
                    disorder is principally from May to the end of September: it is an intermitting
                    fever of the most malignant kind, and is accompanied with obstructions of the
                    liver, which terminate in dropsy. To this baneful epidemic, Alexandretta, from
                        <pb break="no" facs="nls:193035126?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0702-5126-0409"/>its situation, seems to be irremediably
                    condemned; for the plain on which the town is built is so low and flat, that the
                    rivulets, finding no declivity, can never reach the sea. When they are swelled
                    by the winter rains, the sea, likewise swelled by tempests, hinders their
                    discharging themselves into it; hence their waters, forced to spread themselves,
                    form lakes in the plain. On the approach of the summer the waters become
                    corrupted by the heat, exhale vapours equally corrupt, and which cannot
                    disperse, being confined by the mountains that encircle the gulf. The entrance
                    of the bay, besides, is to the west, which in those countries is the most
                    unhealthful exposure when it lies open to the sea. The labour necessary to
                    remedy this would be immense, and after all insufficient; and, indeed, such an
                    undertaking would be absolutely impossible under a government like that of the
                    Turks. Mr Volney informs us, that the merchants of Aleppo, disgusted with the
                    numerous inconveniences of Alexandretta, wished to abandon that port and carry
                    the trade to Latakia. They proposed to the pacha of Tripoli to repair the
                    harbour at their own expense, provided he would grant them an exemption from all
                    duties for ten years. To induce him to comply with their request, the agent then
                    employed talked much of the advantage which would <hi rend="italic">in time</hi>
                    result to the whole country. “But what signifies it to me what may happen <hi
                        rend="italic">in time</hi><hi rend="italic">?"</hi> replied the pacha; “I
                    was yesterday at Marach; to-morrow, perhaps, I shall be at Djedda. Why should I
                    deprive myself of present advantages, which are certain, for future benefits I
                    cannot hope to partake?” The European factors were obliged therefore to remain
                    at Scanderoon.</p>
