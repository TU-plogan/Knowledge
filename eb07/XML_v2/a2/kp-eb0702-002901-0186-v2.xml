                    in the north-east, between 56. 52. and 57. 42. north latitude, and between 1.
                    49. and 3. 48. of longitude west from Greenwich. It is bounded by the German
                    Ocean on the north and east; by the counties of Kincardine, Forfar, and Perth,
                    on the south; and by those of Inverness, Moray, and Banff, on the west. Its
                    greatest length is 85, arid breadth 40 miles; the bounding line being about 280
                    miles, of which 60 are on the sea-coast. By a careful measurement of
                    Arrowsmith’s map, it is found to contain 1960 square miles, an area equal to
                    1,254,400 English or 994,520 Scotch acres; of which somewhat more than one-third
                    is under cultivation. It contains 85 parishes, and is usually described under
                    five divisions. First, <hi rend="italic">Marr,</hi> which is a mountainous
                    district, particularly Braemar, the highland part of it; few of the bounding

                    above the level of the sea. Red deer are here found in great numbers, sometimes
                    300 in a flock; and moor game abounds in this as in all the more elevated parts
                    of the county. Second, <hi rend="italic">Formartin,</hi> of which the land on
                    the sea-coast is low and fertile; but hills and mosses are spread over the
                    interior. Third, <hi rend="italic">Euchan,</hi> the most extensive division next
                    to Marr, having a bold precipitous shore of 50 miles, but generally a flat
                    surface, the soil of which has been greatly improved of late by the cultivation
                    of turnips and clover. The Bullers of Buchan, about 6 miles south from
                    Peterhead, is a natural curiosity, which has been often described by tourists.
                    Fourth, <hi rend="italic">Garioch,</hi> a large and beautiful valley, naturally
                    very fertile. Before the introduction of modern husbandry, it was termed the
                    granary of Aberdeen. And, fifth, <hi rend="italic">Strathbogie,</hi> the greater
                    part of which consists of hills, mosses, and moors. On a comprehensive review,
                    it may be said, that, with the exception of the low grounds of Buchan, and the
                    highlands of the south-west division, Aberdeenshire consists for the most part
                    of tracks nearly level, but often bleak, naked, and unfertile, though
                    interspersed with many rich spots in a high state of cultivation. In extent, it
                    is very nearly one-sixteenth part of Scotland.</p>
                <p part="N">Aberdeenshire is not rich in mineral productions. No coal has been found
                    in it, and limestone, though it exists in many parts, is by no means abundant.
                    Slatè quarries are wrought to a small extent on the hill of Foudland, in the
                    Garioch division; manganese is found near Aberdeen; and black lead has been
                    discovered in the neighbourhood of Huntly. The mountains of Braemar contain
                    those precious stones called <hi rend="italic">Cairηgοηims</hi> by the country
                    people, who go thither in whole families to search for them during the summer
                    season; they are sold, sometimes at high prices, chiefly to the London
                    jewellers. But granite is the most abundant mineral, and has brought
                    considerable sums into the county, besides supplying the inhabitants with
                    excellent stones, for building and other purposes. As many stones have been
                    raised from an acre of land under preparation for tillage, as brought from L.30
                    to L.50, for paving the streets of London. The exportation of granite to the
                    capital employed at one time about 70 vessels of 7000 tons, and 400 men; and the
                    value of all the stones exported yearly was stated at L.40,000.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal rivers are the Dee and the Don. The gross annual produce
                    of the salmon-fisheries on these two rivers was estimated a few years ago at
                    nearly L.35,000. The Ythan and Ugic within the county, and the Deveron and Bogie
                    on its boundaries, are also considerable streams. Muscles are plentiful near the
                    mouth of the Ythan; and pearl muscles have been sometimes discovered at its
                    lower extremity. One of the jewels of the ancient crown of Scotland, a valuable
                    pearl, is said to have been found here.</p>
                <p part="N">There are also several lakes well stored with pike, trout, eels, and
                    other kinds of fish. The county is noted for its chalybeate springs at
                    Peterhead, Fraserburgh, and at Pananich on the Dee.</p>
                <p part="N">The climate of Aberdeenshire, except in the mountainous districts, is
                    rendered comparatively mild by its being bounded on two sides by the sea. The
                    winters are not so severe as in some of the southern counties, but the springs
                    are late, owing to the prevalence of easterly winds; and in autumn the weather
                    is often wet and stormy. Wheat, however, and all the other crops cultivated in
                    Scotland, come to perfection; and the inhabitants, who are not subject to any
                    local diseases, sometimes live to a great age.</p>
                <p part="N">The district of Marr, containing almost half the county, abounds in
                    natural woods, which are a source of wealth to their proprietors, and of
                    profitable employment to the inhabitants. This country is so well adapted to the
                    growth of trees, that it is only necessary to shut out the cattle by inclosures,
                    and the birds and winds supply it with seeds that soon rise into vigorous
                    plants. These woods consist chiefly of Scotch fir; and the timber, especially
                    what grows in the forests of Braemar, has been thought superior to any that
                    Scotland has imported from the north of Europe. About a tenth part of the whole
                    surface of the county is under wood; and the trees found in the peat mosses
                    indicate the existence of still more extensive forests in former ages.</p>
                <p part="N">Ruins of ancient edifices are seen in different parts of the county. In
                    the Garioch district, the vitrified fort called Dun-o-Deer, built on the summit
                    of a beautiful conical hill, which springs about 300 feet from its base, is
                    supposed to be 1000 years old; and is said to have been the residence of King
                    Gregory the Great (as he is called by the old Scotish historians), who died in
                    892. The ruins of two buildings, supposed to have belonged to Malcolm Kenmore,
                    who died in 1004, arc still pointed out. One of them, situate at Castletown of
                    Braemar, was his hunting seat; the other stands in a small island in Loch
                    Kanders, and must have been inaccessible, except when the lake was frozen. A
                    wooden bridge, which connected it with the land, has been found in the lake. The
                    castle of Kil-drummy, which in 1150 was the property of Daγid Earl of
                    Huntingdon, must have been a princely edifice, covering nearly an acre of
                    ground; and its venerable remains still show the power and grandeur of the
                    chieftains by whom it was inhabited. In the same district are some ancient
                    subterraneous retreats, supposed to have been used by the Picts as places of
                    refuge from an invading enemy.</p>
                <p part="N">The agriculture of Aberdeenshire has been considerably improved of late
                    years; potatoes, turnips, and clover, as well as wheat and other crops, arc now
                    cultivated according to the best courses of modern husbandry. Farms, however,
                    are still generally of a small size, compared with those of the south-eastern
                    counties; and the buildings, though gradually improving, are for the most part
                    much less convenient and comfortable. Here, as in every other part of Scotland,
                    a lease for nineteen years is the most common bond of connection between the
                    landholder and farmer; but it would appear that the covenants of leases are
                    still in a considerable degree dictated by feudal ideas.</p>
                <p part="N">In most parts of Aberdeenshire, cattle are a more important object to
                    the tenantry than corn; the number is stated at 110,000; and the sales, to
                    England and to the south of Scotland, amounting to about 12,000, were estimated
                    some years ago to bring L.150,000 annually. About two-thirds of the population
                    depend entirely on agriculture; oatmeal, prepared in different ways, with
                    potatoes, is the principal food of the labouring classes.</p>
                <p part="N">Besides the salmon-fisheries already noticed, the sea <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193030199?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0199-0030"/>fishing
                    employs a number of hands. The Greenland whale-fishery is carried on with great
                    success, by ships fitted out from Aberdeen and Peterhead. The whole fisheries
                    connected with the county are said to yield from L.80,000 to L.100,000
                    annually.</p>
                <p part="N">The old staple manufacture, the knitting of stockings, has declined
                    considerably for several years; but those in wool, cotton, and flax, are upon an
                    extensive scale, and employ a large proportion of the inhabitants. There are
                    also establishments for making sail-cloth, inkle, paper, &amp;c.; and, from the
                    characteristic ingenuity and enterprise of the people, Aberdeenshire may soon
                    assume a still higher rank among the manufacturing counties of Britain.</p>
                <p part="N">A share of our foreign trade, chiefly with the north of Europe, has been
                    long enjoyed by this county, and the ~ecent improvements on the harbour of
                    Aberdeen must contribute essentially to the extension of its commerce. There
                    were, in 1810, belonging to Aberdeen, Peterhead, and Newburgh, 207 vessels,
                    carrying 23,390 tons, and employing 1473 men. In 1807 a canal was opened from
                    the harbour of Aberdeen to the town of Inverury, a distance of 18½ miles, the
                    expense of which was about L.44,000. The facilities which this canal affords for
                    the conveyance of coal and lime have already proved highly beneficial to the
                    agriculture of the county.</p>

                <p part="N">Scots; but the <hi rend="italic">real rent</hi> for the lands and houses
                    is probably not less than L.300,000 sterling.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal seats in Aberdeenshire are, Aboyne Castle, the Earl of
                    Aboyne; Ellon Castle and Haddo House, the Earl of Aberdeen; Huntly Lodge, the
                    Duke of Gordon; Keith Hall, the Earl of Kintore; Marr Lodge, the Earl of Fife;
                    Philorth House, Lord Saltoun; Pitfour, Ferguson; Castle Forbes, Lord Forbes;
                    Skene House, Skene; Slaines Castle, the Earl of Errol. The prevailing names
                    among the proprietors are, Gordon, Forbes, Grant, Fraser, Duff, and Ferguson.
                    The county sends one member to parliament, and its three royal boroughs,
                    Aberdeen, Kintore, and Inverury, have a share in the election of other two;
                    Aberdeen, with other four boroughs in the adjoining counties, returning one, and
                    Kintore and Inver - ury, along with other three, another member.</p>
                <p part="N">In the returns made under the population acts, the county is divided
                    into eight districts, viz. Aberdeen, Alford, Deer or Buchan, Ellon, Garioch,
                    Kincardine O’Neil, Strathbogie, and Turreff. The following table shows the
                    number of inhabitants at each of the three census made under these acts. In
                    this, as in the other maritime counties of the north, there is a considerable
                    disproportion between the number of the sexes. The increase from 1801 to 1811,
                    is at the rate of 9½ per cent.; from 1811 to 1821, 15; and from 1801 to 1821,
                    26½ per cent.</p>
