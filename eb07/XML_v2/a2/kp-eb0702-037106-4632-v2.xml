                <p part="N"><label type="entry">ALABAMA</label>, a state and constituent member of
                    the North American republic. It is bounded by Florida and the Gùlf of Mexico on
                    the south, the state of Mississippi on the west, Tennessee on the north, and
                    Georgia on the cast. Its length is 275 miles, breadth 185, and area 50,800
                    square miles. The couιltry, to the extent of more than 100 miles from the coast,
                    consists of uneven lands, of a poor sandy soil, bearing little except pines, but
                    interspersed with marshes and alluvial tracts on the sides of the streams, which
                    are extremely fertile. Higher up, the country becomes fertile and beautiful, and
                    it bears that aspect as far as the mountains occupying the northern part of the
                    state. These mountains are about. 50 miles in breadth, and are supposed to
                    exceed 1500 feet in height, but have peaks rising much higher. They are covered
                    with a stony soil·, but on their southern side are many rich and beautiful
                    valleys, clothed with forests'of oak, hickery, walnut, gum, and maple. Under the
                    surface are mines of iron-ore. The climate is very hot in the parts below the
                    latitude of 32½, but comparatively temperate in the upper districts. At Fort
                    Stodart, in latitude 31. the mean heat by day was 84° Or 86° in July, and from
                    43° to 79° in February. The principal river in the state is the Alabama, which
                    is formed of two branches,’the Tombeckbee, and the proper Alabama. The former
                    rises in the state of</p>
                <p part="N">Mississippi, and after being joined by several streams, joins the
                    Alabama at Fort Stodart. The Coosa and Tala-poosa rivers united, compose the
                    proper Alabama, which, after being joined by the Tombeckbee, falls into the Gulf
                    of Mobile at the latitude of 30½. All these rivers are navigable to a great
                    distance from the sea. Steam-boats ply on the Alabama as far up as Montgomery,
                    which is nearly 400 miles by water from Mobile Bay, but only 150 by land. The
                    great employment of the people is agriculture. The soil yields wheat, maize,
                    rye, barley, oats, and rice, and sugar-canes; but the principal object of
                    culture is cotton, of which the state exports large quantities. The imports in
                    1824 amounted to 91,000 dollars, and the exports to 460,000. The number of
                    inhabitants in 1820 was 127,901, of whom 41,859 were slaves,’and 571 free
                    blacks. In January 1828 it was estimated at 254,000, including 93,000 slaves.
                    This is exclusive of the Creek Indians, who were estimated at 20,000 in 1818. A
                    great portion of the population consists of emigrants from Georgia. Cahawba, a
                    small place, is the seat of government; but the only considerable town in the
                    state is Mobile, which is situated on the west side of the bay of the same name,
                    30 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, and, in 1826, contained 5000 inhabitants. In
                    1816 some exiles from France re-cèived a grant of lands on the banks of the
                    Tombeckbee, in this state, with the view of introducing the culture of the vine;
                    but the project <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> did not succeed, and the new
                    settlemeht, named Demopolis, was abandoned in a few years. Alabama has very few
                    made roads, and no canals, but by means of its numerous rivers it enjoys a great
                    extent of inland navigation; and Mobile, the great centre of its trade, now
                    communicates by steam-boats with all the considerable places on the Tombeckbee
                    and Alabama rivers, and by sea with New Orleans. Alabama was admitted to the
                    rank of a state and member of the American union in 1819. Its government is
                    vested in a house of representatives elected annually, a senate elected
                    triennial-ly and renewed by thirds, and a governor elected for two years. The
                    right of suffrage belongs to every white citizen of full age. The judges in this
                    state hold their offices during good behaviour. Owing to the thinness of the
                    population, education is yet in a backward state; but as a fund for its
                    promotion, 640 acres of land are set apart in each township. In 1827 the public
                    revenue amounted to 67,000 dollars, and the expenditure to 82,000. The country
                    is healthful, except in the neighbourhood of wet grounds; and, upon the whole,
                    Alabama possesses advantages over some of the other southern states, and is one
                    of the most prosperous and rapidly progressive in that part of the union.
