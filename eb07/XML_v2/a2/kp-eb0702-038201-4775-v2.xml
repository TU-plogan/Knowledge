                        History,</hi> a sect or party of reformers, about Toulouse and Albigeois, in
                    Languedoc, who sprung up in the 12th century, and distinguished themselves by
                    their opposition to the discipline and ceremonies of the Romish church.</p>
                <p part="N">This sect had their name, it is supposed, either by reason there were
                    great numbers of them in the diocese of Albi, or because they were condemned by
                    a council held in that city. In effect, it does not appear that they were known
                    by this name before the holding of that council. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Albigenses</hi> were also called <hi rend="italic">Albiani,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Albigesei,</hi><hi rend="italic">Albii,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Albanenses,</hi> though some distinguish these last from them.
                    Other names given to them are <hi rend="italic">Heηricians, Abelardists,
                        Bulgarians,</hi> &amp;c.; some on account of the qualities they assumed;
                    others on that of the country from whence it is pretended they were derived; and
                    others on account of persons of note who adopted their cause, as Peter de Brius,
                    Arnold de Bresse, Abelard, Henry, &amp;c. Bcrengarius, if not Wickliffe himself,
                    is by some ranked in the number. The <hi rend="italic">Albigenses</hi> are
                    frequently confounded with the <hi rend="italic">Waldenses</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >;</hi> from whom, however, they differ in many respects, both as being
                    prior to them in point of time, as having their origin in a different country,
                    and as being charged with divers heresies, particularly Manicheism, from whence
                    the <hi rend="italic">Waldenses</hi> are exempt. But several Protestant writers
                    have vindicated them from that imputation. Dr Allix shows that a great number of
                        <hi rend="italic">Manichees</hi> did spread over the western countries from
                    Bulgaria, and settled in Italy, Languedoc, and other places, where there were
                    also <hi rend="italic">Albigenses</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> by which means,
                    being both under the imputation of <hi rend="italic">heresy,</hi> they came,
                    either by ignorance or malice, to be confounded, and called by the same common
                    name, though in reality entirely different.</p>
                <p part="N">Other errors imputed to them by their opponents, the monks of those
                    days, were, that they admitted two Christs; one evil, who appeared on earth; the
                    other good, who has not yet appeared: that they denied the resurrection of the
                    body, and maintained human souls to be demons imprisoned in our bodies, by way
                    of punishment for their sins: that they condemned all the sacraments of the
                    church, rejected baptism as useless, held the eucharist in abhorrence, excluded
                    the use of confessions and penance, maintained marriage unlawful, laughed at
                    purgatory, prayers for the dead, images, crucifixes, &amp;c. There were likewise
                    said to be two classes of them, the Perfect and the Believers. The perfect
                    boasted of their living in continence, of eating neither flesh, eggs, nor
                    cheese. The believers lived like other men, and were even loose in their morals;
                    but they were persuaded they should be saved by the faith of the perfect, and
                    that none were damned who received imposition of hands from them. But from these
                    charges also they are generally acquitted by Protestants, who consider them as
                    the pious inventions of the Romish church, whose members deem it meritorious by
                    any means to blacken heretics.</p>
                <p part="N">. However this be, the Albigenses grew so formidable, that the Catholics
                    agreed upon a holy league or crusade against them. They were at first supported
                    by Raymond, count of Toulouse· Pope Innocent III., desirous to put a stop to
                    their progress, sent a legate into their country; which failing, he stirred up
                    Phil ip Augustus, king of France, and the other princes and great men of the
                    kingdom, to make war upon them. Upon this the count of Toulouse, who had sided
                    with them, made his submission to the pope, and went over to the Catholics; but
                    soon after, finding himself plundered by -the crusaders, he declared war against
                    them, and was joined by the king of Arragon. His army was defeated at the siege
                    of Muret, where he himself was killed, and the defeat followed by the surrender
                    of the city of Toulouse, and the conquest of the greater part of Languedoc and
                    Provence. His son Raymond succeeded him, who agreed with the king and the pope
                    to set up the inquisition in his estates, and to extirpate the Albigenses. In an
                    assembly held at Milan; the archbishop of Toulouse drew up articles, agreeably
                    to which the count made a most ample declaration against them, which he
                    published at Toulouse in 1253. From this-time the Albigenses dwindled by little
                    and little, till the time of the Reformation, when such of them as were left
                    fell in with the Vaudois, and became conformable to the doctrine of Zuinglius
                    and the discipline of Geneva.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Albigenses</hi> is also a name sometimes given to
                    the followers of Peter Vaud or Waldo, and hence synonymous with what we more
                    properly call <hi rend="italic">Waldenses,</hi> or Poor Men of Lyons. In this
                    sense the word is applied by Camerarius, Thuanus, and several other writers. The
                    reason seems to be, that the two parties agreed in their opposition to the papal
                    innovations and encroachments, though in divers other respects said to be
                    different enough. The bishop of Meaux labours hard to support a distinction
                    between the two sects, alleging that the <hi rend="italic">Albigenses</hi> were
                    heretics and Manichees; whereas the <hi rend="italic">Waldenses</hi> were only
                    schismatics, not heretics; being sound as to articles of faith, and only
                    separating from the church of Rome on account of forms and discipline. Dr Allix
                    endeavours to set aside the distinction, and shows that both of them held the
                    same opinions, and were equally condemned and held for heretics; and this not
                    for points of faith, but for declaiming against the papal tyranny and idolatry,
                    and holding the pope to be the Antichrist; which last, according to Μ. de Meaux,
                    constitutes nothing less than Manicheism. In this sense, the Lollards and
                    Wickliffites in England were not only Albigenses, but Manichees.</p>
