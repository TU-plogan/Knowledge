                    troops whose duty it was to attend on the person of the sultan. The death of
                    Lazarus, despot of Servia, who had endeavoured in vain to stop the progress of
                    Amurath’s arms, touched Milo, one of his servants, in so sensible a manner,
                    that, in revenge, he stabbed the sultan in the midst of his troops, and killed
                    him upon the spot, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 1389, after he bad reigned 23
                    years.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps"/><hi rend="smallcaps">Amurath</hi> IL, the 10th
                    emperor of the Turks, was the eldest son of Mahomet I., and succeeded his father
                    in 1421. He besieged Constantinople and Belgrade without success; but he took
                    Thessalonica from the Venetians, and compelled the prince of Bosnia, and John
                    Castriot, prince of Albania, to pay him tribute. He obliged the latter to send
                    his three sons as hostages, among whom was George, celebrated in history by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Sean-derbeg.</hi> John Hunniades defeated Amurath’s
                    troops, and obliged him to make peace with the Christian princes in 1442. These
                    princes afterwards breaking the peace, Amurath defeated them in the famous
                    battle of Varna, November 10, 1444, which proved so fatal to the Christians, and
                    in which Ladislaus king of Hungary was killed. He afterwards defeated Hunniades,
                    and killed above 20,000 of -his men; but George Castriot, better known by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Seanderbeg,</hi> being re-established in the estates
                    of his father, defeated the Turks several times, and obliged Amurath to raise
                    the siege of Croia, the capital of Albania. Amurath died, chagrined with his ill
                    success, and infirm with age, February 11, 1451, at Adrianople. It is observed
                    to this prince’s honour, that he always kept his treaties with the greatest
                    fidelity.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Amurath</hi> IV., surnamed the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Valiant,</hi> was the son of Achmet I., and in the year 1622, at the age of
                    13, succeeded his uncle Mustapha. Bagdad fell into the hands of the Persians,
                    and several other disastrous events clouded the commencement of his reign. The
                    recovery of Bagdad being a favourite object, in the year 1637 he marched against
                    it; and after thirty days of unremitting assault, with the expense of much
                    blood, he took possession of the city. By pushing his men forward to the attack
                    by the point of the scimitar, and by slaughtering 30,000 Persians in cold blood
                    after their surrender, he displayed the brutal ferocity of his disposition. One
                    person alone is reported to have moved his obdurate heart on the present
                    occasion. A famous player upon the harp entreated those who were sent to
                    massacre him to allow him to speak to the sultan previous to his death. Informed
                    who he was, the sultan requested him to give a specimen of his skill in his
                    profession: with this he readily complied, and touched his harp so melodiously,
                    and sung in such pathetic strains the lamentations on the tragedy of Bagdad,
                    intermixed with the praises of Amurath, that the hard heart of the cruel monarch
                    being at length softened, he melted into tears, and saved both the musician and
                    the remaining inhabitants.</p>
                <p part="N">The violence of Amurath soon enfeebled his constitution; and the fruits
                    of his debaucheries and excesses were obvious even in the prime of life. At the
                    age of 31 he fell a victim to an excess of revelling in the feast of Bairam, in
                    the year 1640.</p>
