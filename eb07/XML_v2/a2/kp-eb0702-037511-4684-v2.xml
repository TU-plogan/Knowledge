                    celebrated painter, born in Bologna, March 17. 1578. His father was a silk
                    merchant, and intended to bring up his son to that business; but Albani, having
                    a strong inclination to painting, when his father died, devoted himself entirely
                    to that art, though then but twelve years of age. He first studied under Denys
                    Calvert, Guido Reni being at the same time under this master, with whom Albani
                    contracted a very great friendship. Calvert drew but one profile for Albani, and
                    afterwards left him entirely to the care of Guido, under whom he made great
                    improvement, his fellow-discipleinstructing him with the utmost humanity and
                    good-humour. He followed Guido to the school of the Caracci; but a little after,
                    their friendship for each other began to cool, which was »wing perhaps to the
                    pride of Albani, who could not bear to see Guido surpass him, or to the jealousy
                    of Guido at finding Albani make such rapid progress. They certainly endeavoured
                    to eclipse one another; for when Guido had set up a beautiful altar-piece,
                    Albani would oppose to it some fine picture of his. Thus did they behave for
                    some time, and yet spoke of each other with the highest esteem. Albani, after
                    having greatly improved himself under the Caracci, went to Rome, where he
                    continued many years, and married in that city; but his wife dying in childbed,
                    at the earnest request of his relations he returned to Bologna, where he entered
                    again into the state of matrimony. His second wife (Doralice) was well
                    descended, but had very little fortune; which he perfectly disregarded, so
                    -strongly was he captivated with her beauty and good sense. Albani, besides the
                    satisfaction of possessing an accomplished wife, reaped likewise the advantage
                    of having a most beautiful model; so that he had now no occasion to make use of
                    any other woman to paint a Venus, the Graces, •Nymphs, and other deities, whom
                    he took a particular de- .light in representing. His wife answered this purpose
                    admirably well; for besides her bloom of youth, and the beauty of her person, he
                    discovered in her so much modesty, so many graces and perfections, so well
                    adapted to painting, that it was impossible for him to meet with a more finished
                    woman. She afterwards brought him several boys, all extremely beautiful and
                    finely proportioned; so that she and her children were the originals of his most
                    agreeable and graceful compositions. Doralice was so conformable to his
                    intentions, that she took a pleasure in setting the children in different
                    attitudes, holding them naked, and sometimes suspended by strings, when Albani
                    would draw them in a thousand different ways. It was from them, too, that the
                    famous sculptors Flamand and Argaldi modelled their little Cupids.</p>
                <p part="N">Albani was of a happy temper and disposition; his paintings, says
                    Malvasia, breathing nothing but content and joy. Happy in a force of mind that
                    conquered every uneasiness, his poetical pencil carried him through the most
                    agreeable gardens to Paphos and Cythera; those delightful scenes brought him
                    over the lofty Parnassus to the delicious abodes of Apollo and the Muses: whence
                    what Du Fresnoy says of the famous Giulio Romano may be justly applied to Albani

                    and the whole city of Bologna. Malvasia has preserved some verses of Francisco
                    de Lemene, intended for his monument; the sense whèreof is, “that the mortal
                    remains of the illustrious Albani, he who gave life to shade, lie interred in
                    this tomb. The earth never produced so wonderful an artist, nor a hand equal to
                    bis im mortal one, which gave colour to the soul, and a soul to colours.
                    Prometheus animated clay, and gave life by means of the sun; but Albani animated
                    merely by the assistance of shade.” He was very famous in his lifetime, and had
                    been visited by the greatest painters. Several princes honoured him with
                    letters; and amongst the rest King Charles I., who invited him to England by a
                    letter signed with his own hand.</p>
