                    French Protestant divine, was born at Alençon in France, in the year 1641. He
                    became a learned divine of the English church, and a strenuous defender of the
                    Protestant faith. At the time when the edict of Nantes tolerated and protected
                    the Protestants of France, he entered upon his clerical profession, and remained
                    minister of Rouen until the 35th year of his age. In this period he wrote
                    several pieces upon the controversy between the Papists and the Protestants,
                    which obtained him great fame among his own party. He removed to Charenton in
                    the vicinity of Paris, which was the principal church among the reformed, and
                    frequented by persons of the first rank in France who professed the Protestant
                    faith. Here Allix preached a course of excellent sermons in defence of the
                    Protestant religion, some of which were afterwards printed in Holland, and added
                    to his increasing fame. The chief object of these sermons was to repel the
                    attack of the bishop of Meaux, the most ingenious and able opponent of the
                    Reformation at that time. The unwise revocation of the edict of Nantes drove
                    Allix and many others to seek refuge in England. Three years after his arrival
                    in England, he had made himself so perfectly master of the English language, as
                    to be able to write very correctly a <hi rend="italic">Defence of the Christian
                        Religion.</hi> This work he dedicated to James II. in testimony of gratitude
                    for his kind reception of the distressed refugees of France. Not long after his
                    arrival in England he was honoured with the title of doctor of divinity, and
                    also received the more substantial honour of being appointed treasurer of the
                    church of Salisbury. Aļlix still maintained the station of a champion for the
                    Protestant cause, and in opposition to the bishop of Meaux proved that the
                    charge of heresy justly belonged to the Papists, and not to their opponents,
                    because they had introduced new doctrines into the church.</p>
                <p part="N">After having with much industry and learning exercised his talents in
                    defence of Protestantism, he employed his pen to support the doctrine of the
                    Trinity against the Unitarians, who contended that the idea of Christ’s divinity
                    could be traced up no higher than the time of Justin Martyr. With a great
                    display of erudition, he attempted to prove that the Trinitarian doctrine was
                    believed by the Jewish church. But the reputation which he had acquired for
                    learning and ability was somewhat diminished, by the ridicule which he brought
                    upon himself in attempting to fix the precise time of Christ’s second coming to
                    the year 1720, or, at the very latest, to the year 1736. He died at London in
                    the year 1717, after his studious life had been protracted to the length of 76
                    years.</p>
