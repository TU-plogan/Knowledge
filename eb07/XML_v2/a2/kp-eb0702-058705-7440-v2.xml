                    his father Joash in the 25th year of his age. At the commencement of his reign
                    hc showed some reverence for the divine authority, but, in the language of
                    Scripture, “not with a perfect heart.” He speedily inflicted capital punishment
                    on the murderers of his father; but from respect to the law of Moses he spared
                    their families, an extension of clemency not very common in those times. He gave
                    early proof of his military spirit, by collecting a numerous army to attack the
                    Edomites. This force was composed not only of all his own subjects capable of
                    bearing arms, but of a powerful body of auxiliaries hired from the children of
                    Israel. By the advice of a prophet, however, the Israelites, amounting to
                    100,000 men, were dismissed, and lie prosecuted his enterprise with the
                    remainder of his army. Having engaged the Edomites in the valley of Salt, he
                    defeated them with a loss of 10,000 men, and following up his victory, he made
                    himself master of Selah, their metropolis. He also possessed himself of the
                    enemy’s idols, and impiously made them the objects of his adoration. Meanwhile
                    the Israelites, whom he had discharged, either offended by their dismissal, or
                    disappointed of their hope of plunder, turned their arms against the kingdom of
                    Judah, and plundered many of the cities. Amaziah, elated by his success, sent a
                    hostile challenge to Joash, king of Israel, to which Joash contemptuously
                    replied in a fable. (2 Kings, xiv. 9.) Indignant at the insult, Amaziah
                    immediately took the field, and encountering the Israelites at Bethshemesh, was
                    defeated and taken prisoner. After his victory, Joash proceeded to Jerusalem,
                    carrying along with him his vanquished enemy; and having broken down part of the
                    wall of the city, and plundered the temple and palace, he returned with the
                    spoils to Samaria. This misfortune seems to have damped the military ardour of
                    Amaziah; for although he reigned 15 years after his defeat, we are not informed
