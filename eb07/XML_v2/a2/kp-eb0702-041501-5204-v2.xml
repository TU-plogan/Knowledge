                <p part="N"><label type="entry">ALFARABIUS</label>, a celebrated eastern philosopher
                    of the tenth century, was born, in what year is not known, at Farab, a city of
                    Asia Minor, now called Othrar. He studied for some time at Bagdad, then the
                    chief seat of learning; and afterwards travelled, in order to form an
                    acquaintance with the learned of other countries.</p>
                <p part="N">A great revolution of sentiment in regard to letters had taken place, in
                    the preceding century, among the followers of Mahomet. The commanders of the
                    faithful had become the patrons and cultivators, instead of the scourgers and
                    contemners, of science and literature. Knowledge found her only sanctuary under
                    the successors of those rulers who had sought to extinguish every ray of
                    intellectual light by means of the destruction of the libraries of Alexandria.
                    Instead of proscribing every book as useless but the Koran, some of these rulers
                    carried their zeal in the cause of learning so far as to make the acquisition of
                    Greek manuscripts an objector negotiation in their treaties with the emperors of
                    Constantinople. Under the caliphs of the house of Abbas, men of learning were
                    raised to a degree of favour and consequence which has never been enjoyed by
                    that class, under the sovereigns of any other country, in any age of the world.
                    The munificence which shone forth with so much lustre in the supreme
                    depositaries of power was widely emulated among the inferior rulers and
                    governors; and “this emulation,” to use the words of Gibbon, “diffused the taste
                    and the rewards of science,from Samarcand and Bochara,toFez andCordova.” Every
                    little court had its circle of men of letters, who were always admitted to the
                    society of the prince, and for the most part liberally supported by his bounty.
                    Thus, when Alfarabius, after he had finished his travels, came to settle at
                    Damas, he was received with open arms by its sovereign, who bestowed upon him a
                    pension, which he continued to enjoy till his death,, in the year 950.</p>
                <p part="N">But to gain the notice of princes, or to acquire wealth, formed none of
                    the aims of this philosopher. He is said to have led a very retired and ascetic
                    life, rather contemning than seeking after the good things of the world. “He
                    constantly slept, even during winter, upon straw; his countenance was always
                    sorrowful, and he found no consolation in any thing but philosophy.” (Enfield’s
                        <hi rend="italic">History of Philosophy,</hi> b. V. c. 1.) His works were
                    numerous, and very various in their subjects; his speculations seem, indeed,
                    from the list of his writings, to have embraced Łlie whole circle of the
                    sciences. He is particularly deserving of notice, as having been perhaps the
                    first compiler of an <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia.</hi> Such is the title of
                    one of his works, of which there is a copy in manuscript in the library of the
                    Escurial. It contains, according to the brief notice of it given in Casiri’s
                    valuable account of the Arabic manuscripts in that collection, a clear and
                    comprehensive definition and compendium of all the arts and sciences; and it
                    appears to have been regarded in the East as the most valuable of Alfarabius’s
                    compositions, ft would have been agreeable to the lovers of literary history to
                    have possessed some more detailed view of the extent, plan, and contents of an
                    Encyclopaedia written by ≈tn Arabian so many centuries before any work of that
                    description was thought of in Europe.</p>
                <p part="N">^ext to this in estimation appears to have been his treatise on <hi
                        rend="italic">Music,</hi> i∏ which lie is said to have applied the
                    principles of physics to correct the errors of musical theorists, and to
                    regulate the construction of musical instruments. <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Biog.</hi><hi rend="italic">Universelle,</hi> tom. i.) Casiri gives a
                    complete list of his writings, but it is too long to be copied in this place.
                    (See <hi rend="italic">Bibl. Arabico-Hispana Escurialensis,</hi> tom. i.) Some
                    of his pieces were published in the Latin tongue at Paris in 1633, under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">OpusculaVaria</hi> Alfarabii.</p>
