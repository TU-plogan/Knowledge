                    celebrated English actor in the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James, and
                    founder of the college of Dulwich in Surrey, was born at London, in the parish
                    of St Botolph, on the 1st of September 1566, as appears from a memorandum of his
                    own writing. Dr Füller says that he was bred a stage-player, and that his father
                    would have given him a liberal education, but that he was not turned for a
                    serious eourse of life. &gt; He was, however, a youth of an excellent eapacity,
                    a eheerful temper, a tenacious memory, a sweet eloeution, and in his person of a
                    stately port and aspeet; all which advantages might well induce a young man to
                    take to the theatrical profession. By several authorities we find he must have
                    been on the stage some time before 1592; for at that time he was in high favour
                    with the town, and greatly applauded by the best judges, particularly by Ben
                    Jonson.</p>
                <p part="N">Haywood, in his prologue to Marlow’s <hi rend="italic">Jew of
                        Malta,</hi> calls him Proteus for shapes, and Roseius for a tongue. He
                    usually played the capital parts, and was one of the original actors in
                    Shakspeare’s plays; in some of Ben Jonson’s he was also a principal performer:
                    but what characters he personated in any of thqir plays, it is difficult now to
                    determine. This is owing ,to the inaeeu-racy of their editors,, who did not
                    print the names of the players opposite to, the characters they performed, as
                    the modern custom is; but gave one general list of actors to the whole set of
                    plays, as in the old folio edition of Shak-speare; or divided one from the
                    other, setting the dramatis personae before the plays, and the catalogue of
                    performers after them, as in Jonson’s.</p>
                <p part="N">It may appear surprising how one of Mr Alleyn’s profession should be
                    enabled to ereet sueh an edifiee as Dulwich College, and liberally endow it for
                    the maintenance θf so many persons. But it must be observed that he had some
                    paternal fortune, whieh, though small, might lay a foundation for his future
                    affluenee; and it is to be presumed, that the profits he received from aeting,
                    to one of his provident and managing disposition, and one who by his excellence
                    in playing drew after him sueh erowds of spectators, must have considerably
                    improved his fortune: besides, he was not only aetor, but master of a playhouse
                    built at his own expense, by whieh he is said to have amassed considerable
                    wealth. He was also keeper of the king’s wild beasts, or master of the. royal
                    bear-garden, which was frequented by vast erowds of spectators; and the profits
                    arising from these sports are said to have amounted to L.500 per annum. He was
                    thriee married; and the portions of his first two wives, they leaving him uo
                    issue to inherit, might probably contribute to this benefaction. Such donations
                    have been frequently thought to proeeed more from vanity and ostentation than
                    real piety; but this of Mr Alleyn has been aseribed to a very singular cause,
                    for the devil has been said to be the first promoter of it. Mr Aubrey mentions a
                    tradition, that Mr Alleyn playing a demon, with six others, in one of
                    Shakspeare’s plays, was in the midst of the play surprised by an apparition of
                    the devil; whieh so worked on his fancy, that he made a vow, whieh he performed
                    by building Dulwich College. He began the foundation of this eollege, un der,
                    the direction of Inigo Jones, in 1614; and the buildings, gardens, &amp;c. were
                    finished in 1617, in which he is said to have expended about L.10,000. After the
                    eollege was built, he met with some difficulty in obtaining a eharter for
                    settling his lands in mortmain; for he proposed to endow it with L.800 per
                    annum, for the maintenance of one master, one warden, and four fellows, three
                    whereof were to be clergymen, and the fourth a skilful organist; also six poor
                    men and as many women, besides twelve poor boys to bę educated till the age of
                    fourteen or sixteen, and then put out to some trade or ealling. The obstruction
                    he met with arose from the lord ehancellor Baeon, who wished King James to
                    settle part of those lands for support of two academical lectures; and he wrote
                    a letter to the marquis of Buckingham, dated August 18, 1618, entreating him to
                    use his interest with his majesty for that purpose. Mr Alleyn’s solicitation
                    was, however, at last complied with, and he obtained the royal licence, giving
                    him full power.to lay his foundation, by his majesty’s letters patent, bearing
                    date the 21st of June 1619; by virtue whereof lie did, in the ehapel at the said
                    new hospital at Dulwich, called <hi rend="italic">The College oj God's
                        Gift,</hi> on the 13th of September following, publiely read and publish a
                    quadripartite writing in parchment, whereby he created and established the said
                    college; he then subscribed it with his name, and fixed his seal to several
                    parts thereof, in presenee of several honourable persons, and ordered eopies of
                    the writings to four different parishes· He was himself the first master of his
                    eollege; so that, to make use of the words of Mr Haywood, one of his
                    contemporaries, ‘ He was <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> so mingled with humility
                    and eharity, that he became his own pensioner, humbly submitting himself to that
                    proportion of diet and elothes whieh he had bestowed on others.’ We have no
                    reason to think he ever repented of this distribution of his substanee; but, on
                    the contrary, that he was entirely satisfied, as appears from the following
                    memorial in his own writing, found amongst his papers.—‘ May 26, 1620. My wife
                    and I acknowledged the fine at the eommon pleas bar, of all our lands to the
                    college: blessed be God that he hath given us life to do it.’” His wife died in
                    the year 1623; and about two years afterwards he married Constance Kinehtoe, who
                    survived him, and received remarkable proofs of his affeetion, if at least we
                    may judge of it by his will, in whieh he left her considerable property. He died
                    on the 25th of November 1626, in the 61st year of his age, and was buried in the
                    ehapel.of his new college, where there is a tomb-stone over his grave, with an
                    inscription. His original diary is also there preserved.</p>
                <p part="N">The subjoining aneedote is entertaining in itself, and shows the high
                    esteem in which Mr Alleyn was held as an aetor :—“Edward Alleyn, the Garriek of
                    Shakspeare’s time, had been on the most friendly footing with our poet, as well
                    as Ben Jonson. They used frequently to spend their evenings together at the sign
                    of the Globe, somewhere near Blaekfriars, where the playhouse then was. The
                    world need not be told, that the eonvivial hours of such a triumvirate must be
                    pleasing aş well as.profitable, and may be said to be .sueh pleasures as might
                    bear the refleetions of the morning. In eonsequenee of one of these meetings,
                    the following letter was written by G. Peele, a student of Christ Church
                    College, Oxford, and a dramatie poet, who belonged to the Club, to one Marle, an
                    intimate of his <pb break="no" facs="nls:193036647?mode=fullsize"

                    last night: we were all very merrye at the Globe, when Ned Alleyn did not
                    scruple to affyrme pleasauntly to thy Friende Will, that he had stolen his
