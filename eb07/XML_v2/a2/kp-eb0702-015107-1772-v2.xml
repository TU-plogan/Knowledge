                <p part="N"><label type="entry">ADHESION</label>, a term chiefly used to denote the
                    force with which the surface of a solid remains attached to the surface of a
                    liquid, after they have been brought into contact. Suppose a polished glass
                    plate to be suspended horizontally from one extremity of a balance, and to be
                    exactly counterpoised by weights put into the opposite scale; if we bring this
                    plate in contact with the surface of a quantity of mereury, we shall find that a
                    certain additional weight must be placed in the opposite scale in order to
                    separate the glass from the mercury. The force which kept the two bodies in
                    contact is called <hi rend="italic">adhesion.</hi> Three sets of experiments on
                    this subject have been published by different philosophers. <hi
                        rend="superscript"> x</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Dr Brook Taylor, in a paper on <hi rend="italic">Magnetism,</hi>
                    inserted in die Philosophical Transactions for 1721, describes the result of his
                    trials to determine the weight necessary to separate fir-boards of different
                    sizes from the surface of water. The result of his experiments was, that the
                    weight necessary is proportional to the surface of the fir-board to be
                    raised.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1773, Guyton-Morveau ascertained experimentally the force of
                    adhesion of eleven different metals of mercury. The metals whieh he employed
                    were pure. The surface of eaeh was an inch (French) in diameter, and polished.
                    The following table exhibits the weight in French grains necessary to separate
                    each metal from the mercury.</p>

                <p part="N">Μ. Morveau ascertained hkewιse that the adhesive force is not diminished
                    by removing the pressure of the air.</p>
                <p part="N">A great number of experiments on the same subject were made at a still
                    later period by Mr Achard of Berlin. He measured the force of adhesion between
                    various substances and water. He found that when the temperature was increased,
                    the adhesion proportionally diminished. He even attempted to determine the
                    diminution occasioned by the elevation of temperature, amounting to a single
                    degree of the thermometer; and gives us a formula denoting that diminution. But
                    it is not necessary to enter into any details respecting his experiments here,
                    for a reason that will appear immediately.</p>
                <p part="N">Besides these three philosophers, many others have examined the rise of
                    liquids in capillary tubes, a phenomenon whieh is nothing else than a peculiar
                    ease of adhesion, though we cannot with propriety treat of it here. Laplaee
                    published a dissertation on the subject in the year 1805, in whieh he has given
                    us an historical detail, whieh, however, is far from accurate. His reasoning
                    appears to us in general correct; though several very plain propositions are
                    rather obscured than elucidated by his mathematical demonstrations.</p>
                <p part="N">When we make experiments on the adhesion of solids to liquids, and
                    endeavour to ascertain the force requisite to separate them from eaeh other, two
                    eases may oceur: the solid body may separate from the liquid <hi rend="italic"
                        >dry,</hi> or its surface may be covered with a thin coating of the liquid,
                    which it retains. If a surface of tallow be placed in contact with water, and
                    separated from it by weights sucees-sively introduced into the opposite scale,
                    we shall find, after the separation has taken place, that the surface of the
                    tallow is <hi rend="italic">dry,</hi> or that it has not carried along with it a
                    thin coating of the water. But when we employ a firboard, as Dr Brook Taylor did
                    in his experiments, and as Mr Achard did in many of his, the ease is very
                    different: we shall find the whole surface of the board thoroughly <hi
                        rend="italic">wetted</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that is to say, a thin
                    film of the liquid remains adhering to the wood. Now, it is only the first of
                    these two cases that can be considered as exhibiting the true foree of adhesion.
                    In the second case, it is not the solid whieh separates from the liquid, but one
                    portion of the liquid which separates from the other. Sueh experiments,
                    therefore, really show the foree of cohesion between the particles of the
                    liquid, not the force of adhesion between the solid and the liquid. Now, as the
                    experiments of Brook Taylor and Achard belong all to this last case, it is
                    obvious that they cannot be considered as experiments on adhesion. We must
                    therefore leave them out of our consideration at present. The cohesion of the
                    particles of liquids is well known to diminish as the temperature increases,
                    till at a certain temperature this cohesion disappears altogether, and the
                    liquids assume the state of elastic fluids, the particles of whieh repel eaeh
                    other. Hence the reason why, in Achard’s experiments, the adhesive force
                    diminished as the temperature increased.</p>
                <p part="N">i <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031785?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0702-1785-0152"/>Adhesion is obviously an attractive force, by
                    which the two surfaces are kept in contact. It must evidently increase as the
                    surfaces adhere, because the number of adhering particles increase in the same
                    ratio. This force is insensible when the two surfaces are at any perceptible
                    distance from one another; so that it acts only at insensible distances. From
                    Morveau <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s experiments it appears, that it differs
                    very much in intensity when different solids are made to adhere to the same
                    liquid. Tlιus, gold adheres to mercury with a force more than twice as great as
                    zinc does, and almost fifty-six times as great as cobalt does. Now these two
                    properties, namely, acting only at insensible distances, and varying in
                    intensity in different bodies, characterize that peculiar force known by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">chemical affinity.</hi> But there is one particular in
                    which chemical affinity appears at first sight to differ from adhesion. Chemical
                    affinity is confined to the ultimate particles or atoms of bodies; whereas
                    adhesion takes place between surfaces of any size whatever.</p>
                <p part="N">But if we consider that these surfaces consist each of a congeries of
                    atoms united into a large mass by the force of cohesion; that adhesion is not
                    sensible at any perceptible distance, however great the extent of surfaces may
                    be; and that its strength increases in proportion to the surfaces ;—if we
                    consider these phenomena, we shall find reason to conclude that adhesion is a
                    force which acts only between the atoms or integrant particles of bodies. It is
                    therefore merely a case of <hi rend="italic">chemical affinity.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The phenomena of adhesion depend upon the strength of affinity between
                    the adhering bodies. If the affinity be weak, the two surfaces will separate by
                    a small force applied, and the solid will retain no impression of the liquid
                    whatever. This happens when cobalt is brought in contact with mercury, or tallow
                    with water. If the affinity be strong, a considerable force will be requisite to
                    separate the two surfaces. This is the case when gold or silver is brought in
                    contact with mercury. So great is the affinity indeed in these cases, that if
                    the adhesion continue for a short time, a combination actually takes place
                    between the two metals. In that case the gold comes away white, or coated over
                    with a film of mercury; the experiment is no longer an example of the force of
                    adhesion between mercury and gold, but exhibits the cohesive force of the
                    particles of mercury to each other. We have even found that this holds with
                    platinum, though it be a metal which has a much weaker affinity for mercury than
                    gold has. If a clean surface of platinum be kept for some time in contact with
                    that of mercury, a very evident amalgamation takes place.</p>
                <p part="N">When a surface of wood, marble, or metal, comes in contact with water,
                    on removing it we find that surface moist; that is to say, it has carried with
                    it a thin film of water. This shows us that the adhesive force of water, or the
                    affinity of water to these different bodies, is greater than the cohesive force
                    of the particles of water to each other. Yet this force is not sufficiently
                    strong to produce a chemical combination between the respective bodies. When a
                    surface of sugar or common salt comes in contact with water, this surface is not
                    merely wetted. If the contact be continued for a sufficient time, the solid
                    loses its cohesion, and is dissolved by the liquid. This is a complicated case.
                    The water by capillary attraction insinuates itself through the pores of the
                    sugar. The minute crystals of sugar are deprived of their cohesion to each other
                    by this intervening liquid. Being separated from each other, they gradually
                    dissolve or enter into a chemical combination with the water. (<hi
