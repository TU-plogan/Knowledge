                    It is a flourishing place, well built, and still increasing. Having been in an
                    improving state for the last forty years, it has now a considerable trade, and
                    employs about 6000 tons of shipping, chiefly in the importation of flax, the raw
                    material of its manufactures; of flax-seed, timber, iron, &amp;c. from the
                    Baltic. The chief employment of the inhabitants is the spinning of flax by
                    machinery, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030147?mode=fullsize"

                    sheetings. A considerable coasting trade is carried on to London and to the
                    ports on the east coast of England, as well as to Leith and the other ports in
                    the frith of Forth. At this place, in default of a natural harbour, an
                    artificial one of piers has been formed, where, at spring tides, which rise here
                    fifteen feet, ships of two hundred tons can come, and of eighty at neap tides;
                    but they must lie dry at low water. Its chief fault is that it is small, and
                    offers no refuge from the German Ocean in easterly storms, though it is cápable
                    of improvement, and, with some expense, might be rendered secure. A battery,
                    which was erected for its defence in 1781, in consequence of an attack from a
                    French privateer, has since been dismantled. This port is of great antiquity:
                    there is an agreement yet extant between the abbot and the burghers of
                    Aberbrothick, in 1194, concerning the making of the harbour. Both parties were
                    bound to contribute their proportions; but the largest fell to the share of the
                    former, for which he was to receive an annual tax payable out of every rood of
                    land lying within the borough. The glory of this place was the abbey, whose very
                    ruins give some idea of its former magnificence. It was founded by William the
                    Lion in 1178, and dedicated to our celebrated primate Thomas a Becket. The
                    founder was buried there; but there are no remains of his tomb, or any other,
                    excepting that of a monk of the name of Alexander Nicol. The monks were of the
                    Tyronensian order; and were first brought from Kelso, whose abbot declared those
                    of this place, on the first institution, to be free from his jurisdiction. The
                    last abbot was the famous Cardinal Beaton, at the same time archbishop of St
                    Andrews, and, before his death, as great and absolute here as Wolsey was in
                    England. King John, the English monarch, granted this monastery most uncommon
                    privileges; for, by charter under the great seal, he exempted it <hi

                    part of England, except London. At Aberbrothick is a chalybeate water, similar
                    to those of Peterhead and Glendye. The only public buildings worthy of notice,
                    besides the ruins of the abbey, are the parish church and chapels of ease, the
                    town-house, the public schools, and the signal tower which communicates with the
                    Bell Rock light-house at 12 miles distance in the German Ocean. Arbroath is a
                    royal burgh, and unites with Aberdeen, Bervie, Montrose, and Brechin, in sending
                    a member to the British parliament. 58 miles N.N.E. of Edinburgh. Population in
