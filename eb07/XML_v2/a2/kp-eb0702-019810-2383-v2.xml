                type="entry">
                <p part="N"><label type="entry">AETHER</label> is usually understood of a thin,
                    subtile matter or medium, much finer and rarer than air, which, commencing from
                    the limits of our atmosphere, possesses the whole heavenly space. The word is
                    Greek, <hi rend="italic">αι6ηξ,</hi> supposed to be formed from the verb <hi
                        rend="italic">αι6ειv, to burn, to flame;</hi> some of the ancients,
                    particularly Anaxagoras, supposing it to be of the nature of fire.</p>
                <p part="N">The philosophers cannot conceive that the largest part of the creation
                    should be perfectly void; and therefore they fill it with a species of matter
                    under the denomination of <hi rend="italic">aether.</hi> But they vary extremely
                    as to the nature and character of this aether. Some conceive it as a body <hi
                        rend="italic">sui generis,</hi> appointed only to fill up the vacuities
                    between the heavenly bodies, and therefore confined to the regions above our
                    atmosphere. Others suppose it of so subtile and penetrating a nature as to
                    pervade the air and other bodies, and to possess the pores and intervals
                    thereof. Others deny the existence of any such specific matter, and think tne
                    air itself, by that immense tenuity and expansion it is found capable of, may
                    diffuse itself through the interstellar spaces, and be the only matter found
                    therein.</p>
                <p part="N">In effect, aether being no object of our sense, but the mere work of
                    imagination, brought only upon the stage for the sake of hypothesis, or to solve
                    söme phenomenon real or imaginary, authors take the liberty of modifying it as
                    they please. Some suppose it of an elementary nature, like other bodies, and
                    only distinguished by its tenuity, and the other affections consequent thereon;
                    which is the philosophical aether. Others will have it of another species, and
                    not elementary, but rather a sort of fifth element, of a purer, more refined,
                    and spiritous nature, than the substances about our earth, and void of the
                    common affections thereof, as gravity, &amp;c. The heavenly spaces being the
                    supposed region or residence of a more exalted class of beings, the medium must
                    be more exalted in proportion. Such is the ancient and popular idea of aether,
                    or aethereal· matter.</p>
                <p part="N">The term <hi rend="italic">aether</hi> being thus embarrassed with a
                    variety of ideas, and arbitrarily applied to so many different things, the later
                    and severer philosophers choose to set it aside, and in lieu thereof substitute
                    other more determinate ones. Thus, the Cartesians use the term <hi rend="italic"
                        >materia</hi><hi rend="italic">subtilis,</hi> which is their aether: and Sir
                    Isaac Newton, sometimes a <hi rend="italic">subtile spirit,</hi> as in the close
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Principia;</hi> and sometimes a <hi rend="italic"
                        >subtile</hi> or <hi rend="italic">aethereal medium,</hi> as in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Optics.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Heat, Sir Isaac Newton observes, is communicated through a vacuum almost
                    as readily as through air; but such communication cannot be without some
                    interjacent body, to act as a medium. And such body maybe subtile enough to
                    penetrate the pores of glass, and may permeate those of all other bodies, and
                    consequently be diffused through all the parts of space.</p>
                <p part="N">The existence of such an aethereal medium being settled, that author
                    proceeds to its properties; inferring it to be not only rarer and more fluid
                    than air, but exceedingly more elastic and active; in virtue of which properties
                    he shows, that a great part of the phenomena of nature may be produced by it. To
                    the weight, <hi rend="italic">e. g.</hi> of this medium, he attributes
                    gravitation, or the weight of all other bodies; and to its elasticity, the
                    elastic force of the air and of nervous fibres, and the emission, refraction,
                    reflection, and other phenomena of light; as also sensation, muscular <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193032396?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-2396-0199"
                    />motion, &amp;c. In fine, this same matter seems the <hi rend="italic"
                        >primum</hi><hi rend="italic">mobile,</hi> the first source or spring of
                    physical action in the modem system.</p>
                <p part="N">The Cartesian aether is supposed not only to pervade, but adequately to
                    fill, all the vacuities of bodies; and thus to make an absolute plenum in the
                    universe.</p>
                <p part="N">But Sir Isaac Newton shows that the celestial spaces are void of all
                    sensible resistance; and hence it follows, that the matter contained therein
                    must be immensely rare, in regard the resistance of bodies is chiefly as their
                    density: so that if the heavens were thus adequately filled with a medium or
                    matter, how subtile soever, they would resist the motion of the planets and
                    comets much more than quicksilver or gold. But it has been supposed that what
                    Newton has said of aether is to be considered only as a conjecture, and
                    especially as no new proofs of its existence have been adduced since his
                    time.</p>
                <p part="N">The late discoveries in electricity have thrown great light upon this
                    subject, and rendered it extremely probable that the aether so often talked of
                    is no other than the electric fluid, or solar light, which diffuses itself
                    throughout the whole system of nature.</p>
