                    anciently offered to some deity. The heathens at first made their altars only of
                    turf; afterwards they were made of stone, of marble, of wood, and even of horn,
                    as that of Apollo in Delos. Altars differed in figure as well as in materials:
                    some were round, others square, and others triangular. All of them were turned
                    towards the east, and stood lower than the statues of the gods; and they were
                    generally adorned with sculpture, representing either the gods to whom they were
                    erected, or their symbols. The height of altars also differed according to the
                    different gods to whom they sacrificed. According to Servius, those altars set
                    apart for the honour of the celestial gods, and gods of the higher class, were
                    placed on some pretty tall pile of building, and for that reason were called <hi
                        rend="italic">altaria,</hi> from the words <hi rend="italic">alta</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">ara,</hi> a high elevated altar. Those appointed for the
                    terrestrial gods were laid on the surface of the earth, and called <hi

                    opened a pit for those of the infernal gods, which they called <hi rend="italic"
                        >ßoôgo/, λα×xοι,</hi><hi rend="italic">scrobiculi.</hi> But this distinction
                    is not everywhere observed: the best authors frequently use <hi rend="italic"
                        >ara</hi> as a general word, under which are included the altars of the
                    celestial and infernal, as well as those of the terrestrial gods. The Greeks
                    also distinguished two sorts of altars: that whereon they sacrificed to the gods
                    was called <hi rend="italic">βωμος,</hi> and was a real altar, different from
                    the other whereon they sacrificed to the heroes, which was smaller, and called
                        <hi rend="italic">ιdχ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> ι</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">αξα,</hi> Pollux makes this distinction of altars in his
                    Onomasticon: he adds, however, that some poets used the word <hi rend="italic"
                        >ε&lt;%οοξa</hi> for the altar whereon sacrifice was offered to the gods.
                    The Septuagint version does sometimes also use the word i&lt;j ’ χαgα for a sort
                    of little low altar, which may be expressed in Latin by <hi rend="italic"
                        >craticula,</hi> being a hearth rather than an altar.</p>
                <p part="N">Before temples were in use, altars were erected sometimes in groves,
                    sometimes in the highways, and sometimes on the tops of mountains; and it was a
                    custom to engrave upon them the name, ensign, or character of the deity to whom
                    they were consecrated.</p>
                <p part="N">In the great temples of ancient Rome there were generally three altars:
                    the first was placed in the sanctuary, at the foot of the statue of the
                    divinity, upon which incense was burnt and libations offered; the second was
                    before the gate of the temple, and upon it they sacrificed the victims; and the
                    third was a portable altar, upon which were placed the offering and the sacred
                    vessels. Besides these uses of altars, the ancients swore upon them and swore by
                    them, in making alliances, confirming treaties of peace, and on other solemn
                    occasions. Altars also served as places of refuge for all those who fled to
                    them.</p>
                <p part="N">Altars are doubtless as ancient as sacrifices themselves; consequently
                    their origin is not much later than that of the world. (Gen. chap, iv.) Some
                    attribute their origin to the Egyptians, others to the Jews, others to the
                    patriarchs before the flood. Some carry them as far back as Adam, whose altar is
                    much spoken of by Jewish, and even Christian writers; others are contented to
                    make the patriarch Enoch the first who consecrated a public altar. Be this as it
                    may, the earliest altars of which we find any express testimony are those
                    erected by Abraham.</p>
                <p part="N">Altars, in the patriarchal times, were very rude. The altar which Jacob
                    set up at Bethel was nothing but a stone, which served him instead of a bolster;
                    that of Gideon, a stone before his house: and the first which God commanded
                    Moses to erect was probably of earth or unpolished stones, without any iron; for
                    if any use was made of that metal, the altar was declared impure.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal altars of the Jews were, the altar of <hi rend="italic"
                        >incense,</hi> that of <hi rend="italic">burnt-offering,</hi> and the <hi
                        rend="italic">altar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">table for the
                        slιoιv-bread.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">altar of incense</hi> was a small table of shittim
                    wood, covered with plates of gold, of one cubit in length, another in width, and
                    two in height. At the four comers were four kinds of horns, and all round a
                    little border or crown over it. This was the altar hidden by Jeremiah before the
                    captivity; and upon it the officiating priest every morning and evening offered
                    incense of a particular composition.</p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">altar of burnt-offerings</hi> was made of shittim
                    wood, and carried upon the shoulders of the priests by means of staves of the
                    same wood overlaid with brass. In the time of Moses this altar was five cubits
                    square and three high; but in Solomon’s temple it was much larger, being twenty
                    cubits square and ten in height. It was covered with brass; and at each corner
                    was a horn or spire, wrought out of the same wood with the altar, to which the
                    sacrifices were tied. W’ithin the hollow was a grate of brass, in which the fire
                    was placed; through it fell the ashes, which were received in a pan below. At
                    the four comers of the grate were four rings and four chains, which kept it up
                    at the horns. This altar was placed in the open air, that the smoke of the
                    burnt-offerings might not sully the inside of the tabernacle.</p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">altar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">table</hi> for the
                        <hi rend="italic">show-bread</hi> was likewise of shittim wood, covered with
                    plates of gold, having a little border round it adorned with sculpture. It was
                    two cubits long, one wide, and one and a half in height. Upon this table, which
                    stood in the holy of holies, were put, every Sabbath day, twelve loaves, with
                    salt and incense.</p>
                <p part="N">After the return of the Jews from the captivity, and the building of the
                    second temple, their altars were in some respects different from those described
                    above. That of burnt-offerings was a large pile, built of unhewn stone, 32
                    cubits square at the bottom, and 24 square at the top. The ascent was by a
                    gentle rising, 32 cubits in length and 16 in breadth.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Altar</hi> is also used among Christians for the
                    communion-table. In the primitive church the altars were only of wood, it being
                    frequently necessary to remove them from place to place; but the council of
                    Paris in 509 decreed that no altar should be built but of stone. At <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193037180?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7180-0567"/>
                    first there was but one altar in each church, but the number soon increased; and
                    from the writings of Gregory the ,Great, who lived in the sixth century, we
                    learn that there were sometimes in the same church twelve or thirteen. In the
                    cathedral of Magdeburg there are no less than 49 altars.</p>
                <p part="N">The altar is sometimes sustained on a single column, as in the
                    subterraneous chapels of St Cecilia at Rome, &amp;c.; and sometimes on four
                    columns, as the altar of St Sebastian of Crypta Arenaria; but the customary form
                    is, a massive frame of stone-work sustaining the altar table. These altars bear
                    a resemblance to tombs: consequently we read in ecclesiastical history that the
                    primitive Christians chiefly held their meetings at the tombs of the martyrs,
                    and celebrated the mysteries of religion upon them; for which reason it is a
                    standing rule to this day in the church of Rome, never to build an altar without
                    inclosing the relics of some saint in it.</p>
