                <p part="N">Monasteries were at first established as religious houses, to which
                    persons retired from the bustle of the world to spend their time in solitude and
                    devotion. But they soon degenerated from their original institution, and
                    obtained large privileges, exemptions, and riches. They prevailed greatly in
                    Britain before the Reformation, particularly in England; and as they increased
                    in riches, so the state became poor: for the lands which these regulars
                    possessed were <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">mortua manu,</hi> i.
                    e. could never revert to the lords who gave them. This inconvenience gave rise
                    to the statutes against gifts in <hi rend="italic">mortmain</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> and Lord Coke tells us, that several lords, at their
                    creation, had a clause in their grant, that the donor might give or sell his
                    land to whom he would <hi rend="italic">(exceptis viris religiosis</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Judaeis)</hi> excepting monks and
                    Jews.</p>
                <p part="N">These places were wholly abolished in England at the time of the
                    Reformation; Henry VIII. having first appointed visitors to inquire into the
                    lives of the monks and nuns, which were found in some places to be extremely
                    irregular. The abbots, perceiving their dissolution unavoidable, were induced to
                    resign their houses to the king, who by that means became invested with the
                    abbey lands: these were afterwards granted to different persons, whose
                    descendants enjoy them at this day.</p>
                <p part="N">Though the suppression of religious houses, even considered in a
                    political light only, was a national benefit, it must be owned, that at the time
                    they flourished, they were far from useless. Abbeys or monasteries were then the
                    repositories, as well as the seminaries, of learning; many valuable books and
                    national records, as well as private history, having been preserved in their
                    libraries, the only places in which they could have been safely lodged in those
                    turbulent times. Many of those which had escaped the ravages of the Danes, were
                    destroyed with more than Gothic barbarity at the dissolution of the abbeys.
                    These ravages are pathetically lamented by John Bale: “A number of those,” says
                    he, “who purchased these superstitious mansions, reserved of the library books,
                    some to serve their jakes, some to scour the candlesticks, and some to rub their
                    boots; some they sold to the grocer and soapseller; and some they sent over sea
                    to the bookbinders, not in small numbers, but in whole ships full; yea, the
                    universities of this realm are not clear of so detestable a fact. I know a
                    merchant that bought the contents of two noble libraries for 40s. price; a shame
                    it is to be spoken! This stuff hath he occupied instead of gray paper, by the
                    space of more than these ten years, and yet he hath store enough for as many
                    years to come. I shall judge this to be true, and utter it with heaviness, that
                    neither the Britons under the Romans and Saxons, nor yet the English people
                    under the Danes and Normans, had ever such damage of their learned monuments as
                    we have seen in our time.”</p>
                <p part="N">Every abbey had at least one person whose office it was to instruct
                    youth; and the historians of this country are chiefly beholden to the monks for
                    the knowledge they have of former national events. In these houses also the arts
                    of painting, architecture, and printing, were cultivated. They were hospitals
                    for the sick and poor, and afforded entertainment to travellers at a time when
                    there were no inns. They were likewise an asylum for aged and indigent persons
                    of good family.</p>
