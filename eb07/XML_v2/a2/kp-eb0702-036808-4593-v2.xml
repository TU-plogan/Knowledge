                    eminent botanist and gardener, was born at a village near Hamilton in Scotland
                    in 1731. Having been regularly trained to the profession of a gardener, he came
                    into England in the year 1754, and soon obtained the notice of the celebrated
                    Philip Miller, then superintendent of the physic garden at Chelsea, who engaged
                    him as an assistant. His industry and abilities recommended him to the
                    princess-dowager of Walesas a fit person to manage the botanical garden at Kew.
                    In 1759 he was appointed to this office, in which he continued during life, and
                    which was the source of his fame and fortune. The garden at Kew, under the
                    auspices of his present Majesty, was destined to be the grand repository of all
                    the vegetable riches which could be accumulated by regal munificence, from
                    researches through every quarter of the globe. These treasures were fortunately
                    committed to the hands of Mr Aiton, whose care and skill in their cultivation,
                    and intelligence in their arrangement, acquired him high reputation among the
                    lovers of the science, and the particular esteem of his royal patrons. Under his
                    superintendence many improvements took place in the plan and edifices of Kew
                    gardens, which rendered them the principal scene of botanical culture in the
                    kingdom. In 1783 his merit was properly rewarded with the lucrative office of
                    managing the pleasure and kitchen gardens of Kew, which he was allowed to retain

                        <hi rend="italic">Hortus</hi><hi rend="italic">Kewensis,</hi> or a Catalogue
                    of the Plants cultivated in the Royal Botanical Garden at Kcw, in 3 vols. 8vo,
                    with 13 plates; a work which had been the labour of many years. The number of
                    species contained in this work amounted to between five and six thousand, many
                    of which had not before been described. A new and curious article in it relates
                    to the first introduction of particular exotics into the English gardens. The
                    system of arrangement adopted is the Linnaean, with improvements, which the
                    advanced state of botanical science required. Mr Aiton, with candour and
                    modesty, acknowledges the assistance he received in this work from the two
                    eminent Swedish naturalists, Dr Solander and Mr Jonas Dryander. Indeed, his
                    character was such as secured him the friendship and good offices of the most
                    distinguished names in science of his time. He was for many years peculiarly
                    honoured by the notice of Sir Joseph Banks, the president of the Royal Society.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Hortus</hi><hi rend="italic">Kewensis</hi> was received
                    with avidity by the botanic world, and a large impression was soon disposed

                <p part="N">Notwithstanding the singular activity and temperance of Mr Aiton, he
                    fell into that incurable malady, a schirrous liver, of which he died in 1793, in
                    his 62d year. His eldest son, devoted to the same pursuits, was, by the king’s
                    own nomination, appointed to all his father’s employments. Mr Alton’s private
                    character was highly estimable for mildness, benevolence, piety, and every
                    domestic and social virtue. He was interred in the church-yard of Kew, amidst a
                    most respectable concourse of friends.</p>
