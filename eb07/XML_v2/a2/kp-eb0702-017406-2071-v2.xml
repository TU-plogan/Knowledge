                    this distinction, as being the first systematic and successful attempt to apply
                    mathematical reasoning to the subjects of electricity and magnetism. Already the
                    theory of Franklin with regard to the former was very generally received, and
                    was supposed to afford a satisfactory explanation of the phenomena. But though
                    it seemed sufficient for this purpose in the common and somewhat loose manner in
                    which the matter had hitherto been treated, it was not certain that the same
                    would hold when the conclusions were accurately and mathematically deduced. To
                    apply this test was what AEpinus undertook, and what he has executed in a manner
                    very satisfactory and complete. He has treated very fully, and perhaps has
                    nearly exhausted, what may be called the <hi rend="italic">statics</hi> of
                    electricity and magnetism, or the equilibrium of their forces. A great field yet
                    remains, where the motion of the electric fluid is to be considered, and its
                    distribution over the surfaces of bodies of a given figure; where greater
                    difficulties are to be encountered, and where the latest improvements of the
                    integral calculus in the hands of Laplace and Poisson have begun to be applied.
                    The investigations of AEpinus in their own department led to very satisfactory
                    results, and the exact agreement between them and the phenomena actually
                    exhibited was extensively observed. Notwithstanding this agreement, we cannot
                    consider the theory of positive and negative electricity as being yet
                    sufficiently established. Though the assumption on which it is founded appear
                    very simple at first, it is found more complex on a nearer inspection. The
                    assumption is, that a fluid resides in the surfaces of all the bodies termed
                    electrics, which is highly elastic, and strongly attracted, at the same time, by
                    the particles of the body; and that while this fluid remains equally diffused
                    over the surface of the body, no phenomenon whatever gives any information of
                    its existence. By certain mechanical operations, <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193032084?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-2084-0175"/>however,
                    the equilibrium of this fluid maybe destroyed; the fluid may be accumulated at
                    one end, or on one side of a body, and entirely withdrawn from the opposite. It
                    is when an electric is brought into this state that it exhibits the phenomena of
                    electricity, between which and the calculus instituted on the suppositions just
                    laid down, AEpinus has everywhere remarked the most exact agreement. One great
                    difficulty, however, still remains: the negative ends of two electrified bodies
                    repel one another justas much as the ends which are reckoned positive. But such
                    an effect cannot result from the mere absence of a substance: when the electric
                    fluid is withdrawn, if repulsion still continue, it must arise from the mutual
                    action of the particles of the body itself. Thus it would appear, that, in the
                    absence of the electric fluid, the tendency of the particles of matter is to
                    repel one another. This is an essential part of the theory; and it is not
                    accurate to say, that the doctrine of Franklin or AEpinus supposes no more than
                    the existence of an clastic fluid diffused over the surfaces, and strongly
                    attracted by the particles, of bodies. It supposes, besides, that those
                    particles, in the absence of this fluid, mutually repel one another. This not
                    only takes away from the simplicity of the hypothesis, but it is obviously a
                    very unnatural, not to say a contradictory supposition; because, when the
                    electric matter is removed, how comes it to pass that the particles of the body,
                    notwithstanding their mutual repulsion, still cohere together as firmly as
                    before? This difficulty is acknowledged by AEpinus himself; but it would seem
                    that the theory had taken a strong hold of his mind before he was aware of this
                    consequence from it, so that he became by degrees reconciled to a supposition
                    which appeared to him at first not a little incongruous. This must not surprise
                    us: it is not always that, even among philosophers, we meet with the candour, or
                    perhaps we should say the courage, with which Newton suspended his belief in his
                    own great discovery, the principle of universal gravity, as long as the
                    erroneous opinion then existing about the magnitude of the earth made the moon’s
                    motion in her orbit appear inconsistent with the descent of falling bodies.</p>
                <p part="N">Another remark, made by AEpinus himself, involves in it a difficulty
                    which should have induced him to view his theory with considerable diffidence.
                    Though he considers the difference of the two electricities to be the same as
                    between excess and defect, or to consist in this, that the fluid which is
                    deficient in the one part is in excess in the other, he admits that no
                    phenomenon points out on which side the excess, or on which the defect lies.
                    This is a strong indication that the difference is not of the kind supposed. We
                    are not left at a loss to tell whether cold is the absence of a substance which
                    we call heat, or heat the absence of a substance whieh we call cold. If there
                    were just as much reason for asserting the one of these propositions as the
                    other, one would certainly be inclined to reject both. The same should be done
                    with respect to electricity and magnetism.</p>
                <p part="N">The investigations of AEpinus, however, are by no means rendered
                    useless, even if the <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> theory of positive and
                    negative electricity, or of positive and negative magnetism, be exchanged for
                    that of two elastic fluids, each attracting the other, and both attracted by the
                    particles of bodies. Most of his investigations may be easily accommodated to
                    tlιis supposition, and, therefore, they are, fortunately for themselves and for
                    their author, of a more permanent nature than the principles from which they
                    were deduced.</p>
                <p part="N">It is to be added to this, that AEpinus was the first who saw the
                    affinity between electricity and magnetism in its full extent, and perceived the
                    light that these two mutually cast on one another. He instituted a regular
                    series of experiments on the nature of the tourmaline, on which he wrote a small
                    treatise, published in 1762. He is to be regarded also as the inventor of the
                    condenser of electricity, and of the electrophorus, of which he gave the
                    complete theory.</p>
                <p part="N">A very excellent view of the theory of AEpinus was published at Parts by
                    Μ. Haiiy in 1787, in 8vo. The same author has, however, adopted the theory of
                    the two fluids in his own treatise, <hi rend="italic">Leçons</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">de Physique.</hi> There is a remarkable coincidence between
                    AEpinus’s work on electricity and magnetism, and that of Mr Cavendish, given in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1771, p. 584. The
                    principles from which they set out, and the conclusions at which they arrive,
                    are in a great measure the same. It appears, however, quite certain, that Mr
                    Cavendish knew nothing of the work ofthe Russian philosopher till his own was
                    completed. His mode of proceeding is more geometrical, and in some parts he has
                    gone farther.</p>
                <p part="N">The researches of AEpinus were not confined to the subjects now
                    mentioned, but extended to most of the branches of natural philosophy. Beside
                    the treatise on the tourmaline, he published, in 1762, a work, in 4to, <hi
                        rend="italic">On the distribution of heat at the surface of the
                        earth</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript">;</hi> a work
                    which, though translated into French, has hardly, we believe, made its way into
                    this country, and of which we are therefore unable to speak from our own
                    knowledge. He is also the author of many valuable memoirs on different subjects
                    in pure mathematics, in astronomy, mechanics, optics, meteorology, contained in
                    the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 12th volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Novi</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Commentarii</hi><hi rend="italic">Petro-politanae,</hi> and in
                    the volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Berlin Memoirs</hi> for 1755, 1756. In a
                    memoir contained in the last of these, is the first account of his experiments
                    on the tourmaline, which were conducted with great accuracy and judgment, and do
                    honour to the author as a man of a sound and philosophical understanding, well
                    instructed in the true principles of inductive investigation. Indeed,
                    notwithstanding the objections we have made to his theories of electricity and
                    magnetism, we must acknowledge that this is the general impression produced by
                    the perusal of his works. He appears to have been well acquainted with practical
                    astronomy, and sometimes to have had the charge of the imperial observatory. He
                    made improvements on the micrometer and the reticulum, and wrote a memoir on the
                    effects of parallax in the transit of a planet over the sun; a difficult
                    subject, and one rendered at that time (1764) peculiarly interesting, on account
                    of the transit of Venus which was just past, and that which was soon expected.
                        <hi rend="italic">(Novi Com. Pet.</hi> tom. x. p. 433.) In the same volume
                    he has a memoir on the subject of <hi rend="italic">accidental colours,</hi>
                    which at that time had hardly been treated of by any author but Buffon; and
                    another on the affinity between electricity and magnetism. In the 12th volume he
                    notices, we believe for the first time, the electric property of the Brazilian
                    emerald. He was not aware that this emerald is in reality the green tourmaline
                        <hi rend="italic">(Brogniart,</hi> tom. i. p. 418.); a variety of that
                    mineral on which he had already exercised his ingenuity with so much
                    success.</p>
                <p part="N">It is rare, in an advanced state of science, to have the satisfaction of
                    making a new discovery with regard to a subject quite elementary, and one that
                    has been long a subject of attention. This, however, happened to AEpinus with
                    respect to the <hi rend="italic">lever,</hi> and to the simplest kind of
                    lever—that which has equal arms; of which he has demonstrated a new property, in
                    the 8th volume of the <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> above referred to. It
                    is this :—If a lever with equal arms be acted on at its opposite ends by forces
                    in a given ratio to one another, and having their directions parallel to
                    straight lines given in position; and if these <pb break="no"

                    resolved eaeh into two, one at right angles to the lever, and the other in the
                    direction of it; in the ease of equilibrium, the sum of the two forees, having
                    the same direction with the lever, will be the <hi rend="italic">greatest
                        possible.</hi> This theorem, remarkable for its simplieity, and for
                    illustrating the connection between the equilibrium of bodies, and certain
                    problems concerning the maxima or minima of variable quantities, oeeurred when
                    he was pursuing some of his inquiries concerning magnetism. He seems not to have
                    been very fortunate, however, in his investigation, whieh is more complex than
                    is necessary, as the proposition admits of a geometrical demonstration
                    remarkable for its simplicity. <hi rend="smallcaps">(n.)</hi></p>
