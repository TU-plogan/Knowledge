                        St</hi></label>, bishop of Shireburn in the time of the Saxon Heptarchy. He
                    is said to have been the son of Kenred, brother to Ina, king of the West Saxons;
                    but in the opinion of William of Malmesbury, his father was no more than a
                    distant relation to the king. Having received the first part of his education in
                    the school which one Maldulph, a learned Scot, had set up in the place where
                    Malmesbury now stands, he travelled into France and Italy for his improvement.
                    At his return home he studied some time under Adrian, abbot of St Augustin’s, in
                    Canterbury, the most learned professor of the sciences who had ever been in
                    England. In these different seminaries he acquired a very uncommon stock of
                    knowledge, and became famous for his learning, not only in England, but in
                    foreign countries; whence several learned men sent him their writings for his
                    perusal and correction; particularly Prince Arcivil, a son of the king of
                    Scotland, who wrote many pieces, which he sent to Aldhelm, “entreating him to
                    give them the last polish, by rubbing off their Scotch rust.” He was the first
                    Englishman who wrote in the Latin language, both in prose and verse, and
                    composed a book for the instruction of his countrymen in the prosody of that
                    language. Besides this, he wrote several other treatises on various subjects,
                    some of which are lost, and others published by Martin Delrio and Canisius.
                    Venerable Bede, who flourished in the end of this and the beginning of the next
                    century, gives the following character of Aldhelm: “He was a man of universal
                    erudition, having an elegant style, and being wonderfully well acquainted with
                    books, both on philosophical and religious subjects.” In fact, considering the
                    cloud of ignorance by which he was surrounded, and the great difficulty of
                    acquiring knowledge without prpper instruction, Aldhelm was a very extraordinary
                    man. From one of his letters to Hedda, bishop of Winchester, concerning the
                    nature of his studies whilst at Canterbury, he appears to have been
                    indefatigably determined to acquire every species of learning in his power. For

                    ii. p. 320. King Alfred the Great declared that Aidhelm was the best of all the
                    Saxon poets; and that a favourite song, which was universally sung in his
                    time,near 200 years after its author’s death, was of his composition. When he
                    was abbot of Malmesbury, having a fine voice, and great skill in music as well
                    as poetry, and observing the backwardness of his barbarous countrymen to listen
                    to grave instructions, he composed a number of little poems, which he sung to
                    them after mass in the sweetest manner, by which they were gradually instructed
                    and civilized. After this excellent person had governed the monastery of
                    Malmesbury, of which he was the founder, about 30 years, he was made bishop of
                    Shirebum, where he died A. <hi rend="smallcaps">d.</hi> 709.—He wrote, 1. De
                    octo Vitiis principalibus. This treatise is extant in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Bibliotheca Patrum</hi> of Canisius. 2. AEnigmatum versus mille. This, with
                    several others of his poems, was published by Martin Delrio at Mentz, 1601, 8vo.
