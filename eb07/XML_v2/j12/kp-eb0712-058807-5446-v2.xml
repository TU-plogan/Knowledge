                    certain ages, eras, or periods of extraordinary length in the fabulous
                    chronology of the Hindus. They are (see Halhed’s <hi rend="italic">Preface to
                        the Code of Gentoo Laws,</hi> p. xxxvi.) four in number, viz.</p>
                <p part="N">1. The Suttee Yug, or age of purity, which is said to have lasted three
                    millions two hundred thousand years; and they hold that the life of man was
                    extended in that age to one hundred thousand years, and that his stature was
                    twenty-one cubits.</p>
                <p part="N">2. The Tirtah Yug, in which one third of mankind was corrupted, they
                    suppose to have consisted of two millions four hundred thousand years, during
                    which men lived to the age of ten thousand years.</p>
                <p part="N">3. The Dwapaar Yug, in which half of the human race became depraved,
                    endured one million six hundred thousand years, during which the life of man was
                    reduced to a thousand years.</p>
                <p part="N">4. The Collee Yug, in which all mankind were corrupted, or rather
                    lessened (for that is the true meaning of the word <hi rend="italic"
                        >Colled),</hi> is the present era, which they suppose ordained to subsist
                    four hundred thousand years, and of which nearly five thousand are already past.
                    The life of man in this period is limited to one hundred years.</p>
                <p part="N">Some account has already been given of the Indian chronology (see
                    articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Chronology</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Hindustan),</hi> and it is therefore unnecessary to recur to the subject in
                    this place. But we may nevertheless subjoin Dr Robertson’s observations on the
                    above periods, from the Notes to his <hi rend="italic">Historical Disquisition
                        concerning India.</hi> “If,” says he, <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> we
                    suppose the computation of time in the Indian chronology to be made by solar, or
                    even by lunar years, nothing can be more extravagant in itself, or more
                    repugnant to our mode of calculating the duration of the world, founded on
                    sacred and infallible authority. From one circumstance, however, which merits
                    attention, we may conclude that the information which we have hitherto received
                    concerning the chronology of the Blindas is very incorrect. We have, as far as I
                    know, only five original accounts of the different Jogues or eras of the Hindus.
                    The first is given by Μ. Rogers, who received it from the Brahmins on the
                    Coromandel coast. According to it, the Suttee Jogue is a period of one million
                    seven hundred and twenty-eight thousand years; the Tirtah Jogue is one million
                    two hundred and ninety-six thousand years; theDwapaar Jogue is eight hundred and
                    sixty-four thousand. The duration of the Collee Jogue he does not specify <hi
                        rend="italic">(Porte Ouverte,</hi> p. 179). The next is that of Μ. Bernier,
                    who received it from the Brahmins of Benares. According to him, the duration of
                    the Suttee Jogue was two millions five hundred thousand years; that of the
                    T'ir-tah Jogue, one million two hundred thousand years; that of the Dwapaar
                    Jogue is eight hundred and sixty-four thousand years. Concerning the period of
                    the Codec Jogue he is likewise silent (<hi rend="italic">Voyages,</hi> tom. ii.
                    p. 160). The third is that of Colonel Dow; according to which the Suttce Jogue
                    is a period of fourteen millions of years, the Tirtah Jogue one million and
                    eighty thousand, the Dwapaar Jogue <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:192945459?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5459-0589"/>seventy-two
                    thousand, and the Collee Jogue thirty-six thousand years <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Hist, of fīindost.</hi> vol. i. p. 2). The fourth account is that of M. le
                    Gentil, who received it from the Brahmins of the Coromandel coast; and as his
                    information was acquired in the same part of India, and derived from the same
                    source, with that of Μ. Rogers, it agrees with his in every particular (<hi
                        rend="italic">Mem. de ľ</hi><hi rend="italic">Académie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >des Sciences pour</hi> 1772, tom. ii. part i. p. 176). The fifth is the
                    account of Mr Halhed, which has been already given. From this discrepancy, not
                    only of the total numbers, but of many of the articles in the different
                    accounts, it is manifest that our information concerning Indian chronology is
                    hitherto as uncertain as the whole system of it is wild and fabulous. To me it
                    appears highly probable, that when we understand more thoroughly the principles
                    upon which the factitious eras or jogues of the Hindus have been formed, that we
                    may be more able to reconcile their chronology to the true mode of computing
                    time, founded on the authority of the Old Testament; and may likewise find
                    reason to conclude, that the account given by their astronomers, of the
                    situation of the heavenly bodies at the beginning of the Collee Jogue, is not
                    established by actual observation, but the result of a retrospective
                    calculation.”</p>
