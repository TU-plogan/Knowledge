                    Pagans. The theologists, according to Cicero, reckoned three Jupiters, the first
                    and second of whom were born in Arcadia; and of these two, the one sprang from
                    AEther, and the other from Coelus. The third Jupiter was the son of Saturn, and
                    born in Crete, where they pretended to show his sepulchre. Cicero in other
                    places speaks of several Jupiters, who reigned in different countries. The
                    Jupiter by whom the poets and mythologists understand the supreme god, was the
                    son of Saturn, king of Crete. He would have been devoured by his father as soon
                    as born, had not his mother Rhea substituted a stone instead of the child, which
                    Saturn immediately swallowed. Saturn took this method to destroy all his male
                    children, because it had been foretold by Coelus and Terra that one of his sons
                    would deprive him of his kingdom. Jupiter, being thus saved from his father’s
                    jaws, was brought up by the Curetes in a den on Mount Ida. Virgil tells us that
                    he was fed by the bees; and, out of gratitude for this service, he changed them
                    from an iron ιo a golden colour. Some say that his nurses were Amalthaea and
                    Melissa, who gave him goat’s milk and honey; and others, that Amalthaea was the
                    name of the goat which nourished him, and whieh, as a reward for her great
                    services, was changed into a constellation. According to others, he was fed by
                    wild pigeons, which brought him ambrosia from Oceanus; and by an eagle, which
                    carried nectar in his beak from a steep rock; services for which he rewarded the
                    former, by making them the foretellers of winter and summer; and the latter, by
                    giving him immortality, and making him his thunderbearer. W’hen grown up, he
                    drove his father out of heaven, and divided the empire of the world with his
                    brothers. For himself, he reserved heaven and earth; Neptune had allotted to him
                    the sca and waters; and Pluto the infernal regions. The Titans undertook to
                    destroy Jupiter, as he had done his father. These Titans were giants, the sons
                    of Titan and the Earth. They declared war against Jupiter, and heaped mountains
                    upon mountains in order to escalade heaven; but their efforts were unsuccessful,
                    Jupiter overthrew them with his thunder, and shut them up under the waters and
                    mountains, from which they were not able to escape. Jupiter had several wives.
                    The first of these, named Metis, hc is said to have destroyed in a most
                    extraordinary manner. His second was Themis; the name of his third is not known;
                    but his fourth was the celebrated Juno, whom he deceived under the form of a
                    cuckoo, which, to shun the violence of a storm, fled for shelter to her lap. He
                    was the father of the Muses and Graces, and had a prodigious number of children
                    by his mistresses. He metamorphosed himself into a satyr to enjoy Antiope; into
                    a bull, to carry off Europa; into a swan, to abuse Leda; into a shower of gold,
                    to corrupt Danäe; and into several other forms to gratify his passions. He had
                    Bacchus by Semele, Diana and Apollo by Latona, and was the father of Mercury and
                    the other gods. The heathens in general believed that there was but one supreme
                    God; but when they considered this one great being as influencing the affairs of
                    the world, they gave him as many different names; and hence proceeded their
                    variety of nominal gods. When he thundered or lightened, they called him <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:192946031?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-6031-0633"
                    />Jupiter; when he calmed the sea, Neptune; when he guided their councils,
                    Minerva; and when he gave them strength in battle, Mars. In process of time they
                    used different representations of this Jupiter, and considered them, vulgarly at
                    least, as so many different persons. They afterwards regarded each of them in
                    different views; thus, the Jupiter who showered down blessings was called the
                        <hi rend="italic">Kind</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the Jupiter who
                    punished, the <hi rend="italic">Terrible.</hi> There was also one Jupiter for
                    Europe, and another for Africa. In Europe, there was one great Jupiter who was
                    the particular friend of the Athenians, and another who was the special
                    protector of the Romans; nay, there was scarcely a town or hamlet perhaps in
                    Italy that had not a Jupiter of its own; but the Jupiter of Terracina, or
                    Jupiter Anxur, represented in medals as young and beardless, with rays round his
                    head, resembled Apollo more than the great Jupiter of the Capitol. In this way
                    Jupiter at length had different temples and different characters almost
                    everywhere. At Carthage, he was called Ammon; in Egypt, Serapis; at Athens, the
                    Olympian Jupiter; and at Rome, the Capitoline Jupiter, who was the guardian and
                    benefactor of the Romans, and whom they called the best and greatest, <hi
                        rend="italic">Jupiter</hi><hi rend="italic">optimus maximus.</hi> The figure
                    of this Jupiter was represented, in his chief temple on the Capitoline Hill, as
                    sitting on a curule chair, with the <hi rend="italic">fulmen</hi> or lightning
                    in one hand, and a sceptre in the other. This <hi rend="italic">fulmen,</hi> in
                    the figures of the old artists, was always adapted to the character under which
                    they required to represent Jupiter. If his appearance was to be mild and calm,
                    they gave him the comic <hi rend="italic">fulmen,</hi> or bundle of flames
                    wreathed close together, held down in his hand; when punishing, he held up the
                    same figure, with two transverse darts of lightning, sometimes with wings added
                    to each side of it to denote its swiftness (this was called by the poets the
                    three-forked bolt of Jove); and when he was going to do some exemplary
                    execution, they put in his hand a handful of flames, all let loose in their
                    utmost fury, and sometimes filling both his hands with flames. The superiority
                    of Jupiter was principally manifested in that air of majesty which the ancient
                    artists endeavoured to express in his countenance; particular attention being
                    paid to the head of hair, the eyebrows, and the beard. There are, on ancient
                    seals, several heads of the mild Jupiter; where his face has a mixture of
                    dignity and ease in it, admirably described by Virgil <hi rend="italic"
                        >(AEn.</hi> i. ver. 256). The statues of the Terrible Jupiter were generally
                    of black marble, as those of the former were of white; the one sitting with an
                    air of tranquillity, the other standing, more or less disturbed. The face of the
                    one is pacific and serene, of the other angry or clouded. On the head of the one
                    the hair is regular and composed; in the other it is so dishevelled that it
                    falls half way down the forehead. The face of the Jupiter Tonans resembles that
                    of the Terrible Jupiter; he is represented on gems and medals as holding up the
                    triple bolt in his right hand, and standing in a chariot which seems to be
                    whirled on impetuously by four horses. Thus he is also described by the poets
                    (Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Deiαn. Here.</hi> v. 28; Horace, lib. i. od. 4, V. 8).
                    Jupiter, as the intelligence presiding over a single planet, is represented only
                    in a chariot and pair; upon all other occasions, if represented in a chariot, he
                    is always drawn by four horses. Jupiter is well known as the chief ruler of the
                    air, whose particular province it was to direct the rains, the thunders, and the
                    lightnings. As the dispenser of rain, he was called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Jupiter</hi><hi rend="italic">Pluvius,</hi> under which character he is
                    exhibited seated in the clouds, holding up his right hand, or extending his arms
                    almost in a straight line each way, and pouring a stream of hail and rain from
                    his right hand upon the earth, whilst the <hi rend="italic">fulmen</hi> is held
                    down in his left. The wings that are given to him relate to his character of
                    presiding over the air; his hair and beard in the Antonine pillar are all spread
                    down by the rain, which descends in a sheet from him, and falls for the
                    refreshment of the Romans; whilst their enemies are represented as struck with
                    the lightnings, and lying dead at their feet.</p>
                <p part="N">Some are of opinion that the fable of Jupiter includes a great part of
                    the history of Noah and his three sons, and that Saturn is Noah, who saw all
                    mankind perish in the waters of the deluge, and who, in some sort, swallowed
                    them up, by not receiving them into the ark. Jupiter is Ham; Neptune, Japheth;
                    and Shem, Pluto. The Titans, it is thought, represent the old giants, who built
                    the tower of Babel, and whose pride and presumption God had confounded, by
                    changing their language, and pouring out the spirit of discord and division
                    amongst them. The name of <hi rend="italic">Jupiter,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >Zeus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Jovis</hi><hi rend="italic">Pater,</hi> is
                    thought to be derived from Jehovah; and in medals we meet with <hi rend="italic"
                        >Jovis</hi> in the nominative as well as oblique cases, thus, <hi
                        rend="italic">Jovis custos, Jovis propugnator, Jovis stator.</hi> To the
                    name <hi rend="italic">Jovis</hi> was added <hi rend="italic">pater -,</hi> and
                    afterwards, instead of <hi rend="italic">Zeus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Jovis
                        Pater,</hi> they used <hi rend="italic">Jupiter</hi> by abbreviation.</p>
                <p part="N">The name of Jupiter was not known to the Hebrews till the reign of
                    Alexander the Great, and the kings his successors. Antiochus Epiphanes commanded
                    the idol of Jupiter Olympius to be placed in the temple at Jerusalem; and that
                    of Jupiter the defender of strangers in the temple on Mount Gerizim (2 Macc. vi.
                    2). Whilst St Paul and St Barnabas were at Lystra, they were taken for gods,
                    because they cured one who had been lame from his birth, and that by an
                    expression only; St Paul was taken for Mercury, by reason of his eloquence, and
                    St Barnabas for Jupiter (Acts, xiv. 11, 12), on account of his goodly mien.</p>
