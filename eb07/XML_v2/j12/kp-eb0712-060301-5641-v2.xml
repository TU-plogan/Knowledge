                    is a Scotish historian of considerable reputation, but his personal history is
                    very imperfectly known. We are however informed that he was the son of an honest
                    burgess of Edinburgh, and that he was educated in the university of his native
                        city.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"

                    He took the degree of A. Μ. in the year 1587. His father may perhaps have been a
                    native of Annandale, where Johnstone is still a prevalent name. The son
                    bequeathed legacies to some of his cousins in Annandale, L.500 sterling in trust
                    to Lord Johnstone for building a bridge over the river Annan, and L.1000 in
                    trust to the same nobleman for the maintenance of a grammar school at Moffat.
                    Whether he prosecuted his studies in some foreign university, and there took his
                    degree of LL. D., we are not informed. He appears to have fixed his residence in
                    London, and to have inherited or acquired a considerable fortune. Dempster, to
                    whom we are indebted for many scattered notices of Scotish writers, has stated
                    that he was particularly esteemed by Lord Bruce of Kinloss, and, although not a
                    courtier, that he was acceptable to King James.<note anchored="true"

                    Johnstone, of the parish of St Anne, Blackffy-ers, London, Esquire.” The codicil
                    is dated on the 12th of October 1639, and probate was granted to one of his
                    executors six days afterwards; so that the testator must have died in that
                    interval. The greatest part of his property he bequeathed to charitable and
                    benevolent purposes. It is however to be suspected that his laudable intentions
                    were in some cases frustrated: the bridge was never built over the Annan, nor
                    did Moffat school derive much benefit from his legacy. He had been appointed one
                    of the executors of George Heriot; and he bequeathed L.1100 to the hospital. He
                    bequeathed L.1000 “towards the maintenance of eight poor scholars” in the
                    university of Edinburgh. The destination of his library is thus expressed: “As
                    for my books, ľdo appoint the books of humanity, Thesaurus Linguae Latinae, and
                    Lexicon Graecum, to be sent unto Moffat in Annandale, when the aforesaid school
                    is ereckted, with the Latin poets and commentaries: as for the Italian, French,
                    and Spanish books, 1 would have them changed for books of philosophy, to be sent

                <p part="N">Dr Johnstone had prepared a history of his own time; and the earliest
                    part of it, consisting of two books, appeared under the title of “Historiarum

                    Charles, and the subsequent epigram, “Ad Robertum Johnstonum Scoto-Britannum,”
                    written by John Owen:</p>

                    afterwards translated into English: “The Historie of Scotland during the

                    Middleton, author of the Appendix to Spotswood’s History. The identity of the
                    historian and of the individual who died in 1639, is established by the
                    testimony of the translator, who mentions his author’s bequest to the university
                    of Edinburgh. He has however magnified the eight exhibitions into eight
                    fellowships. The entire history at length made its appearance in an ample
                    volume: “Historia Rerum Britannicarum, ut et multarum Galli carum, Belgicarum,
                    et Germanicarum, tam politicarum quam ecclesiasticarum, ab anno 1572 ad annum
                    1628.” Amst. 1655, fol. The editor, under the signature of J. S. has prefixed a
                    very brief notice, which contains an erroneous statement of the author having
                    himself published the first two books. Buchanan’s history, according to the
                    opinion of Nicolson, has been “continu’d in the same fine language” by
                        Johnstone;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"

                    Woodhouselee describes this continuation as “a work of great merit, whether we
                    consider the judicious structure of the narrative, the sagacity of the
                    reflections, the acute discernment of characters, or the classical tincture of
                    the style. In those passages of his history where there is room for a display of
                    eloquence, he is often singularly happy in touching those characteristic
                    circumstances which present the picture strongly to the mind of the reader,
                    without a vain parade of tvords, or artificial refinement of sentiment.”<note

                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Johnstone,</hi> a modern and thriving village of
                    Scotland, in the county of Renfrew, at the distance of about three miles west
                    from Paisley. It owes its origin entirely to manufactures, as about forty years
                    ago only a few cottages stood where now is seen a town consisting of two large
                    squares, many considerable streets, and public works. It is regularly laid out,
                    there being one main street, which is crossed by others at right angles. The
                    houses are substantially built, and for the most part two stories high. There
                    are within the precincts of the place seventeen cotton mills of various extent,
                    and other three in the neighbourhood. There are also in the town two brass and
                    two extensive iron founderies; five machine manufactories, and a public
                    gas-work. Besides a chapel of ease belonging to the Scotch church, there is here
                    a United Secession and Relief church, a Universalist, and Methodist chapel. In
                    Johnstone are also a town school, a subscription library, two news-rooms, a
                    mechanics’ institution and library, and sundry benevolent and religious
                    societies. The Ardrossan Canal from Glasgow terminates in a basin at the east
                    end of the town. In its neighbourhood are four collieries, which are of great
                    advantage to a place to which coal is of essential importance. The population in
                    1811 amounted to 3647, and in 1818 to 5000.</p>
