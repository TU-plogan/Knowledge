                    several instances of the martial prowess, as well as judicial authority, of the
                    justiciar of Scotland in early times, particularly of the valiant justiciaries
                        <hi rend="italic">Buchan</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Durward,</hi> in the
                    middle of the thirteenth century. Durward, indeed, during his temporary removal
                    from office, is known to have joined the standard of King Henry HI. of England
                    in the French campaign; and Fordun’s character of him is more that of a gallant
                    military officer than a sober gownsman.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1296, a single justiciar appears for the whole kingdom, in the person
                    of Sir William de Ormesby, a justice of the Common Pleas in England, who was
                    constituted by King Edward I. lord-justiciar of Scotland; but this appointment
                    was of short continuance. In 1305, the English monarch having again put down the
                    Scotch, distributed the kingdom into four districts, and appointed for each
                    district two justices; an arrangement in which the English Justinian had
                    certainly an eye to the judicial system of England, and to the introduction of
                    justices in eyre or of assize, as delegates of the <hi rend="italic">aula
                        regia,</hi> or justice-deputes, sueh as were established in that country.
                    The death of Edward, however, soon .afterwards put an end to the project; and
                    the old practice of having two justiciars was returned to, and continued till
                    the time of King James IV., but under the designation of a justiciar <hi
                        rend="italic">north of Forth,</hi> and a justiciar of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lothian,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">south of Forth.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Soon after the fatal battle of Flodden, in the beginning of the
                    sixteenth century, the office of justiciar, or, as he was now styled,
                    justice-general (in contradistinction to the special justices now frequently
                    appointed, as well for particular places as for particular trials), came again
                    into the hands of a single individual, viz. the Earl of Argyll, in which noble
                    family it was hereditary for a century. The High Court of Justiciary, also,
                    began then to be settled at Edinburgh; whereas, before, the parliament and
                    superior courts were held chiefly north of Forth.</p>
                <p part="N">Towards the end of the same century, an alteration was made on the
                    manner of going circuit. In the time of King Robert HL, the justiciars were each
                    required to pass twice in circuit through every shire of their jurisdiction. But
                    by 1587, cap. 82, instead of passing through the realm from shire to shire
                    successively, the realm was divided into four quarters, and two senators or
                    advocates of the College of Justice were appointed as justicc-deputes for each
                    quarter. This system continued about <hi rend="italic">a</hi> century, when, by
                    1672, cap. 16, instead of the former justice-deputes, certain lords of Session
                    were constituted commissioners of Justiciary, along with the justice-general,
                    and the justice-clerk was made vice-president of the court, to preside in
                    absence of the justice-general; an arrangement which has continued to the
                    present day.</p>
                <p part="N">The jurisdiction and the powers of the justiciar of England arc known to
                    have been distributed amongst the superior courts now existing there. The
                    history of the powers possessed by the justiciar of Scotland we shall now
                    notice. In England the justiciar became a formidable officer, a terror at once
                    to the crown and the people. It does not appear that such was ever the case in
                    Scotland. This no doubt arose much from the early partition of the office into a
                    justiciary north and south oř Forth. But his great adversary was the
                    lord-chancellor, as the organ and instrument of the papal clergy, in whose hands
                    the office of chancellor had here, as in the other countries ot Europe, long
                    been vested. The high office or justiciar was the envy of the ecclesiastics,
                    always noted for their ambition; but it being forbidden them by the papal
                    constitutions, as a secular tribunal and a place of blood, they could not
                    directly seize upon it as they had done upon the office of chancellor. They
                    therefore set about filching its jurisdiction; and in 1425 the first Court of
                    Session was erected, composed of the chancellor, and with him “certaine
                    discreete persones of the three estates,” chosen by the king, with power to
                    judge in all matters competent to the king and his council. In 1503, the Court
                    of Daily Council was instituted instead of the Court of the Session; and at
                    length, in 1532, the present Court of Session and College of Justice was
                    established at Edinburgh, with a jurisdiction in all civil causes. From that
                    time forward, the civil jurisdiction of the justiciar (whose office, it will be
                    remembered, was now hereditary in the family of Argyll, and consequently feeble
                    and inefficient) ceased. And not only so, but its relative importance expired,
                    and the Court of Session became the supreme court of the kingdom; for, by
                    clerical ability, or by lay subserviency not found in England, where the old
                    common Jaw has ever continued the antagonist of Roman jurisprudence, an act
                    passed here (1540, cap. 72), requiring all sheriffs and other temporal judges to
                    copy the proceedings (not of the justiciar, as heretofore, but) of the Court of
                    Session. The triumph of the papal clergy was then complete; the old common law
                    ceased; its records became obsolete, and are to this day of apocryphal
                    authority; and the civil and canon laws became, what they were in use to be
                    denominated, the <hi rend="italic">common law of</hi> Scotland. And what the
                    Court of Session effected ∕n the civil jurisdiction of the justiciar, the Court
                    of Admiralty did in its maritime jurisdiction. That court was little known
                    before the end of the sixteenth century. About that time Mr Alexander King,
                    advocate, was appointed judge of the Admiralty; and almost immediately, owing to
                    the compilation of his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Maritime Law</hi> (perhaps
                    the earliest regular work on that branch of jurisprudence in Britain), the Court
                    of Admiralty rose to importance; and in 1681 it was declared a sovereign
                    judicature, and the high-admiral, the king’s lieutenant, and justice-general on
                    the seas. In our own day, however, the High Court of Admiralty has been
                    abolished, and the Court of Justiciary has re-acquired a criminal jurisdiction
                    on the seas. As respects the military power once possessed by the justiciar,
                    that departed from him long ago, and became vested in the army itself,
                    superintended by the crown; yet to this day a recognition of the ancient power
                    may be observed at the Justiciary circuits.</p>
                <p part="N">The supreme judicative power of Scotland is therefore now vested in the
                    Courts of Session and Justiciary. The justice-general being now wholly nominal,
                    and a sinecure, the chief judge of Justiciary is the justice-clerk, and the
                    puisne judges are certain lords of Session. The justiceclerk is also president
                    of the Second Division of the Court of Session, though, which is singular, he is
                    not necessarily a lord of Session; and by a late act of parliament, the
                    president of the Court of Session is, on the termination of the existing
                    interest, to assume the office of justice-general. In effect, therefore, though
                    in a very bungling and awkward sort of way the Court of Session will, on the act
                    in question coming into operation, take the place and jurisdiction of the
                    ancient justiciar, (u. u. u.)</p>
