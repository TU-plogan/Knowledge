                    France, who followed the opinions of Jansen or Jansenius in relation to grace
                    and predestination.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1640, the universities of Louvain and Douay, and
                    particularly Father Molina and Father Leonard Celsus, thought fit to condemn the
                    opinions of the Jesuits on grace and free will. .This having set the controversy
                    on foot, Jansenius opposed to the doctrines of the Jesuits the sentiments of St
                    Augustin, and wrote a treatise on grace, which he entitled <hi rend="italic"
                        >Augustinus.</hi> This treatise was attacked by the Jesuits, who accused
                    Jansenius of maintaining dangerous and heretical opinions, and afterwards, in
                    1642, obtained of Pope Urban VIII. a formal condemnation of the treatise; but
                    the partisans of Jansenius gave out that this bull was spurious, or, in other
                    words, composed by a person entirely devoted to the Jesuits. After the deat∣ι of
                    Urban VIII. the affair of Jansenism began to be more warndy controverted, and
                    gave birth to an infinite number<pb break="no"

                    polemical writings concerning grace. And what occasioned no little mirth was the
                    titles which each party gave to their writings; one writer published <hi

                    into, and condemnation of, the following propositions, extracted from
                    Jansenius’s <hi rend="italic">Augustinus</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> 1. Some of
                    God’s commandments are impossible to be observed by the righteous, even though
                    they endeavour with all their power to accomplish them. 2. In the state <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> corrupted nature, we are incapable of resisting inward
                    grace. 3. Merit and demerit, in a state of corrupted nature, do not depend on a
                    liberty which excludes necessity, but on a liberty which excludes constraint. 4.
                    The Semi-Pelagians admitted the necessity of an inward preventing grace for the
                    performance of each particular act, even for the beginning of faith; but they
                    were heretics in maintaining that this grace was of such a nature that the will
                    of man was able either to resist or obey it. 5. It is Semi-Pelagianism to say
                    that Jesus Christ died or shed his blood for all mankind in general.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1652, the Pope appointed a congregation for examining into
                    the dispute in relation to grace. In this congregation Janseniuswas condemned;
                    and the bull of condemnation, published in May 1653, filled all the pulpits in
                    Paris with violent outcries and alarms against the heresy of the Jansenists. In
                    the year 1656, Pope Alexander VII. issued another bull, in which he condemned
                    the five propositions of Jansenius. However, the Jansenists affirm that these
                    propositions are not to be found in his book; but that some of his enemies,
                    having caused them to be printed on a sheet, inserted them in the book, and
                    thereby deceived the pope. At last Clement XI. put an end to the dispute by his
                    constitution of the 17th July 1705, in which, after having recited the
                    constitutions of his predecessors in relation to this affair, he declares, “That
                    in order to pay a proper obedience to the papal constitutions concerning the
                    present question, it is necessary to receive them with a respectful silence.”
                    The clergy of Paris, in the same year, approved and accepted of this bull, and
                    none dared to oppose it. This is the famous bull <hi rend="italic"
                        >Unigenitus,</hi> so denominated from its beginning with the words <hi
                        rend="italic">Unigenitus</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Filius.</hi></p>
