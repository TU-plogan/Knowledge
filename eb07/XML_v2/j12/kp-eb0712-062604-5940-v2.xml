                    the World, a celebrated temple and place of Hindu worship, on the sea-coast of
                    Orissa, and district of Cuttack, near to the town of Pursolem, esteemed the most
                    sacred of all the Hindu religious establishments. It is situated a few miles to
                    the north-east of the Chilka Lake, close to the sea-shore, and, when seen from a
                    distance, is a shapeless mass of building, but forms an excellent landmark for
                    navigators in approaching so low a coast. It is surrounded by several courts or
                    inclosures, into the interior of which no European is admitted; and at the gate
                    of the outward wall are two large statues of singhs, an imaginary or fabulous
                    animal, nearly as large as an elephant. Juggernath is said to be one of the
                    incarnations oť Vishnu; but the original dedication of the temple is involved in
                    fable. It is known to have existed for above 800 years, and is mentioned as a
                    celebrated place oť Hindu worship by the oldest Mahommedan historians of India.
                    The idol itself is a huge disgusting image of the human form, made of wood, with
                    a frightful black visage, and a distended mouth foaming with blood. On each side
                    of him is another image, one part oť which is painted white, and the other
                    yellow; the first is said to be the image oť his sister Shubudra, the other that
                    of his brother Balaram. The throne of the idol is placed on a stupendous car or
                    moveable tower, about sixty feet high, resting on wheels, which, from the
                    weight, indent the ground deeply as they move along; and it is then that, in the
                    fanatical madness of his bloody superstition, devotees throw themselves under
                    the wheels and are crushed to death. The tower is drawn along by the people by
                    means oť ropes, amidst the shouts of the ignorant multitude; and upon the car
                    are the priests and attendants. The concourse of Hindu pilgrims to this shrine
                    is immense; the aged come to die at Juggernath; and so numerous are these
                    pilgrims, that the approach to it is known at the distance of fifty miles by the
                    quantity of human bones strewed on the way. The impurity of the Hindu idolatry
                    is strongly indicated by the indecent sculptures that cover the walls of the
                    temple and the sides of the machine.</p>
                <p part="N">The resort of Hindu pilgrims to Juggernath is the source of a
                    considerable revenue; and the British, by the conquest of the province of
                    Cuttack from the Mahrattas in 1803, have succeeded to all their rights as
                    sovereigns, and consequently to the right oť collecting this tax on the
                    superstition of the inhabitants. The superintendence of the temple and of its
                    interior economy was conferred on the rajah of Khoordah. The sum realized by the
                    company from this singular source of revenue is very trifling, not exceeding
                    11,000 or 12,000 rupees. The tax amounts <pb break="no"

                    to two rupees, according to the different classes of pilgrims, who are allowed
                    access to the temple from thirty to four days. The devotees of low caste are,
                    however, obliged to perform all their ceremonies on the outside of the temple. A
                    great number of pilgrims, including all devotees and religious persons, are
                    admitted gratuitously to the temple. Merchants and traders have access to the
                    town of Parsottom, which is adjacent to the idol; but they have no access to the
                    temple except by permission. One of the chief periods of pilgrimage is in March,
                    when the Dole Jattrah takes place; and the other in July, when the Ruth Jattrah
                    is celebrated. The travelling distance from Calcutta it 311 miles, from Benares
                    512. from Madras 719, from Delhi 910, and from Bombay 1052 miles. Long. 86. 5.
