                    of Rome in 369. This obliged him to go to Jerusalem, where he applied himself to
                    the study ot the Hebrew language, in order to acquire a more perfect know ledge
                    of the Holy Scriptures; and about this time he consented to be ordained, on
                    condition that he should not be confined to any particular church. In 381, he
                    went to Constantinople to hear Gregory Nazianzen, and the following year
                    returned to Rome, where he was made secretary to Pope Damasus. He then
                    instructed many Roman ladies in piety and the knowledge of the sciences, which
                    exposed him to the calumnies of those whom he zealously reproved for their
                    irregularities; and Pope Siricius not having all the esteem for him to which his
                    learning and virtue justly entitled him, this learned doctor left Rome, and
                    returned to the monastery of Bethlehem, where he employed himself in writing
                    against those whom he called heretics, especially Vigilantins and Jovinian. He
                    had a quarrel w ith John of Jerusalem and Rufinus about the Origcnists. St
                    Jerome was the first who wrote against Pelagius. He died on the 30th of
                    September 420, at about eighty years of age. There have been several editions of
                    his works; the last, which is that of Verona, is in eleven vols, folio. His
                    principal works are, 1. A Latin version of the Holy Scriptures, distinguished by
                    the name of the <hi rend="italic">Pulgate;</hi> 2. Commentaries on the Prophets,
                    Ecclesiastes, St Matthew’s Gospel, and the Epistles to the Galatians, Ephesians,
                    Titus, and Philemon; 3. Polemical treatises against Montanus, Helvidius,
                    Jovinian, Vigilantius, and Pelagius; 4. Letters; 5. A treatise on the lives and
                    writings of the ecclesiastical authors who had flourished before his time. The
                    style of St Jerome is lively and animated, sometimes rising to the sublime.</p>

                    called from the place of his birth in Bohemia. He was neither a monk nor a
                    clergyman, but had received a learned education. Having embraced the opinions of
                    John Hnss, he began to propagate them in the year 1480. In the mean time the
                    council of Nice kept a watchful eye over him, and, considering him as a
                    dangerous person, cited him to appear before them and give an account of his
                    faith. In obedience to this citation, he went to Constance; but on his arrival,
                    in 1415, finding Huss in prison, he set out for his own country. Being seized on
                    the way, imprisoned, and examined, however, he was so intimidated that he
                    retracted, and pretended to approve of the condemnation of the opinions of
                    Wickliff and Huss. But he recanted his retractation, which, on the 26th of May
                    1416, he condemned in these terms: “I am not ashamed to confess here publicly my
                    weakness. Yes, with horror I confess my base cowardice. It was only the dread of
                    the punishment by fire which drew me to consent, against my conscience, to the
                    condemnation of the doctrine of Wickliff and Huss.” Accordingly sentence was
                    passed on him, in pursuance of which he was delivered to the secular arm, and
                    burned, in 1416. He was a person of great parts, learning, and elocution.</p>
