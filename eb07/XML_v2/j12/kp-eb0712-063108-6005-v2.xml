                    western coast of the Malay peninsula, and situated at the southeast extremity of
                    the Bay of Bengal. It is divided from the continent by a narrow isthmus of sand
                    about a mile in length and half a mile in breadth, which is covered only at high
                    water, the tide rising in the springs about ten feet. The island is about forty
                    miies in length by fifteen in breadth, and has several small islands near it
                    from one to six miles in cireumferenee. There is another island sixteen miles
                    east, named Pulo Pinjang, or Long Island, being twenty-three miles in length by
                    eight in breadth, and divided from the main by a strait having two fathoms of
                    water in the narrowest part. On the north side of the island is an excellent
                    harbour, called Popra, which may be entered over a mud bar, during the
                    springtides, by ships drawing twenty feet water. The anchorage round the island
                    is generally good, with a mud bottom. A considerable trade was formerly carried
                    on here, previously to the establishment of Prince of Wales’ Island, in the
                    Buggess prows, who resorted to Jnnkseylori in great numbers, and brought various
                    mixed cargoes to sell for tin. It is still occasionally visited by country ships
                    from Calcutta in their voyage eastward, which import coarse cutlery, China-ware,
                    iron in bars, looking-glasses, opium, pieee-goods, steel in faggots, tobacco,
                    woollens, &amp;c. From Prince of Wales’ Island also are imported opium and
                    piece-goods, and in return tin, edible bird-nests, which are found on the rocky
                    eoasts of the island, biehe-de-mer, and elephants’ teeth, are received. This
                    island is noted for the production of tin, whieh is raised by the natives, and
                    smelted by a Chinese, who farms the privilege from government. In 1782, when it
                    was visited by numerous native traders, the mines yielded an average of 500 tons
                    per annum. All kinds of coin are current, but the preference is given to Spanish
