                <p part="N"><label type="entry">EBONY</label>, a species of wood, exceedingly hard
                    and heavy, susceptible of a very fine polish, and on that account used in mosaic
                    and inlaid works, toys, and the like. There are different kinds of ebony, but
                    the most usual amongst us are black, red, and green, and almost all of them the
                    product of the island of Madagascar, where the natives call them indifferently
                        <hi rend="italic">hazon mainthi,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">black wood.</hi>
                    The island of Mauritius likewise furnishes part of the ebonies used in Europe.
                    Authors and travellers give very different accounts of the tree which yields the
                    black ebony. According to some of their descriptions, it would appear to be a
                    sort of palm tree; but according to others, a cytisus. The most authentic of
                    these is that of Falcourt, who resided many years in Madagascar as governor. He
                    assures us that it grows very high and large, its bark being black, and its
                    leaves resembling those of our myrtle, of a deep dusky green colour. Tavernier
                    says that the islanders always take care to bury their trees when cut down, in
                    order to make them blacker, and to prevent their splitting when wrought. Plumier
                    mentions another black ebony tree, discovered by him at St Domingo, which he
                    calls <hi rend="italic">sρar-tiunι</hi><hi rend="italic">portulaca foliis
                        aculeatum ebeni</hi><hi rend="italic">materia.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Pliny and Dioscorides state that the best ebony comes from Ethiopia, and
                    the worst from India; but Theophrastus prefers that of India. Black ebony is
                    much preferred to that of other colours. The best is a jet black, free of veins
                    and rind, very massive, astringent, and of an acrid pungent taste. Its rind,
                    infused in water, is said to purge pituita, and cure venereal disorders; and
                    hence Matthiolus took guaiacum for a sort of ebony. It yields an agreeable
                    perfume when laid on burning coals; when green it readily takes fire from the
                    abundance of its fat. If rubbed against a stone it becomes brown. The Indians
                    make statues to their gods and sceptres for their princes out of this wood. It
                    was first brought to Rome by Pompey after he had subdued Mithridates. It is now
                    much less used amongst us than anciently, since the discovery of so many ways of
                    giving other hard woods a black colour.</p>
                <p part="N">As to the green ebony, besides Madagascar and the Mauritius, it grows
                    likewise in the Antilles, and especially in the isle of Tobago. The tree which
                    yields it is very bushy; its leaves are smooth, and of a fine green colour.
                    Beneath its bark there is a white blea, about two inches thick; and all beneath
                    this, to the very heart, is a deep green, approaching towards a black, though
                    sometimes streaked with yellow veins. Its use is not confined to mosaic work; it
                    is likewise employed in dyeing, as yielding a fine green tincture. As to red
                    ebony, called also <hi rend="italic">grenadilla,</hi> we know little more of it
                    than the name.</p>
