                <p part="N"><label type="entry">ELLIPTOGRAPH</label>, an instrument for drawing
                    ellipses. The trammel is an instrument which has long been known and used for
                    describing ellipses. On the principle of the trammel Mr Farey constructed his
                    elliptograph in a form much more commodious for drawing. Mr Farey’s elliptograph
                    is represented at Plate CCXVIII. fig. 5. The circle A slides between the two
                    parallel rulers D, E. The circle B slides between two parallel rulers F, G, at
                    right angles to the former. In this way, if a line joining the centres of the
                    circles is made to revolve, M, the extremity of that line, will describe an
                    ellipse in the same manner as the extremity E of the line CDE, fig. 1, does in
                    the trammel. The elliptograph may be considered as a trammel, in which the pins
                    C and D, fig. 1, are enlarged into the circles A and B, fig. 5. The pinion at K,
                    fixed to one of the arms of the lower circle, acting on a rack screwed to the
                    upper circle, serves to alter the distance of the centres of the circles A and
                    B; and, by so doing, this pinion serves to vary the eccentricity of the ellipses
                    which the instrument describes. When the centres of the circles A, B coincide,
                    the describing pen M draws a circle. When the centres are removed from each
                    other, and on the circles being turned round, an ellipse is described by the
                    pen; and when the distance of the centres in increased, the eccentricity of the
                    ellipse is increased. When the pen is at the centre it describes a straight
                    line, continually moving to and fro on that line when the circles are turned
                    round. The two circles are fixed together by screws, and can only be made to
                    slide the upper circle over the lower by the action of the pinion K. The pinion
                    at L moves a rack, by which the describing pen</p>
                <p part="N">M, which draws the ellipse, is brought nearer to the centre for the
                    purpose of drawing a small ellipse, and removed farther from the centre of the
                    ellipse when a large one is to be drawn. The size of the ellipse may be
                    increased as far as the size of the instrument will admit. The pair of rulers D,
                    E are placed below the pair F, G, as is seen in fig. 6. The instrument, when
                    used, is held upon the paper with the thumb and a finger of the left hand at the
                    nuts</p>
                <p part="N">N, 0; and the circles are moved by applying the right hand to the pins/;
                    the pen M, pressing by its weight on the paper, then describes the ellipse.</p>
                <p part="N">Fig. 7 shows H, the socket for the compasses, with the centre pin on
                    which the socket moves; and the pinion L and rack <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> for
                    moving along the frame <hi rend="italic">g</hi> between the bars; and the other
                    pinion K, for separating the circles.</p>
                <p part="N">The ruler P has two points, to fix the instrument to the paper. The
                    rulcr is united to the frame by screws, which serve to adjust the position of
                    the instrument after the ruler has been fixed to the paper.</p>
                <p part="N">By means of the elliptograph any ellipse can be described, of which the
                    long and short axes are given, provided it does not exceed the size of the
                    instrument. When an ellipse is to be described, draw on the paper the longer and
                    shorter axes, bisecting each other; place the instrument on the paper, so that
                    the centre of the four rulers appears to coincide with the centre or the
                    intersection of the two axes of the ellipse; and fix the instrument in this
                    situation by the points that go into the paper. By the pinion L move the pen to
                    one extremity of the short axis of the ellipse; turn the circles half round, to
                    see if the pen comes to the other end of the short axis; if it does not, adjust
                    the error onc half, by moving the pen by the pinion L, the other half by moving
                    the frame on the paper; continue this adjustment till the pen, setting out from
                    the one end of the short axis, arrives in a half revolution at the other end.
                    Next, by means of the pinion K, bring the pen to one end of the long axis of the
                    ellipse; turn the circles half round, and if the pen reaches the other extremity
                    of the long axis of the ellipse, the instrumentis rectified; if not, one half of
                    the error is to be corrected by moving the circles by means of the pinion K, and
                    the other half by moving the instrument to a side on the paper, by means of the
                    nuts N, 0. The instrument is now adjusted, and the pen resting on the paper
                    traces the ellipse required when the circles are turned round by the
                    handles.</p>
                <p part="N">An instrument similar to the elliptograph has. been employed for
                    engraving ellipses on copper plates, and for dividing these ellipses accurately,
                    so as to give the perspective representation of a circle divided into equal
                    parts, both in the case where the distance of the eye is limited, and in the
                    orthographic projection. The Society for Encouraging Arts rewarded Mr Farey with
                    their gold medal for his invention, and a description of the elliptograph is
                    contained in the thirty-first volume of the Transactions of that society. <hi
