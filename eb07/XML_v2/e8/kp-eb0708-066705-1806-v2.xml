                <p part="N"><label type="entry">ELGIN</label> is the capital of Moray or Elginshire.
                    It is a royal burgh, and returns a member to parliament along with Banff,
                    Cullen, Peterhead, Inverury, and Kintore, Elgin being the returning burgh. It is
                    a very thriving and improving town, containing about 5600 inhabitants. In
                    approaching from Fochabers on the east, the traveller, viewing it from the
                    bridge of Llanbryde, is struck with its beautiful appearance and fine situation.
                    The town lies at the foot of the Lady Hill, and is overlooked by an elegant
                    modern building, Gray’s Hospital, with the Quarrywood Hill beyond, clothed with
                    wood to the summit, the lower parts being covered with fine copses. The town
                    chiefly consists of one principal street, named the High Street, with a few
                    smaller ones intersecting it at various distances. The High Street is upwards of
                    a mile in length from the New Institution to Gray’s Hospital, which form
                    beautiful terminations to it on the east and west. It is handsome and well
                    paved, possessing many good houses and some rather elegant shops. Its width in
                    the middle is so considerable, that a fine new church, lately built, stands in
                    the middle of it, on the site of the old church of St Giles, and close to the
                    Jail and Court-House, which are now about to be removed. Besides the new church,
                    Elgin possesses various handsome public buildings, namely, the Academy, Gray’s
                    Hospital, Anderson’s Institution, Trinity Lodge Rooms, Gas Works, &amp;c. The
                    Academy stands on the south side of the town, in a well-aired and central
                    situation, and has become justly celebrated as one of the best in the north of
                    Scotland. This academy is in a highly flourishing state in every respect, and is
                    attended by nearly three hundred scholars of both sexes. A rector presides over
                    the classical department; another master over that of mathematics and
                    arithmetic, geography, &amp;c.; and the third teaches English and elocution;
                    whilst Mr Forbes, the Roman Catholic clergyman, unconnected with the Academy,
                    gives private lessons in French and Italian. Gray’s Hospital is a spacious and
                    handsome edifice, surmounted with a dome, which, however, appears rather heavy
                    and cumbersome. It stands on a gentle eminence at the west end of the High
                    Street; it was built in 1816, and cost upwards of L.6000; and it contains from
                    ten to thirty patients. Adjoining to this hospital a small Lunatic Asylum is now
                    constructing, at the expense of the county; it is to be supported by annual
                    contributions and voluntary donations, and attended by the hospital physicians.
                    Anderson’s Institution, for the education of youth and the support of old age,
                    stands at the east end of the town. Its founder, the late General* Anderson of
                    the East India Company’s service, was a native of Elgin, and at his death, a few
                    years ago, bequeathed the bulk of his fortune, L.70,000, for the erection and
                    support of this magnificent and truly benevolent institution, which was opened
                    in 1833. This is a chaste and elegant pile of building, having a very handsome
                    front, with pillars, and being surmounted by a dome, with an entablature, and
                    piece of sculpture representing the benevolent founder in an attitude
                    corresponding to his character. It contains ample accommodation for all
                    connected with the establishment, and is capable of receiving many more, both
                    old and young, than it now contains, when its revenue shall admit of an increase
                    of numbers. In the construction of this building, as well as the new church, the
                    beautiful free-stone of which they are built, and for which Morayshire is so
                    famed, is shown to the greatest advantage. An infant school has also been lately
                    opened, and is well attended. Trinity Lodge Rooms is a very handsome building in
                    the North Street, and affords excellent accommodation for public meetings. The
                    old Jail and Court-House, standing in the middle of the High Street, only
                    deserves notice as being perhaps one of the worst in the kingdom; but there is
                    at length a prospect of its being speedily removed, and better and more suitable
                    accommodation provided both for the prisoners and courts of justice; notice
                    having been already given that the town and county mean to apply for leave to
                    obtain an act of parliament for the erection of a new one, in a better situation
                    than the present.</p>
                <p part="N">The ruins of the cathedral, which was founded in 1224, once the most
                    magnificent, and still one of the finest in the kingdom, is situated at the
                    eastern extremity of the town. This noble cathedral was first destroyed by the
                    Earl of Buchan. It was again rebuilt by the bishops of Moray; but in 1568 it was
                    unroofed by order of the Regent Morton, for the sake of the lead. The ruins of
                    this beautiful edifice have been lately put into excellent keeping, by order of
                    the barons of exchequer. Around the cathedral stands the bishop’s town house,
                    now the property of the Duke of Gordon, whose family burial-place is in the
                    cathedral; and also those of the dean and canons. The ruins of the Grey-Friars
                    are on the south side of the town, and adjoining to the field where those of the
                    old <hi rend="italic">Maison</hi><hi rend="italic">Dieu</hi> were to be seen
                    until very lately. At the west end of the town, the pretty green mount called
                    Lady Hill affords an extensive and delightful view over the town and country,
                    almost to Fochabers and the Spey. This hill bears distinct traces of having been
                    an ancient <pb break="no" facs="nls:193331819?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0708-1819-0668"/> fortification. It is said to have been used
                    as a hunting seat by one of the Malcolms. The ruins show that it was built of
                    stone and run lime, as used in early ages, and that the walls must have been of
                    considerable thickness.</p>
                <p part="N">The trade of this town is at present not very considerable. A
                    flourishing woollen manufactory has been carried on for many years, and employs
                    fifty hands, chiefly in making blankets, plaiding, shawls, and drugget. There
                    are likewise tan-works; and the glovers and sutors of Elgin were in former times
                    famous for their extensive dealings at markets. Shoemakers are still a numerous
                    body, and manufacture largely for the markets, which are held weekly on Fridays,
                    and monthly on Tuesdays, the latter being for cattle and horses. The want of a
                    good harbour at Lossiemouth, which is five miles distant, has long been a
                    drawback to the increase of trade; but measures are now in progress to construct
                    a new harbour, which, if successful, will give a great facility to the merchants
                    in gętting their goods directly from London, and to the farmers and
                    corn-merchants in shipping grain, from twenty to thirty thousand bolls of which
                    are exported from Morayshire annually. There is a literary association,
                    combining the formation of a library with a public news-room, to which there are
                    numerous subscribers; and a circulating library, established forty years ago by
                    Mr Forsyth, and still successfully carried on by Forsyth and Young. There is
                    also a mechanics’ library, and one belongiug to the academy, all highly useful
                    establishments; and there is a weekly newspaper, the Elgin Courier, which has
                    been published for five or six years.</p>
                <p part="N">Of benevolent institutions, several highly useful ones may be
                    enumerated. A savings bank was instituted some years ago, and has been found to
                    answer admirably. An excellent institution for female industry was lately
                    formed, and has been found of great utility. Besides the Established Church,
                    there is a Scotch Episcopal, an Anti-burghcr, and two Relief Chapcls, with a few
                    Roman Catholics. The improvements recently carried on in this town are numerous
                    and considerable. A joint-stock company for lighting the streets and houses of
                    the town with gas was formed about three years ago. Of late years several
                    handsome new streets have been built, and on the south and west sides of the
                    town many handsome villas and cottages have also been erected.</p>
                <p part="N">The town of Elgin is undoubtedly very ancient. By some historians its
                    name is said to have been derived from Helgy, a Norwegian chief, who in the
                    ninth century overran Morayshire. Other accounts derive it from the Saxon <hi
                        rend="italic">Hely,</hi> or Holy, and Dun, a hill. At the present time,
                    perhaps, there are few towns in Scotland which possess equal attractions as a
                    place of residence.</p>
