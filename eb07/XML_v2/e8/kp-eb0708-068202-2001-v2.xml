                    an eminent mathematician, was born on the 14th May 1701, at Hurworth, a village
                    about three miles south of Darlington; at least it is certain that he resided
                    here from his childhood. His father Dudley Emerson taught a school, and was a
                    tolerable proficient in mathematics; and without his books and instructions,
                    perhaps his son’s genius, though eminently fitted for mathematical
                    disquisitions, would have never been unfolded. The latter was instructed in the
                    learned languages by a young clergyman, then curate of Hurworth, who was boarded
                    at his father’s house. In the earlier part of his life he attempted to teach a
                    few scholars’; but, whether from his concise method of explaining his ideas, in
                    which he was not happy, or from the warmth of his natural temper, he made no
                    progress in his school; he therefore soon left it off, and, satisfied with a
                    moderate competence left him by his parents, he devoted himself to a studious
                    retirement. Towards the close of the year 1781, being sensible of his
                    approaching dissolution, he disposed of the whole of his mathematical library to
                    a bookseller at York; and on the 20th of May 1782 he died of a lingering and
                    painful disorder, at his native village, in the eighty-first year of his
                    age.</p>
                <p part="N">Mr Emerson in his person was rather short, but strong and well made,
                    with an open countenance and ruddy complexion. He was exceedingly singular in
                    his dress and manners, and his appearance, which was rather clownish, if not
                    boorish, did not bespeak the man of science; but his eccentricities were more
                    than atoned for by the uncompromising independence of his character, and by the
                    possession of strong natural parts, of which he has left ample evidence in his
                    writings. He always walked up to London when he had any thing to publish, and
                    revised it sheet by sheet himself. It was a favourite maxim with him to trust no
                    eyes but his own. He never advanced any mathematical proposition which he had
                    not first tried in practice, constantly making all the different parts himself
                    on a small scale, so that his house was filled with all kinds of mechanical
                    instruments together or disjointed. Fishing was a diversion which he was
                    remarkably fond of, and while engaged in it he would frequently stand up to his
                    middle in water. He used to study incessantly for some time, and then seek
                    relaxation by taking a ramble to any potale-house where he could get any body to
                    drink with and talk to. The Duke of Manchester was highly pleased with his
                    company, and used often to come to him in the fields and accompany him home, but
                    could never persuade him to get into a carriage. He was a married man, and his
                    wife used to spin on an old-fashioned wheel, of which a very accurate drawing is
                    given in his Mechanics. He was deeply skilled in the science of music, the
                    theory of sounds, and the various scales both ancient and modern, but as a
                    performer he had nothing to boast of.</p>
