                    Portuguese, and of a good family. He served with reputation in the East Indies
                    for five years under Albuquerque, and in 1510 he greatly distinguished himself
                    at the battle of Malacca. Deeming his services poorly repaid by his own court,
                    he entered into the employment of Charles V. king of Spain. He has been charged
                    with peculation by some of his countrymen, who assign this as the reason why he
                    quitted Portugal. In conjunction with Ruy Folero he formed the bold design of
                    discovering a new passage by the west to the Molucca Islands, which, he offered
                    to prove, fell within the division of the globe assigned by the pope to the
                    crown of Castille. It is said that he first proposed this enterprise to Emanuel
                    king of Portugal, who rejected it, as opening a way for other nations to have
                    access to the East Indies, the trade of which was then monopolized by the
                    Portuguese. The proposition was agreed to by the king of Spain, and, on the 20th
                    of September 1519, Magellan sailed from San Lucar, with five ships and 236 men
                    under his command. His officers soon murmured at this appointment, considering
                    it as a disgrace to be commanded by a renegade Portuguese; and when the fleet
                    was lying at a port in South America, which they named San Julian, a conspiracy
                    was formed against him by three of the captains, but he discovered and quelled
                    it. He caused the captain of one of <pb break="no"

                    to be put to death, he boarded a second and secured the mutineers, and the third
                    submitted.</p>
                <p part="N">The coast on which they lay was that of Patagonia; and this first voyage
                    contains accounts of the extraordinary stature of the natives. About the end of
                    October they reached a cape to which they gave the name of De las Virgines,
                    forming the entrance of the straits which now bear the name of Magellan. He
                    exerted all his authority to induce his men to venture on this unknown passage,
                    with the view of crossing a vast ocean beyond it, at the hazard of running short
                    of provisions, of which a supply for three months was all that he had remaining.
                    One of his ships abandoned him, and made the best of her way to Europe. But the
                    rest proceeded, and on the 27th of November they discovered the South Sea, which
                    made Magellan shed tears of joy. They continued their voyage across this ocean,
                    now visited for the first time by Europeans, and were not long in suffering
                    those evils from famine which they had apprehended. The men were reduced to the
                    necessity of eating the hides with which the rigging was covered. The weather
                    proved so uniformly calm and temperate, that they gave to the ocean the name ļof
                        <hi rend="italic">Pacific.</hi> On the 6th of March they came in sight of
                    the Ladrones, so called from the thievish disposition of the inhabitants; and
                    thence they sailed to the Philippines. At Zebu, Magellan obtained with little
                    difficulty the conversion of the king; and, on condition of his becoming a
                    vassal bf Spain, the Portuguese assisted him in reducing some neighbouring
                    chieftains, and the cross was erected over 'some burned villages.</p>
                <p part="N">I With about fifty men Magellan landed upon Matan, the phief of which
                    had refused to submit to Zebu, and an engagement took place between them, which
                    lasted for the greater part of the day. His troops having spent all their
                    ammunition, found it necessary to retreat, during which Magellan rvas wounded in
                    the leg by an arrow, beaten [down, and at last slain with a lance. This happened
                    in 1521. By this act of imprudence he lost the honour of being the first
                    circumnavigator of the globe, which fell to įhe lot of Cano, who brought his
                    ship home by the East ⅛ndics∙ Yet Magellan has secured an immortal name imongst
                    maritime discoverers, by the commencement of This great enterprise, in which he
                    displayed extraordinary skill and resolution, but disregarded justice and
                    humanity.</p>

                    and thence to the East Indies. Other navigators have passed the same way; but as
                    these straits are exceedingly difficult, and subject to storms, it has been
                    Common to sail round by Cape Horn, rather than through lie Straits of
