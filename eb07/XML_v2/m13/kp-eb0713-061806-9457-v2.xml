                    Scripture, containing the history of Judas and his brothers, and their wars
                    against the Syrian kings in defence of their religion and liberties, so called
                    from Judas Mattathias, surnanιcd <hi rend="italic">Maccabaeus,</hi> as some say
                    from the word '□□n, formed of the initials of .'nrτ ’ ∙ öbĸa rτ□n□ -n, <hi
                        rend="italic">Who is like unto thee, O Lord, amongst the gods,</hi> which
                    was the motto of his standard; and hence those who combated under his banner
                    were called <hi rend="italic">Maccabees,</hi> and the name was generally applied
                    to all who had suffered in the cause of the true religion, under the Egyptian or
                    Syrian kings. The first book of the Maccabees is an excellent history, and comes
                    the nearest to the style and manner of the sacred historians. It was originally
                    written in the Chaldaic tongue, and was extant in that language in the time of
                    St Jerome. From the Chaldaic it was translated into Greek, from the Greek into
                    the Latin. It is supposed to have been written by John Hyrcanus, the son of
                    Simon, who was prince and high priest of the Jews for nearly thirty years, and
                    began his government at the time where this history ends. It contains the
                    history of forty years, from the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes to the death of
                    Simon the high priest; that is, from the year of the world 3829 to the year
                    3869, or 131 years before Christ. The second book of the Maccabees begins with
                    two epistles sent from the Jews of Jerusalem to the Jews of Egypt and
                    Alexandria, to exhort them to observe the feast of the dedication of the new
                    altar erected by Judas on his purification of the temple. The first was written
                    in the 169th year of the era of the Seleucidae, that is, 144 before Christ; and
                    the second in the 188th year of the same era, or 125 before Christ. After these
                    epistles follows the preface of the author to his history, which is an
                    abridgment of a larger work, composed by one Jason, a Jew of Cyrene, who wrote
                    in Greek the history of Judas Maccabaeus and his brethren, and the wars against
                    Antiochus Epiphanes, and Eupator his son. The second book does not by any means
                    equal the accuracy and excellence of the first. It contains a history of about
                    fifteen years, from the execution of the commission of Heliodorus, who was sent
                    by Seleucus to fetch away the treasures of the temple, to the victory obtained
                    by Judas Maccabaeus over Nicanor; that is, from the year of the world 3828 to
                    the year 3843, or 147 years before Christ.</p>
                <p part="N">There are in the Polyglot Bibles, both of Paris and London, Syriac
                    versions of both these books; but they, as well as the English versions which we
                    have amongst the apocryphal books in our Bible, are all derived from the Greek.
                    There is also a third book of the Maccabees, containing the history of the
                    persecution of Ptolemy Philopator against the Jews in Egypt, and their
                    sufferings under it, which appears to have been written by some Alexandrian Jew
                    in the Greek language, not long after the time of Siracides. It is in most of
                    the ancient manuscript copies of the Greek Septuagint, particularly in the
                    Alexandrian and the Vatican, but was never inserted into the vulgar Latin
                    version of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209470?mode=fullsize"

                    English copies. Moreover, Josephus’s history of the martyrs who suffered under
                    Antiochus Epiphanes is found in some manuscript Greek Bibles, under the
                    appellation of the fourth “book of the <hi rend="italic">Maccabees.</hi></p>
