                        Jacob</hi></label>, was descended of an ancient and honourable family, and
                    born at Delft, in Holland, on the 27th of September 1688. The name of his family
                    was properly Storm van s’Gravesande. He studied the civil law at Leyden; but the
                    mathematics, for which he had evinced an early inclination, were his favourite
                    pursuit. When he had taken his doctor’s degree in 1707, he settled at the Hague,
                    where he practised at the bar, and cultivated the acquaintance of learned men.
                    In the month of May 1713, he, in conjunction with a society of young men
                    distinguished for their acquirements, undertook the composition of a periodical
                    review entitled <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Littéraire,</hi> which was continued without interruption
                    until the year 1722. In 1715, 'sGravesande, in the capacity of secretary of
                    legation, accompanied the deputies of the states-general, sent to London to
                    compliment George I. on his accession to the throne; and having there formed a
                    connection with Dr Burnet, bishop of Salisbury, he was admitted a member of the
                    Royal Society. He returned the following year to the Hague, and, in 1715, was
                    appointed ordinary professor of mathematics and astronomy in the academy of
                    Leyden. During the vacations of 1721 and 1722, 'sGravesande made two journeys to
                    Cassel to visit the landgrave of Hesse, a prince who showed an enlightened taste
                    for experimental philosophy, and generously promoted its advancement. In 1724,
                    he resigned the rectorship of the academy, to which he had previously been
                    promoted, and on this occasion pronounced a discourse <hi rend="italic"
