                            Christopher</hi></label>, an eminent musical composer, was born in the
                    Upper Palatinate, on the frontiers of Bohemia, in 1714. He commenced his studies
                    at Prague, and at a very early period of life distinguished himself by the
                    proficiency he had acquired upon several musical instruments, particularly the
                    violoncello. In Italy, whither he went in the service of a nobleman, he received
                    instructions from Martini, and produced his first opera at Milan. He came to
                    England in the year 1745. The rebellion having then just broke out, foreigners
                    were regarded with jealousy, and the opera was on that account closed; but
                    through the exertions of Lord Middlesex it was reopened with a temporary
                    political performance, called <hi rend="italic">La Caduta de’</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Giganti,</hi> the music of which Gluck was employed to
                    compose. He afterwards brought out his <hi rend="italic">Piτa-mo c Tisbe,</hi>
                    which was little else than an assemblage of favourite airs from his previous
                    works. The cold reception this opera met with first convinced him that music, to
                    be effective, must be strictly adapted to the spirit and character of the
                    poetical subject. This consideration induced Gluck to lay down certain general
                    principles, which are said to have influenced all his subsequent labours in
                    composition. These were, first, to impart to music all the force and expression
                    it is capable of producing, and which was best attained by uniting it to the
                    simple but animated poetry, ftdl of natural and well-defined ideas; secondly, to
                    make the air follow the rhythm and accents of the words, and construct the
                    accompaniments so as to invigorate the sentiment, or contrast them with it. The
                    system he adopted may be described as one entirely subservient to the effect of
                    dramatic performance, where the music is never estranged from the scene and
                    situations of the characters, and where the interest results from the perfect
                    interfusion of sound with sense.</p>
                <p part="N">His unsuccessful attempts in England at length induced Gluck again to
                    visit Italy, where he found leisure to cultivate his taste both in music and
                    poetry. In pursuance of his new design, he studied the classical Italian poets,
                    and derived from their writings more enlarged ideas as to the effects which
                    might be elicited by the union of poetry with music. His darling object now was
                    to connect himself, and act in conjunction, with some man of true poetic genius;
                    and Gluck was so fortunate as to find such a co-operator in the person of
                    Calzabigi, who undertook to write dramas exactly to his taste. In the following
                    extract from the dedication of <hi rend="italic">Alceste,</hi> Gluck assigned
                    his reasons for deviating from the beaten track; and describes his ideas on
                    operatic composition with much force and perspicuity. “When I undertook to set
                    this poem, it was my design to divest the music entirely of all those abuses
                    with which the vanity of singers, or the too great complacency of composers, has
                    so long disfigured the Italian opera, and rendered the most beautiful and
                    magnificent of all public exhibitions the most tiresome and ridiculous. It was
                    my intention to confine music to its true dramatic province, of assisting
                    poetical expression, and of augmenting the interest of the fable, without
                    interrupting the action, or chilling it with useless and superfluous ornaments;
                    for the office of music, when joined to poetry, seemed to me to resemble that of
                    colouring in a correct and well-disposed design, where the lights and shades
                    only seem to animate the figures, without altering the outline. I determined,
                    therefore, not to stop an actor in the heat of a spirited dialogue, for a
                    tedious rito- <hi rend="italic">ruel</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> nor
                    to. impede the progress of passion, by lengthening<pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193521637?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0710-1637-0590"/> a single
                    syllable of a favourite word, merely to display agility of throat; and I was
                    equally inflexible in my resolution not to employ the orchestra to so poor a
                    purpose as that of giving time for the recovery of breath, sufficient for a long
                    and unmeaning cadence. I never thought it necessary to hurry through the second
                    part of a song, though the most impassioned and important, in order to repeat
                    the words of the first part regularly four times, merely to finish the air where
                    the sense is unfinished, and to give an opportunity to the singer of showing
                    that he has the impertinent power of varying passages, and disguising them, till
                    they shall be no longer known to the composer himself. In short, I tried to
                    banish all those vices of the musical drama, against which good sense and reason
                    have in vain so long exclaimed. I imagined, that the overture ought to prepare
                    the audience for the action of the piece, and serve as a kind of argument to it;
                    that the instrumental accompaniment should be regulated by the interest of the
                    drama, and not leave a void in the dialogue between the air and recitative; that
                    they should neither break into the sense and connection of a period, nor
                    wantonly interrupt the energy or heat of the action. And, lastly, it was my
                    opinion, that my first and chief care, as a dramatic composer, was to aim at a
                    noble simplicity; and I have accordingly shunned all parade of unnatural
                    difficulty in favour of clearness, nor have I sought or studied novelty, if it
                    did not arise naturally from the situation of the character and poetical
                    expression; and there is no rule of composition which 1 have not thought it my
                    duty to sacrifice, in order to favour passion and produce effects.”</p>
                <p part="N">The opera of <hi rend="italic">Orjèo</hi> was the first attempt of Gluck
                    in the new course he had shaped out for himself. It was produced at Vienna, and
                    at first excited astonishment, which however soon gave way to delight; and the
                    opera was performed in all the principal cities of Italy with rapturous
                    applause. The Italians were transported with a style at once so novel and
                    chaste, so masculine and energetic. When the <hi rend="italic">Oτfeo</hi>
                    afterwards came to be translated into French, Rousseau was so much charmed with
                    it that he did not miss a single representation; and it is in allusion to this
                    circumstance that he says, “If so much exalted pleasure can be enjoyed in the
                    space of two hours, it serves to convince us that life is really good for
                    something.”</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1774 Gluck came to Paris, and after studying with great
                    assiduity and careful examination the characteristics of the French language, he
                    composed his famous operas of <hi rend="italic">Iphigénie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >en Aulide</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Alceste,</hi> which were received with
                    a degree of enthusiasm unparalleled in the annals of music. By these successes
                    Gluck came to be regarded as the national musician of France. The congeniality
                    of his style with the standard favourites Lulli and Rameau called forth general
                    admiration. “The almost universal cry at Paris,” says Burney, “was now that he
                    had recovered the dramatic music of the ancient Greeks; that there was no other
                    worth hearing; that he was the only musician in Europe who knew how to express
                    the passions. These and other encomiums preparatory to his apotheosis, were
                    uttered and published in the journals and newspapers of Paris, accompanied with
                    constant and contemptuous censures of Italian music, when Piccini arrived. This
                    admirable composer, the delight and pride of Naples, as Gluck was of Vienna, had
                    no sooner erected his standard in France, than all the friends of Italian music,
                    of Rousseau’s doctrines, and of the plan, if not the language, of Metastasio’s
                    dramas, enlisted in his service. A furious war broke out; all Paris was on the
                        <hi rend="italic">qui vive.</hi> No door was opened to a visitor, without
                    this question being asked, previously to his admission, “Monsieur, estes vous
                    Picciniste ou Gluckiste ?” But these disputes were obviously futile as regarded
                    the merits of GÎuck and Piccini; for the genius and particular styles of these
                    great composers were so essentially different, that to praise the one was by no
                    means to detract from the powers of the other.</p>
                <p part="N">Gluck composed in 1774 his opera of <hi rend="italic">Amide,</hi> which
                    was followed by <hi rend="italic">Iphigénie</hi><hi rend="italic">en
                        Tauride,</hi> and some others; and after having completely revolutionized
                    the music of France, he returned to Vienna, where he remained until his death in
                    the year 1787.</p>
                <p part="N">Gluck has been well called the Michel Angelo of m⅛ sic. He was the
                    originator of a school which has opened up great and various sources of
                    enjoyment to taste, and mightily influenced the character of the whole art. His
                    genius was of the highest order. His invention was un-r equalled, particularly
                    in dramatic painting and theatrical effect. Some critics complain that he is
                    defective in song; but an intimate acquaintance with his works disproves the
                    assertion; and we have the emphatic declaration of Rousseau, “que le chant lui
                    sortait par les pores.” It is true that we cannot perhaps cull from his
                    compositions such melodious flowers as luxuriate in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >chef-ďoeuvres</hi> of Cimarosa, Mozart, and Rossini, and which gratify the
                    sense frequently as much when detached, as when blended in their original
                    wreath. The melodies of Gluck will not, with a few exceptions, stand the test of
                    such a partition. They are essentially musical phrases which belong to a great
                    and expanded work of imagination. They are the links of a chain, the component
                    elements of a comprehensive design, which must be judged of relatively, and with
                    reference to combination.</p>
                <p part="N">Thus it is that, when we criticise Gluck, we should not examine his
                    operas in detail. We must consider them as we would a noble edifice, in the
                    aggregate of its beauty. The same spirit that actuates us in reading the epics
                    of Virgil and Tasso should exercise its dominion when we listen to the music of
                    Gluck. His aim was rather to satisfy the mind than to flatter the ear; his music
                    appears only to impart energy or softness to the declamation, as the different
                    situations of the several characters require; and such is the effect of his
                    operas when properly performed, that many persons who hear them become so deeply
                    interested, that they cannot for an instant withhold their eyes from the stage,
                    and are kept in perpetual anxiety till the <hi rend="italic">denouement</hi> of
                    the drama; so fervently does he appeal to the sympathies of mankind, and gratify
                    the sweetest yearnings of our nature.</p>
                <p part="N">Whilst we admire the perfect symmetry and almost indefinable beauty of
                    the operas of Gluck, we are equally charmed with the amazing fertility of his
                    inventive powers. His airs are invariably original; he never copies himself. If
                    his melodies do not always catch the ear, it is because we do not take them in
                    connection with the passion or sentiment they are meant to express. Tried by
                    that test, we find them exquisitely appropriate. In recitative Gluck is
                    universally allowed to be greatest among the great. In this department he is
                    still the model which the best masters copy, and nothing can surpass his
                    movements for sublimity, boldness, and sustained beauty. The chorusses in his
                    operas are full of animation and imposing effect. His judicious employment of
                    orchestral accompaniments, and the striking effects which he thereby produced,
                    was a new feature in music; and much as this has since been studied, nothing can
                    better assure us of his superlative genius, than the fact, that up to this day,
                    he stands highest in that essential branch of operatic composition, which in-,
                    deed it may almost be said he created.</p>
                <p part="N">Whatever may be the opinion of some persons in regard-to the general
                    effect of the music of Gluck, all are agreed, in assigning to him the palm of
                    superiority in his treat-, ment of classical subjects, and depicting scenes of
                    deep, and overpowering grief. “He is,” says an anonymous author, “the only
                    master capable of grappling with a classical subject; he could give us, better
                    than any, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521650?mode=fullsize"

                    unjust flight.</p>
                <p part="N">No lovers, tyrannically separated for ever, have the despair of his.”
                    “It is,” says a writer in the <hi rend="italic">Harmonioon,</hi> “in scenes of
                    great distress, in which the human heart is rent by complicated misery, or in
                    situations where it is torn by the tempestuous fury of unbridled passions, that
                    Gluck, transported beyond the bounds of ordinary genius, shows such energy and
                    colouring of passion, as to become at once poet, painter, and musician. It may
                    be that his expression of passion is sometimes too strong for common hearers;
                    but</p>

                <p part="N">Qui sont faux pour l’oreiUe, mais sont vrais pour le coeur."</p>
                <p part="N">The operas of Gluck, much to the discredit of modern taste, are seldom
                    heard in France or England; but in Germany they are frequently performed; and in
                    Berlin, when any of his great operas are given, the theatres are crowded to
                    excess. The Germans indeed regard Gluck as the greatest of all dramatic
                    composers. The style of his airs is studied, and great attention bestowed on
                    their effect; and there is a warmth and an intensity displayed by the performers
                    in taking the recitative, and an energy in their action, which nothing but such
                    music as Gluck’s could inspire.</p>
                <p part="N">Gluck is described as having been of a frank and open character,
                    although his temper was hasty and choleric. He was very rigid in exacting from
                    performers the utmost purity and correctness of execution. (z. z.)</p>
