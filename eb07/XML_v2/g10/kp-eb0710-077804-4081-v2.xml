                    called by the inhabitants Graubundten. It has been composed out of three
                    confederacies, called the League of God’s House, the League of the Ten
                    Bailiwicks, and the Grey League. These, with some other small portions, had long
                    continued independent states, until 1798, when, after invasion by the French,
                    they were formally united into one state, and admitted as such into the Swiss
                    confederation. It is one of the largest of the cantons, being about 3010 square
                    miles in extent. It is bounded by Glarus, St Gall, and Austria, on the ęast by
                    the Tyrol, on the south by Austrian Italy and the canton Ticino, and on the west
                    by Uri. It is a most picturesque country. The Alps reach the height of 11,000
                    feet, with a line of perpetual snow of from 8200 to 8400 feet. There are said to
                    be within the canton 240 glaciers and 56 waterfalls. The valleys are strikingly
                    beautiful, and in them both the Rhine and the Inn have their sources. There are
                    five of these greater valleys, distinguished as the Hither Rhine, the Farther
                    Rhine, Engadine, the Albula, and the Brettegau, and nearly 150 smaller valleys
                    are connected with them, each with its peculiar features. The chief products are
                    those of the dairy, which are exchanged for corn, of which only half as much is
                    raised as the consumption requires. The chief trade is by the passes of the Alps
                    with Milan. The inhabitants are about 83,000, of whom 40,000 speak a
                    lingua-franca, the old .Romana rustica; about 30,000 speak German, and 13,000
                    Italian. The Roman Catholic church has 33,000 adherents, with six ministers and
                    eighty-six parish churches. The Protestants are 50,000, of the Helvetic
                    confession, and have six colleges, with 132 parish churches; but the pastors are
                    so poor that they are often compelled to have recourse to manual labour or trade
                    to support themselves. The government is a pure democracy. The three divisions,
                    as in old times, are still adhered to, and deputies, twenty-one from each
                    portion, meet, and all have separate presidents, and are assisted by councils
                    annually elected. The contingent of men furnished by the cantons to the Swiss
                    confederacy is 1600, and of money 12,000 francs. The annual revenue was, in
                    1831, L∙21,590, and the expenditure L.20,100. The public debt is now nearly
                    extinguished. Chur is the capital of the whole, as well as of <pb break="no"
