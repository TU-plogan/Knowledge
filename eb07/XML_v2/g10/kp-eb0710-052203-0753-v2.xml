                    a Protestant dissenting minister of the Baptist denomination, was the son of
                    Edward and Elizabeth Gill, and was born at Kettering in Northamptonshire, on the
                    23d November 1697. At a very early period of life his father, who was a deacon
                    of the Baptist church at Kettering, discovered in him an uncommon capacity for
                    learning; and his ability for literary pursuits afterwards appeared by the rapid
                    progress he had made <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520766?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0710-0766-0523"/>to whatever became the object of his study. He
                    was sent in a grammar-school in the neighbourhood, where he soon surpassed those
                    boys who were much his seniors in age and also as pupils. He continued till he
                    arrived at his eleventh year at this school, where he read most of the Latin
                    classics, and likewise made considerable proficiency in the Greek language.</p>
                <p part="N">He left the grammar-school, however, early in life. This was occasioned
                    by the imperious conduct of his master, who insisted that the children of
                    dissenting parents should, with other scholars who belonged to the
                    establishment, attend him to church on week days during the performance of
                    divine service. The dissenters considered this requisition as a stretch of power
                    to which his engagements with them gave him no claim; and as it was virtually
                    making conformity a test by which his pupils were to expect the benefits of
                    tuition, they resented his conduct, and the children of those parents who were
                    in affluent circumstances were removed to seminaries where the same advantages
                    might be obtained without being subject to the impositions of clerical bigotry.
                    But as the parents of Mr Gill had it not in their power to confer upon him the
                    same privilege, the same steps could not be taken to facilitate his advancement
                    in learning. In order to pave the way, however, for the completion of his
                    studies, efforts were made by several ministers, of different denominations, to
                    get him upon one or other of the funds in London. For this purpose specimens of
                    his progress in the different branches of literature were transmitted to the
                    metropolis; but in answer to these applications it was objected that he was too
                    young, and that should he continue, as it might be expected he would, to make
                    such rapid advances in his studies, he would pass through the common course
                    before he would be capable of taking care of himself, or of being employed in
                    any public service. But these formidable objections were of no weight with our
                    young scholar, whose love of learning was unconquerable. Insuperable
                    difficulties, it is true, obstructed the way in which literary eminence is
                    usually acquired; but these difficulties could neither reprėss his ardent desire
                    of knowledge, nor damp the zeal and application with which he had devoted
                    himself to his studies. For though his time was daily allotted to the business
                    of his father, yet he had so far improved the hours of leisure as to be able,
                    before he arrived at his nineteenth year, to read all the Greek and Latin
                    authors that fell in his way. He studied logic, rhetoric, moral and natural
                    philosophy; and learned the Hebrew language so as to read it with ease, without
                    any other assistance than Buxtorf’s grammar and lexicon.</p>
                <p part="N">Neither the pursuit of learning, however, nor the other necessary
                    avocations incumbent on Mr Gill, could eradicate those religious impressions
                    which he had received in early life. On the 1st of November 1716, he made a
                    public profession of his faith before the Baptist church at Kettering, and was
                    baptized the same day by Mr Thomas Wallis. Of this church Mr Gill had not been
                    long a member before he was called to the work of the ministry; soon after
                    which, he removed to Higham-Ferrers, with a view to pursue his studies under the
                    direction of Mr Davis; but his stay at the latter place was interrupted by an
                    invitation from London in 1719, t <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> preach to the
                    Baptist church in Horβlydown, over which he was the same year, being the
                    twenty-second of his age, ordained pastor; and this office he held upwards of
                    fifty-one years.</p>
                <p part="N">Mr Gill had not been long in London, before rabbinical learning, of
                    which he had before acquired considerable knowledge, became an object of
                    pursuit. To faciliate his progress through the intricacies of this labyrinth, he
                    contracted an acquaintance with one of the most learned of the Jewish rabbin. He
                    read the Targums, the Talmud, the Rabbot, their ancient commentaries, the book
                    Zohar, and whatever else of this kind he was able to procure. Of the oriental
                    languages he made himself a complete master; in short, there was no branch of
                    knowledge that could either enlarge or enrich biblical learning, which, however
                    difficult, was not attempted and attained by him; and it may be truly asserted,
                    that in this line he had but few equals, and that the annals of literature do
                    not exhibit many by whom he was excelled.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1748, Mr Gil) published a commentary on the New Testament, in three
                    volumes folio. The immense reading and learning discoverable in this arduous
                    work attracted the attention of the Marischal College and University of
                    Aberdeen, and procured for him the degree of Doctor in Divinity. He died at
                    Camberwell, on the 14th of October 1771, in the seventy-fourth year of his
                    age.</p>
                <p part="N">His works are, A Commentary on the Old and New Testament, in nine
                    volumes folio; A Body of Divinity, in three volumes quarto; The Cause of God and
                    Truth, four volumes octavo; A Treatise concerning the Prophecies of the Old
                    Testament respecting the Messiah; A Dissertation on the antiquity of the Hebrew
                    Language, Letters, Vowel Points, and Accents; and Sermons on the Canticles,
                    folio; besides a great number of sermons and controversial pieces.</p>
