                    one of the most celebrated philosophers France has produced, was bom at
                    Chantersier, near Digne in Provence, in 1592. When a child, he took particular
                    delight in gazing at the moon and stars as often as they appeared in clear
                    unclouded weather; and the pleasure he thus experienced frequently drew him into
                    bye places, so that his parents had often to seek him, not without many anxious
                    fears and apprehensions. They therefore put him to school at Digne, where, in a
                    short time, he made such extraordinary progress in learning, that some persons
                    who had seen specimens of his genius resolved to have him removed to Aix, in
                    order to study philosophy under Fesaye, a learned Carmelite friar. This proposal
                    was so disagreeable to his father, who intended to breed him up in his own way
                    to country business, that he would consent to it only upon condition that his
                    son should return home in two years at farthest. Accordingly, young Gassendi, at
                    the end of the appointed time, repaired to Chantersier; but he had not been long
                    there when he was invited to become professor of rhetoric at Digne, before he
                    was quite sixteen years of age; and he had been engaged in that office but three
                    years, when his master Fesaye dying, he was made professor in his stead at Aix.
                    When he had been a few years at the latter place, he composed his Paradoxical
                    Exercitations against Aristotle, which having fallen into the hands of Nicholas
                    Peiresc, that great patron of learning joined with Joseph Walter, prior of
                    Valette, in promoting the author; and the latter having entered into holy
                    orders, was first made canon of the church of Digne and doctor of divinity, and
                    then advanced to the wardenship or rectory of that church. Gassendi’s fondness
                    for astronomy grew with his years; and as his reputation daily increased, he was
                    in the year 1645 appointed royal professor of mathematics at Paris. This
                    professorship being chiefly designed for astronomy, our author read lectures on
                    that science to a crowded audience. However, he did not hold this place long;
                    for a dangerous cough, accompanied by inflammation of the lungs, obliged him in
                    the year 1647 to return to Digne for the benefit of his native air.</p>
                <p part="N">Antiquarian, historian, biographer, natural philosopher, naturalist,
                    astronomer, ‘geometrician, anatomist, preacher, metaphysician, hellenist,
                    dialectician, an erudite scholar, an able critic, and withal an elegant writer,
                    Gassendi ranged through nearly the whole circle of the sciences and arts, at a
                    period when the sciences and arts had been but recently revived; and throughout
                    his laborious and ingenious researches he constantly manifested an excellent
                    spirit. He was the first disciple of Bacon in France, the friend of Galileo and
                    Kepler, the opponent of Descartes, and the precursor of Newton and of Locke. For
                    an eloquent and comprehensive view of his labours and researches as a
                    metaphysician, the reader is referred to the first Dissertation, prefixed to the
                    present work.</p>
