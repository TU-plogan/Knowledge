                        George</hi></label>, public lecturer on botany and physic at Tubingen,
                    member of the Royal Society of Göttingen, and also of the Academy of Sciences at
                    Stockholm, was born on the 12th of August 1709, at Tubingen, where his father
                    was an apothecary. Such was his diligence whilst at school, that he was
                    qualified to attend the academical lectures at the age of fourteen, and was
                    created doctor of medicine when only nineteen. About this time he paid a visit
                    to the metropolis of the Russian empire, that he might have the pleasure of
                    seeing some of his former teachers; and there he became acquainted with
                    Blumentrost, director of the academy, who introduced him to the meetings of the
                    members, and procured for him a pension. At Petersburg he was so much esteemed,
                    that when he intimated a wish, in 1729, to return to Tubingen, he was honoured
                    with a place amongst the regular members of the academy, and chosen professor of
                    chemistry and natural history in the year 1731. In order to carry into execution
                    a plan which had been formed by Peter the Great, for exploring a passage to
                    China and Japan along the coast of the Russian empire, Gmelin was selected,
                    along with two others, as properly qualified for that undertaking, which had
                    also for its object to ascertain the boundaries of Siberia. The department of
                    natural history was assigned to him; and he had with him and his companions, six
                    students, two draftsmen, two hunters, two miners, four land-surveyors, and
                    twelve soldiers, with a sergeant and drummer. They began their journey on the
                    19th of August 1733; and in 1736 Steller and a painter joined their society, to
                    assist Gmelin in his arduous labours. By exploring Kamtschatka, they hoped to
                    accomplish their mission in a satisfactory manner, for which purpose Steller
                    proceeded to this place, whilst the rest of the party continued their travels
                    through Siberia. In February 1743 Gmelin returned to Petersburg in safety, after
                    a dangerous journey which lasted nine years and a half, but proved of the utmost
                    importance to various branches of science. He resumed the offices which he had
                    filled before; and having paid a visit, in 1747, to his native country, he was
                    chosen professor, whilst absent, in the room of Bachmeister. But in May 1755, he
                    was seized with a violent fever, which put a period to his valuable life, in the
                    forty-fifth year of his age. He was undoubtedly one of the most eminent
                    botanists of the eighteenth century, and has rendered his name immortal by his

                    boundaries between Europe and Asia, which every geographer has adopted since his
                    day. Through all his works the traces of great modesty, a sacred regard to
                    truth, and the most extensive knowledge of nature, are remarkably
                    conspicuous.</p>

                        Theophilus,</hi> was born at Tubingen on the 23d of June 1745. After having
                    taken the degree of doctor in medicine at the age of nineteen, he went to finish
                    his studies at Leyden, where a conformity of tastes for natural history united
                    him with Pallas. Finding himself involved in difficulties, he entertained the
                    idea of embarking as surgeon on board of a vessel bound for the East Indies; but
                    in the mean time, whilst waiting for assistance from his family, he established
                    himself in the little town of Brill. The vicinity of the sea, aud some
                    excursions which he made by water in the neighbourhood, afforded him an
                    opportunity of collecting many marine plants, and examining with attention the
                    sea-weeds, and suggested to him the idea of writing their history. He next
                    visited Belgium, and then proceeded to Paris, where he was well received by
                    Adanson, who inspired him with something of his own aversion to the system of
                    Linnaeus. After a short stay in his native country, he was, in 1766, called to
                    St Petersburg, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521663?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0710-1663-0592"/>there to profess botany. Catherine II.,
                    faithful to the plan executed by several of her predecessors, of causing learned
                    men to travel in different parts of the Russian empire, ordered a new expedition
                    of the same description to be undertaken. Gmelin obtained permission to join
                    this expedition; and after having had the honour of being presented to the
                    empress, he set out in the month of June 1768, visited the Valdaï Mountains,
                    passed the winter at Woronetz, and descended the Don as far as Tscherkask. Here
                    the frightful picture which was drawn of the journey, by the steppes, and along
                    the frontier to the mouth of the Terek in the Caspian Sea, induced him to
                    renounce his first project; and he returned by the ordinary route, as far as
                    Zaritzin, in order to proceed to Astrakan by the Volga. In the years 1770 and
                    1771 he visited different harbours of the Caspian, and examined with peculiar
                    attention those parts of the Persian provinces bordering upon that sea, of which
                    he has given a circumstantial account in his travels. Actuated by a zeal for
                    extending his observations, he attempted to pass through the western provinces
                    of Persia, which are in a state of perpetual disturbance, and infested by
                    numerous banditti. In this expedition he, in April 1772, quitted £nzelli, a
                    small trading place in Ghilan, upon the southern shore of the Caspian; but, on
                    account of many difficulties and dangers, did not, until the 2d of December
                    1773, reach Sallian, a town situated at the mouth of the river Koor. He thence
                    proceeded to Baku and Kuba, in the province of Shirvan, where he met with a
                    friendly reception from Ali Feth Khan, the sovereign of that district. But after
                    he had been joined by twenty Uralian Cossacks, and when he was only four days
                    journey from the Russian fortress of Kislar, on the Terek, he and his companions
                    were, on the 5th of February 1774, arrested by order of Usméi Khan, a petty
                    Tartar prince, through whose territories he was obliged to pass. Usméi urged as
                    a pretence for this arrest, that thirty years before several families had
                    escaped from his dominions, and had found an asylum in the Russian territories;
                    adding, that Gmelin should not be released until these families were restored.
                    The professor was removed from prison to prison; and at length, wearied out with
                    continued persecutions, he expired, on the 27th of June, at Achmet-Kent, a
                    village of the Caucasus. His death was occasioned partly by vexation for the
                    loss of several papers and collections, and partly by disorders contracted from
                    the fatigues of his long journey. Some of his papers had been sent to Kislar
                    during his imprisonment, and the others were not without great difficulty
                    rescued from the hands of the barbarian who had detained him in captivity. The
                    arrangement of these papers, which form the fourth volume of his travels, was at
                    first consigned to the care of Guldenstaedt, but upon his death was transferred
                    to the learned Pallas. The works of Gmelin are, 1. Historia Fucorum iconibus
