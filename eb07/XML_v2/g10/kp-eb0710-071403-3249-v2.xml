                    author of Observations on the Bills of Mortality, and the founder of Political
                    Arithmetic, was born at London on the 24tlι of April 1620, bred up in all the
                    strictness of puritan principles, and, being designed for trade, received no
                    more education than was barely necessary for that purpose. At an early age he
                    was put as apprentice to a haberdasher in the city, whose trade he afterwards
                    followed; and when he entered into business on his own account, he gained the
                    esteem and confidence of his fellowcitizens, passed with reputation through all
                    the offices of his ward, and was first captain and then major of the trained
                    bands. But his genius at length prompted him to seek distinctions of a higher
                    kind, and enabled him to overcome all the disadvantages of a confined education,
                    to form a new and noble design, and to execute it with a degree of ability equal
                    to the sagacity he had displayed in forming it. It is not known at what precise
                    time he first began to collect and digest the Bills of Mortality; but it
                    appears, from his own statement, that he had directed his attention to the
                    subject several years before he had any design of publishing the discoveries
                    which rewarded his researches. His book, entitled Observations on the Bills of
                    Mortality, was <pb break="no" facs="nls:193523262?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0710-3262-0715"/> published in 1661, 4to, and met with so
                    favourable a reception that a second edition was called for the succeeding year,
                    and others followed. Immediately after its publication, Louis XIV., by a royal
                    ordonnance, provided that a more exact register of births and burials should be
                    kept in Paris; and Charles II. conceived so high an opinion of his abilities,
                    that, at the institution of the Royal Society, he recommended Graunt to the
                    choice of the members, with this Additional charge, that if they found any more
                    such tradesmen, they should be sure to admit them. Graunt appears to have
                    changed his religion, and become Roman Catholic, some time before his death,
                    which took place on the 18th of April 1674. He left his papers in charge to Sir
                    William Petty, who had all along befriended him, and who took care to adjust and
                    insert them in a fifth edition of his work published in 1676, 8vo. The
                    observations of Graunt may be considered as having formed the elements of that
                    useful science afterwards styled Political Arithmetic, which, therefore, he is
                    entitled to the honour of having founded; and whatever merit may be ascribed to
                    Sir William Petty, Mr Daniel King, Dr Davenant, and others, there can be no
                    doubt that the Observations on the Bills of Mortality served as the model, if
                    not as the basis, of all their investigations. <hi rend="smallcaps"
