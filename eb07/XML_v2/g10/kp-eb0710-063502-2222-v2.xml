                    antiquity, may not be uninteresting.</p>
                <p part="N">1. Athenaeus tells us, in his Deipnosophist (lib. ii.), that in the
                    famous regulation made by Amphictyon, king of Athens, respecting the use of
                    wine, both in sacrifices and at home, he required that the name of Jupiter the
                    Sus-tainer should be decently and reverently pronounced. The same writer (lib.
                    iv. p. 149) quotes Hermeias, an author extant in his time, who mentions a people
                    in Egypt, inhabitants of the city of Naucratis, whose custom it was on certain
                    occasions, after they had placed themselves in the usual posture of eating at
                    table, to rise again and kneel, upon which the priest or precentor of the
                    solemnity began to chant a grace, according to a stated form amongst them; and
                    when that was over, they joined in the meal in a solemn sacrificial manner.
                    Heliodorus has a passage to the same purpose in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >AEthiopica,</hi> where it is stated that it was the custom of the Egyptian
                    philosophers to pour out libations and utter ejaculations before they sat down
                    to meals. Porphyry (in his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Abstinentia,</hi> lib. iv. p. 408) gives a high character of the Samnean
                    gymnosophists in Egypt for the strictness of their lives; and, as one
                    circumstance in their favour, he observes, that at the sounding of a bell before
                    their meals, which consisted only of rice, bread, fruits, and herbs, they went
                    to prayers; that when these were ended, and not before, the bell again sounded,
                    and they sat down to eat. This religious usage or rite was also common amongst
                    the ancient Greeks, and, if Clement of Alexandria rightly informs us, it was
                    derived from yet older times. He mentions that this people, when they met
                    together to refresh themselves with the juice of the grape, sung a piece of
                    music, in imitation of the Hebrew psalms, which they called a scho)ion. Livy
                    (lib. xxxix.) likewise speaks of it as a settled custom amongst the old Romans,
                    that they offered sacrifice and prayer to the gods at their meals and
                    compotations. But one of the fullest testimonies to our purpose is given by
                    Quintilian <hi rend="italic">(Declam.</hi> SOI): <hi rend="italic">Adisti
                        mensam,</hi> says he, <hi rend="italic">ad quam cum venire</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">capimus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Deos</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >invocamus.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Trigautius, in his elegant and instructive narrative of the expedition
                    of the Jesuit missionaries into China (book i. p. 69), gives this account of the
                    people of that country in the particular now under consideration. “Before they
                    place themselves for partaking of an entertainment, the person who makes it sets
                    a vessel, either of gold, or silver, or marble, or some such valuable material,
                    in a charger full of wine, which he holds with both his hands, and then makes
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi> low bow to the person of chief quality or character
                    at the table. Then from the hall or dining-room he goes into the porch or entry,
                    where he again makes a very low bow, and turning his face to the south, pours
                    out this wine upon the ground as a thankful oblation to the Lord of heaven.
                    After this, repeating his reverential obeisance, he returns into the hall.” The
                    Turks also pray for a blessing on their meat; and many more instances might be
                    produced of infidels who constantly observe the same custom in some way or
                    other.</p>
                <p part="N">2. The fact, therefore, with respect to the heathen world being thus
                    evident, we proceed to notice the sentiments and conduct of the Jews in this
                    particular. Their historian Josephus, giving a detail of the rites and customs
                    of the Essenes, who were confessedly the strictest and most pious professors of
                    the Jewish religion, has this remarkable passage: “The priest,” says he, “prays
                    for a blessing before they presume to take any nourishment; and it is looked
                    upon as a great sin to take or taste before.” Then follows the thanksgiving
                    after meat. “When the meal,” he proceeds, “is over, the priest prays again; and
                    the company with him bless and praise God as their preserver, and the giver of
                    their life and nourishment.”</p>
                <p part="N">But Philo, in his book <hi rend="italic">De Vita</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Contemplativa,</hi> gives an account of a body of men and women stricter
                    than even the Ľssenes. He distinguishes them by no particular name, though his
                    relation is minute and circumstantial; namely, that on certain special
                    occasions, before “they took their meals, they placed themselves in a proper
                    decent order, when, lifting up their hands and eyes to heaven, they prayed to
                    God that he would be pleased to be propitious to them in the use of those his
                    good creatures.”</p>
                <p part="N">It appears, from the Hebrew ritual, that the Jews had their hymns and
                    psalms of thanksgiving, not only after eating their passover, but on a variety
                    of other occasions, at and after meals, and even between their several courses
                    and dishes; as when the best of their wine was brought upon the table, or their
                    aromatic confections, or the fruits of the garden, or the like. Upon the day of
                    the passover was sung the 114th psalm, “When Israel went out of Egypt.”</p>
                <p part="N">Aristaeus has also a passage on the same subject. “Moses,” says he,
                    “commands that when the Jews are going to eat or drink, the company should
                    immediately join in sacrifice or prayer.” It is doubtful where Rabbi Eleazar
                    found this sentence, and its genuineness has been controverted. But supposing it
                    not to be found <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">scriptis,</hi> it is
                    sufficient to know that the Jews constantly practised this custom, upon the
                    foundation of an ancient tradition and general usage. That the prophet Daniel
                    gave thanks before meat is evident from the Apocryphal book concerning Bel and
                    the Dragon, where (verses 38, 39) we find that “Daniel said, Thou hast
                    remembered me, 0 God, neither hast thou forsaken them who seek thee and love
                    thee; so Daniel arose, and did eat.” Of this text Prudentia takes notice in
                    Cathemirin (hymn iv.):</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Hi» sumpti» Danicli» excitavit</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >In</hi><hi rend="italic">catum faciem, ciboque forti»,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Amen</hi><hi rend="italic">reddidit, allelujah dixit.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">It may be observed by the way, that the poet is a little mistaken in
                    making the prophet give thanks after meat; for, according to the text, he did so
                    before.</p>
