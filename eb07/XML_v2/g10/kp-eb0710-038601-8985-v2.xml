                        Francis</hi></label>, a physician eminent for his chemical and botanical
                    knowledge, was bom at Paris on the 13th of February 1672, where his father kept
                    an apothecary’s shop, and had been several times in the magistracy. He received
                    a liberal education; and, whilst prosecuting the study of medicine, he had
                    conferences at his father’s house with Cassini, Duveraey, Homberg, and other men
                    of distinguished eminence. At Montpellier he attended the lectures of the ablest
                    professors of physic, and afterwards visited the south of France, carefully
                    viewing every object deserving of his attention. He accompanied Count de Tallard
                    to England in 1698, where he became acquainted with the leading men of science,
                    and was admitted a member of the Royal Society. He next went into Holland, and
                    in 1700 he accompanied the Abbé de Louvois in a tour to Italy. On his return, he
                    became a licentiate in 1702, and, in two years after, he was created doctor of
                    medicine. One of his theses was <hi rend="italic">A vermibus hominum ortus
                        interitus</hi><hi rend="italic">î</hi> which was translated into French

                    ladies of high rank, by whom it was deemed interesting.</p>
                <p part="N">Geoffroy did not hastily commence the practice of medicine, continuing
                    the prosecution of his studies in retirement for some years. He appeared nowise
                    anxious to push himself forward, although his knowledge made him often be
                    consulted by several gentlemen of the faculty; and he felt so concerned for the
                    recovery of his patients, that it imparted to him an air of melancholy, which at
                    first alarmed them, till they became acquainted with the cause. In 1709, he was
                    appointed by the king professor of physic to the Royal College, vacant by the
                    death of the celebrated Tournefort, and began with lectures on Materia Medica;
                    but in 1712, Fagon resigned to him the chemical chair, and on both subjects
                    Geoffroy lectured with unwearied assiduity. He was twice chosen as dean by the
                    faculty of Paris, and from the year 1699 he filled a place in the Royal Academy
                    of Sciences. Anxious to discharge his various functions with credit, his health
                    at last sunk under fatigue, and he died upon the 5th of January 1731. He is
                    known to the chemical world by his table of affinities, which is far superior to
                    any that had appeared before his time. His greatest work was his <hi

                    which was published in an unfinished state, after his death, Paris, 1741, in 3
                    vols. 8vo. This learned and laborious author enriched the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mémoires</hi> of the Academy of Sciences with different articles, the
                    princiţial of which were, 1. Table des Différents Rapports observes en Chimie
