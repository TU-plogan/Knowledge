                <p part="N"><label type="entry">GLORY</label>, renown or celebrity. The love of
                    renown, or the desire of fame and reputation, appears to be one of the principal
                    springs of human action. Glory, therefore, is not to be contemned, as some of
                    the ancient philosophers affected to teach; but it imports us to regulate our
                    pursuit of it by the dictates of reason; and if the public approbation follow
                    not, the search must be abandoned. We ought to have our judgment well instructed
                    as to what actions are truly glorious, and to remember, that in every important
                    enterprise, as Seneca observes, <hi rend="italic">Recte facti fecisse
                        merces</hi><hi rend="italic">est,</hi><hi rend="italic">officii fructus
                        ipsum officium est,</hi> the reward of a thing well done is to have done it,
                    the fruit of a good office is the office itself. Those who by other methods
                    contrive to place their names in many mouths, show that they rather seek after a
                    great reputation than a good one, and their reward is oftener infamy than
                    fame.</p>
                <p part="N">Men generally, and indeed almost instinctively, affix glory to such
                    actions only as have been produced by an innate desire of public good; and this
                    may be measured by that degree of influence which the thing done has upon the
                    common happiness. If the actions of the hero conduct soonest to glory and with
                    the greatest splendour, and if the victorious general is so great after a signal
                    engagement, it is because the service he has performed is considered as a
                    service done for all; and because we think without reflecting, that he has saved
                    our habitations, our wealth, our children, and every thing that attaches us to
                    life. If the man of science, who in his study has discovered and calculated the
                    motions of the heavenly bodies, who in his alembics has detected some of the
                    secrets of nature, or who has exhibited to mankind a new art, rises with less
                    noise to fame, it is because the service which he renders is more widely
                    diffused, and is often of less service to the present than to succeeding
                    generations.</p>
                <p part="N">The consequences of these two advantages are, therefore, as opposite as
                    the causes are different; and whilst the benefits secured by the warrior appear
                    to exert no more influence, and his glory is obscured, that of a celebrated
                    writer or inventor still increases, and becomes more and more enlarged. His
                    works every day recall his name to the remembrance of those who read them, and
                    thus still add to his celebrity and fame.</p>
                <p part="N">This posthumous fame indeed has been decried by some writers, and, in
                    particular, the author of the <hi rend="italic">Religion of Nature
                        delineated</hi> has treated it as highly irrational and absurd. “In
                    reality,” says he, “the man is not known ever the more to posterity, because his
                    name is transmitted to them; he doth not live, because his name does. When it is
                    said Julius Caesar subdued Gaul, conquered Pompey, &amp;c., it is the same thing
                    as to say, the conqueror of Pompey was Julius Caesar; that is, Caesar and the
                    conqueror of Pompey is the same thing; Caesar is as much known by one
                    designation as by the other. The amount then is only this, that the conqueror of
                    Pompey conquered Pompey; or somebody conquered Pompey; or rather, since Pompey
                    is as little known now as Caesar, somebody conquered somebody. Such a poor
                    business is this boasted immortality, and such is the thing called glory among
                    us! To discerning men this fame is mere air, and what they despise, if not
                    shun.”</p>
                <p part="N">But surely it were to judge a little too curiously to view matters thus.
                    For, as is observed by the judicious author of Fitzosborne’s Letters, although
                    fame with posterity should be, in the strict analysis of it, no other than what
                    is here described, a mere uninteresting proposition, amounting to nothing more
                    than that somebody acted meritoriously; yet it would not necessarily follow,
                    that true philosophy should banish the desire of it from the human breast; since
                    this passion may be, as most certainly it is, wisely implanted in our species,
                    notwithstanding the corresponding object should in reality be very different
                    from what it appears in imagination. Do not many of our most refined and even
                    contemplative pleasures owe their existence to our mistakes? It is but extending
                    some of our senses to a higher degree of acuteness than we now possess them, to
                    make the fairest views of nature, or the noblest productions of art, appear
                    horrid and deformed. To see things as they truly are in themselves, would not
                    always, perhaps, be of advantage to us in the intellectual world, any more than
                    in the natural. But, after all, who shall certainly assure us that the pleasure
                    of virtuous fame dies with its possessor, and reaches not to another scene of
                    existence? There is nothing, it should seem, either absurd or unphilosophical
                        <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521572?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0710-1572-0585"/>in supposing it possible, at least, that the
                    praises of the good and the judicious, the sweetest music to an honest ear in
                    this world, may be echoed back to the mansions of the next; that the poet’s
                    description of Fame may be literally true, and that though she walks upon earth,
                    she may yet lift her head into heaven.</p>
                <p part="N">To be convinced of the great advantage of cherishing this high regard to
                    posterity, this noble desire of an after life in the breath of others, one need
                    only look back upon the history of the ancient Greeks and Romans. For what other
                    principle was it which produced that exalted strain of virtue in those days,
                    which may well serve, in so many respects, as a model to these? Was it not the
                        <hi rend="italic">consentiens</hi><hi rend="italic">laus bonorum,</hi> the
                        <hi rend="italic">incorrupta</hi><hi rend="italic">vox bene</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">judicantium,</hi> as Cicero calls it, “the concurrent
                    approbation of the good, the uncorrupted applause of the wise,” that animated
                    their most generous pursuits?</p>
                <p part="N">In short, can it be reasonable to extinguish a passion which nature has
                    universally lighted up in the human breast, and which we constantly find burning
                    with greatest strength and brightness in the noblest and best constituted
                    natures? Accordingly, revelation is so far from endeavouring to eradicate the
                    seed which nature has thus deeply implanted, that it rather seems, on the
                    contrary, to cherish and forward the growth thereof. To be “exalted with
                    honour,” and to be “had in everlasting remembrance,” are among the number of
                    those encouragements which the Jewish dispensation offered to the virtuous; and
                    the person from whom the sacred Author of the Christian system received his
                    birth, is herself represented as rejoicing that “all generations would call her
                    blessed.”</p>
