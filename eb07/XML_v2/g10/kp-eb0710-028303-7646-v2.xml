                        rend="smallcaps">Sulpicius,</hi> a Roman emperor, who was born B. c. 3 and
                    died <hi rend="smallcaps">a. ð.</hi> 69. He was descended from a family which
                    had first risen to notice towards the latter years of the republic. His father,
                    who was of consular rank, had some pretensions to be considered as an orator; he
                    married Mummia, the grand-niece of L. Mummius, the conqueror of Corinth, and by
                    her he had the emperor Galba. Of his youthful years we can give no account,
                    excepting that he must have evinced early proofs of great abilities. Augustus is
                    said to have foretold that he would be one of his successors on the imperial
                    throne. We find him raised to the highest dignities of the state before he had
                    reached the age fixed by law, consul <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 33, and
                    then appointed by Caligula to the command of the troops in Gaul. On the deatlι
                    of that emperor <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. d.</hi> 40), he was strongly urged by
                    his friends to put in his claim for the vacant throne; but he seems to have
                    preferred the pleasures of retirement to the anxieties of a court. Claudius was
                    so charmed witlι the moderation of his conduct, that he admitted him to his
                    intimate friendship, and made him proconsul of Africa as a mark of his
                    particular favour. Here he remained for two years, carrying the strictness of
                    military discipline into all the civil arrangements of the province. On his
                    return to Rome he retired to the privacy of the country, and took no part in
                    public affairs till the middle of the reign of Nero. He was then invited by that
                    emperor to assume the command of Hispania Tarraconensis, and it may be readily
                    imagined that he did not venture to refuse such a request. This province he
                    continued to govern for eight years; at first he distinguished himself by the
                    severity with which he punished even venial faults, though the example given by
                    Suetonius is a curious proof of the state of moral feeling in that age. The
                    author expresses his surprise at the punishment of crucifixion, which Galba
                    inflicted on a guardian who had poisoned his ward. Latterly, however, he changed
                    his policy, and apparently passed his life in indolent repose, that he might
                    give no cause of complaint to the suspicious Nero. That despot, however, thought
                    him too powerful a pasha to be allowed to live, and, like the sultans of later
                    times, sent an order for his death. His friends at Rome informed him of his
                    impending fate, and he had therefore no other alternative than to declare his
                    independence, proclaiming himself lieutenant of the senate and of the Roman
                    people. But as soon as he was informed of the death of Nero, he assumed the
                    title of emperor, being the first person not descended from the family of the
                    Caesars who reached that high dignity.</p>
                <p part="N">His previous life, and the habits which he had acquired, were little
                    suited to the scene of corruption and debasement into which he now emerged. All
                    ranks at Rome had become, by a long course of unrestrained license, so
                    completely demoralized, that they could ill brook the sternness of an old
                    military disciplinarian. He does not appear to have possessed any of the mental
                    qualities of a statesman, nor was his previous education of a character likely
                    to fit him for the position in which he now found himself placed. The affairs of
                    the empire seem to have been chiefly directed by three favourites of very
                    dissimilar characters; T. Vinius, his lieutenant in Spain, a man of unbounded
                    avarice; Laco, prefect of the praetorian band, equally distiπ-guisheđ<pb

                    for his indolence and arrogance; and the freedman Icelus, who had all the
                    follies of a foolish upstart. Every act of theirs was ascribed to the emperor,
                    and all classes were equally dissatisfied with their proceedings. The soldiers
                    were refused their usual largesses, and were deeply mortified by the reply of
                    the emperor, <hi rend="italic">Legere se militem, non</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >emere,</hi><hi rend="italic">consuesse.</hi> The soldiers in Upper Germany
                    openly refused to take the oath of allegiance to Galba; and at Rome Otho headed
                    a conspiracy, which was embraced by too large a body not to prove successful
                    against a man who stood nearly alone in Rome. He was assassinated in the seventh
                    month of his reign, and in the seventy-third year of his age, <hi rend="italic"
