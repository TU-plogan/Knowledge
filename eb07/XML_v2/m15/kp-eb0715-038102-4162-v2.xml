                <p part="N"><label type="entry">MONARCHY</label>, a large state governed by one man,
                    or astate where the supreme power is lodged in the hands of a single person. The
                    word comes from the Greek, <hi rend="italic">μovαgχης</hi>, one who governs
                    alone; formed of <hi rend="italic">μονος, solus,</hi> alone, and <hi
                        rend="italic">ά</hi><hi rend="italic">ζχη, imperium,</hi> government. Of the
                    three forms of government, democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy, the last is the
                    most powerful, all the sinews of government being knit together, and united in
                    the hand of the prince; but then there is imminent danger of his employing that
                    strength to improvident or oppressive purposes. As a democracy is best
                    calculated to direct the end of a law, and an aristocracy to invent the means by
                    which that end shall be obtained, a monarchy is most fitted for carrying those
                    means into execution.</p>
                <p part="N">The most ancient monarchy was that of the Assyrians, which was founded
                    soon after the Deluge. We usually reckon four grand or universal monarchies; the
                    Assyrian, Persian, Grecian, and Roman; though St Augustin makes them but two,
                    namely, those of Babylon and Rome. Belus is placed at the head of the series of
                    Assyrian kings who reigned at Babylon, and is by profane authors esteemed the
                    founder of that empire; by some he was considered as the same person whom the
                    Scriptures call Nimrod. The principal Assyrian kings after Belus were Ninus, who
                    built Nineveh, and removed the seat of empire to it; Semiramis, who, disguising
                    her sex, took possession of the kingdom instead of her son, and was killed and
                    succeeded by her son Ninyas; and Sardanapalus, the last of the Assyrian
                    monarchs, and more effeminate than any woman. After his death the Assyrian
                    empire was divided into three separate kingdoms, viz. the Median,’ Assyrian, and
                    Babylonian. The first king of the Median kingdom was Arbaces; and this kingdom
                    lasted till the time of Astyages, who was subdued and divested of his dominions
                    by Cyrus.</p>
                <p part="N">- In the time of Cyrus there arose a new and second monarchy called the
                    Persian, which lasted upwards of 200 years from Cyrus, whose reign began in the
                    year of the world 3468, to Darius Codomannus, who was conquered by Alexander,
                    and the empire transferred to the Greeks in 3674. The first monarch was Cyrus,
                    founder of the empire; the second, Cambyses the son of Cyrus; the third,
                    Smerdis; the fourth, Darius the son of Hystaspis, who reigned 521 years before
                    Christ; the fifth, Xerxes, who reigned 485 years before Christ; the sixth,
                    Artaxerxes Longimanus, who reigned 464 years before Christ; the seventh, Xerxes
                    the second; the eighth, Ochus or Darius, called Nothus, who reigned 424 years
                    before Christ; the ninth, Artaxerxes Mnemon, 405 years before Christ; the tenth,
                    Artaxerxes Ochus, 359 years before Christ; the eleventh, Arses, 338 years before
                    Christ; the twelfth, Darius Codomannus, who was defeated by Alexander the Great,
                    and deprived of his kingdom and life about 331 years before Christ. After his
                    death, the dominion of Persia was transferred to the Greeks.</p>
                <p part="N">The third monarchy was the Grecian. As Alexander, when he died, did not
                    declare who should succeed him, there started up as many kings as there were
                    commanders. At first they governed the provinces, which were divided amongst
                    them, under the title of viceroys; but when the family of Alexander the Great
                    became extinct, they assumed the style and title of kings. Hence, in process of
                    time, the whole empire of Alexander produced four distinct kingdoms. The first
                    was the Macedonian, the kings of which, after Alexander, were Antipater,
                    Cassander, Demetrius Poliorcetes, Seleucus Nicanor, Meleager, Antigonus Doson,
                    Philip, and Perseus, under whom the Macedonian kingdom was reduced to the form
                    of a Roman province. The second was the Asiatic kingdom, which, upon the death
                    of Alexander, fell to Antigonus, comprehending the country now called Anatolia,
                    together with some other regions beyond Mount Taurus. From this kingdom
                    proceeded two lesser ones; that of Pergamus, whose last king, Attalus, appointed
                    the Roman people to be his heir; and Pontus, reduced by the Romans into the form
                    of a province, when they had subdued the last king, Mithridates. The third was
                    the Syrian, of whose twenty-two kings the most celebrated were, Seleucus
                    Nicanor, founder of the kingdom, Antiochus Deus, Antiochus the Great, Antiochus
                    Epiphanes, and Tigranes, who was conquered by the Romans under Pompey, when
                    Syria was reduced into the form of a Roman province. The fourth was the
                    Egyptian, which was formed by the Greeks in Egypt, and flourished near 240
                    years, under twelve kings, the principal of whom were, Ptolemy Lagus, its
                    founder; Ptolemy Philadelphus, founder of the Alexandrian library; and Queen
                    Cleopatra, who was overcome by Augustus, in consequence of which Egypt was added
                    to the dominion of the Romans.</p>
                <p part="N">The fourth monarchy was the Roman, which lasted 244 years, from the
                    building of the city until the time when the royal power was abrogated. The
                    kings of Rome were Romulus, its founder, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Aneus
                    Martius, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius, and Tarquinius Superbus, who was
                    banished, and with whom terminated the regal power.</p>
                <p part="N">There seems in reality to be no necessity for making the Medes, the
                    Persians, and the Greeks, succeed to the whole power of the Assyrians, in order
                    to multiply the number of the monarchies. It was the same empire still; and the
                    several changes which happened in it did not constitute different monarchies.
                    Thus the Roman empire was <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824175?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0715-4175-0382"/>successively governed by princes of different
                    nations, yet without any new monarchy being thereby formed. Rome, therefore, may
                    be said to have immediately succeeded to Babylon in the empire of the world.</p>

                    time of Cromwell, and expected Christ’s sudden appearance upon earth to
                    establish a new kingdom; in consequence of which illusion, they aimed at the
                    subversion of all human government.</p>
