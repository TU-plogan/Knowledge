                    later period it contained the eight following principalities: 1. Hy Breoghan,
                    now the county of Waterford; 2. Osragii, afterwards Ossory, and now forming
                    parts of the Queen’s County and of Tipperary; 3. Oir-Mumhan, East Munster, now
                    Ormond, comprehending the baronies of Ormond and of Owney and Arra in Tipperary;
                    4. Tuath-Mumhan, Thomond, or North Munster, now the county of Clare; 5.
                    Aine-Cliach, or Eoganach Aine-Cliach, now Limerick; 6. Ciar or Cerrigia, now
                    Kerry; 7. Aoibh-Liathain, containing the northern part of the county of Cork;
                    and, 8. Corcaluighe, the southern part of the same county, and the ancient
                    kingdom of Cork. The principal toparchs or heads of septs in those divisions,
                    several of whom assumed the title of king, but acknowledged the supremacy of the
                    king of Munster, were the O’Briens, the Barrys, the M <hi rend="superscript">
                        f</hi> Arthys, and the O’Sullivans. After the arrival of the English, the
                    greater part of the province became the property of the Butlers, and of
                    different branches of the Fitzgerald family, amongst the latter of whom the Earl
                    of Desmond long ruled the whole of its southern portion with an authority almost
                    independent of that of the English crown. On the death of the last earl of that
                    name, and the subsequent confiscation of his immense estates by Elizabeth in
                    consequence of his rebellion, the greatest part of it was parcelled outamongst
                    English adventurers, amongst whom was the celebrated Sir Walter Raleigh. The
                    descendants of these adventurers, or “undertakers,” as they were styled in the
                    phraseology of those days, have, for the most part, melted away from observation
                    in a manner altogether unaccountable and surprising. The province is now divided
                    into the six counties of Clare, formerly included in Connaught, Cork, Kerry,
                    Limerick, Tipperary, and Waterford.</p>
                <p part="N">According to the ecclesiastical arrangements of Ireland, Munster
                    constituted the province of Cashel, consisting of the archbishopric of the same
                    name, with which were united the diocese of Emly; the bishopric of Limerick,
                    Ardfert, and Aghadoe; the bishopric of Waterford and Lismore; the bishopric of
                    Cork and Ross; the bishopric of Cloyne; and the bishopric of Killaloe and
                    Kilfenora. This arrangement has been lately altered by the legislature. The
                    archbishopric of Cashel is, on the demise of the present holder thereof, to he
                    reduced to the rank of a bishopric, subordinate to the archiépiscopal see of
                    Dublin, and the whole province is to be consolidated into four dioceses, in the
                    following manner: Cashel is to be holden with Emly, Waterford, and Lismore;
                    Cloyne with Cork and Ross; Killaloe with Kilfenora, and with these are also tobe
                    united the sees of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh, hjtherto forming part of the
                    archiépiscopal province of Tuam; and Limerick with Ardfert and Aghadoe, as
                    hitherto..</p>
                <p part="N">The northern parts of Munster are, generally speaking, level. Towards
                    the south and south-west the land rises into elevations of considerable height,
                    Macgillicuddy’s Reeks, in Kerry, being the highest mountain range in Ireland.
                    Garrantual, the most elevated of its peaks, is nearly 3500 feet above the level
                    of the sea. The mountains in the county of Cork stretch in the direction of east
                    and west. The lofty range of Slieve-Bloom forms the eastern boundary of the
                    province. The river Shannon passes through its northern part, separating the
                    county of Clare from those of Tipperary, Limerick, and Kerry. The Suir,
                    Blackwater, Lee, and Bandon, water the southern districts. The only lakes of
                    note are those of Killarney, in Kerry, which owe their celebrity much more to
                    the picturesque beauties of their scenery than to the extent of their surface.
                    The bays, creeks, headlands, and islands, which are numerous, and in most
                    instances worthy of special notice, have been already mentioned in the general
                    description of the island. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Ireland.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The climate, though moist from its exposure to the prevailing
                    south-western winds, which pass over itloaded with the humid exhalations of the
                    Atlantic, is peculiarly mild. The severity of winter is but slightly felt even
                    in its more elevated regions, whilst in its more level parts, along its southern
                    shores, the myrtle blooms richly and unsheltered; and the arbutus, indigenous in
                    Kerry, attains an unusual size. Such is the prevailing opinion of the genial
                    temperature of the atmosphere, that an attempt was lately made to introduce the
                    rearing of the silk-worm on a great scale, in the hope of establishing the silk
                    manufacture on a permanent basis in this part of Ireland, by having the raw
                    material at the mere price of its production; and though the experiment has
                    failed as to its main object, the growth of the mulberry trees, which were
                    planted in large numbers for the sustenance of the insect, has proved that they
                    were not fixed in an ungenial climate.</p>
                <p part="N">The soil throughout the level parts is peculiarly fertile, producing
                    abundantly rich crops of every kind of grain, and many species of fruits, which,
                    in other parts of the island, are capable of being ripened only by means of an
                    artificial atmosphere. The tract of land stretching across the counties of
                    Limerick and Tipperary, from Askeaton to the limits of Kilkenny, has long been
                    distinguished by the name of the Golden Vale, an appellation justly bestowed
                    upon it from its singular fertility. Even in the less favoured climate of the
                    elevated parts of Kerry, tillage has been carried upwards along the mountain
                    sides to heights unexampled elsewhere.</p>
                <p part="N">As to its geological relations, the northern parts of Munster are
                    included within the limits of the great plain of floetz limestone, which
                    constitutes the central formation of Ireland. The southern parts are mostly of
                    the sandstone and clay-slate formation; the former being more developed in the
                    mountains, the latter in the more level parts. Bog is abundant and very
                    generally distributed, although the province lies without the great central
                    band, which embraces most of the soil of this description. Coal is found in
                    large quantities in the interior; but its use is much limited by the rugged
                    character of the region within which it lies, and the consequent difficulty of
                    carriage. There are two fields of this mineral; one, the larger, in the centre
                    of Cork county; the other in Tipperary, where a branch of the great Leinster
                    coal-field stretches into the province. In both places the -mineral is of the
                    carbonaceous or stone-coal species, the slate glantz-coal of Werner. Several
                    mines of copper, lead, and iron, were worked with profit until stopped by the
                    failure of timber for fuel; notwithstanding which a few are still carried on
                    successfully. Mineral springs are numerous; that of Mallow, which is of the same
                    nature with the hot wells near Bristol, maintaining a high character for its
                    medical efficacy. Transparent crystals are frequently found in Kerry. Some caves
                    producing stalactites have been lately discovered in the county of Cork, and the
                    precipitous fissures in the cliffs upon the western and southern shores, where
                    the surface soil has been washed away by the workings of the ocean, present many
                    objects of great interest to the geologist.</p>
                <p part="N">The population ofMunsteramountedin 1821 to 1,935,612 souls, and in 1831
                    to 2,165,193. The peasantry are a large, athletic, and handsome race,
                    exhibiting, in their oval faces and dark hair, strong traces of similarity with
                    the Spaniards. Their occupation is chiefly agricultural. The raising of grain
                    and the pasturage of cattle, which are exported in great numbers from Cork,
                    Limerick, and Waterford, form their chief employment. The manufacture of frizes
                    and coarse woollens, as also of coarse linen cloth for domestic consumption, is
                    carried on very generally. Formerly the country round Carrick-on-Suir was the
                    seat of an extensive woollen trade.</p>
                <p part="N">The province contains several of the largest cities in Ireland: Cork,
                    the next in size and population to Dublin, containing a population of upwards of
                    100,000; Limerick, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826931?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0715-6931-0594"/>having 65,000; and Waterford, nearly 30,000.
                    Each of these is the seat of a good export trade, chiefly in provisions.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">. Münster,</hi> one of the governments into which
                    the Prussian province of Westphalia is divided. It is formed out θf. the,
                    ancient bishopric of that name, and several sovereignties which have been at
                    different times secularized or mediatized, viz. Salm-Ahaus, Salm-Bocholt,
                    Rheina-Wol-bech, Horstmar, Dulmen, Steinfurt, Anhalt-Dulmen, Ghemen, and Gronau.
                    It extends over 2228 square miles, is divided into ten circles, and comprehends
                    thirty-eight cities or walled places, fifteen market-towns, and 732 villages,
                    with 57,577 houses, inhabited by 382,540 individuals. It is for the most part a
                    poor and heathy district, excepting near the rivers. It produces barley-corn
                    equal to the consumption, but is very deficient in fuel.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Munster,</hi> a city, the capital of the Prussian
                    government of that name. It is situated on the river Aa, which, by means of a
                    canal, communicates with the Ems. It was formerly fortified; but its walls have
                    recently been converted into elegant promenades. It has a fine palace, and a
                    castle near it; and the cathedral is an ancient building, surrounded by rows of
                    trees. It contains six parish churches, one of which is Lutheran, the others
                    Catholic. It is the seat of a Catholic bishop, and of a college formerly
                    belonging to the Jesuits, for the education of Catholic priests. On the tower of
                    one of the churches are affixed the three iron cages in which Knipperdoling and
                    his companions, the leaders of the Anabaptists, were suspended, after their
                    revolutionary movements were suppressed, in 1535. The place is remarkable for
                    the peace of Westphalia, concluded at it, after many years of deliberation, in
                    1648. It now contains 1500 houses, and 18,260 inhabitants, exclusive of the
                    military. In the town-hall is a curious collection of ancient armour, and many
                    other antiquities. There are only some small manufactories of linen and woollen
                    goods; but there is considerable trade in the exchange of internal commodities,
                    especially in Rhine wine and wool, and there are several breweries. Long. 7. 31.
