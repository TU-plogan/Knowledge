                <p part="N">If a simple and easily applied system of monochromatic illumination,
                    that is, of illuminating objects with homogeneous light, which a prism, and
                    consequently a lens, is not capable of dispersing or refracting in different
                    directions, could be contrived, we should neveragain hearof compound achromatic
                    microscopes. We believe it will be admitted, that in Sir John Herschel’s doublet
                    of no aberration, the spherical aberration is more completely corrected than in
                    any double or even triple achromatic object-glass. Hence it follows, that in
                    homogeneous light such a doublet would be a better microscope than the compound
                    lens. But in the best system of achromatic compensation that can be executed,
                    the secondary spectrum still remains without a remedy; and hence the doublet of
                    no aberration, in which there can be no secondary colour in homogeneous light,
                    must be a superior instrument to the compound achromatic lens. Now, in
                    telescopes it is impossible, except in viewing the sun’s disc,<note

                            telescope should never be an achromatic one, but should consist of a
                            compound lens of no aberration, all the colours of the spectrum being

                    through the tube C, into a thin platina or metallic cup, in which it burns. A
                    strong heat is kept up by a spirit lamp L enclosed in a dark lanthorn, and when
                    the diluted alcohol is inflamed, it will burn with a fierce and powerful yellow
                    flame. If the flame should not be perfectly yellow, or rather of a <hi

                    proportion of salt thrown into the cup D will have the same effect as a farther
                    dilution of the alcohol. Sometimes a little blue light will be found mixed with
                    the yellow, but this may be easily absorbed by a piece of yellow glass placed on
                    any part of the microscope through which the rays pass. Although this light is
                    feeble compared with that of white flames, yet, by using larger lenses for
                    condensing it, it is quite easy to obtain a pencil sufficiently powerful for all
                    microscopic observations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p part="N">A stronger flame may be produced by using a gas lamp, or, what is still
                    better, a portable gas one containing compressed gas. This gas, when rushing out
                    in a full stream, explodes when burned with atmospheric air, emitting much heat,
                    and a faint bluish and reddish light. As the force of the issuing gas is
                    sufficient to blow out the flame, a contrivance for sustaining it becomes
                    necessary. The method which we contrived for this purpose is shown in the
                    annexed figure, where PQ is the main body of the lamp, MN the principal burner,

                <p part="N">When the few blue rays which sometimes mingle themselves with this
                    yellow light are absorbed, every part of the light will be found to have a

                    of the light.</p>

                    simplest and most easily applicable to microscopes, is that of absorption; and
                    the best rays to leave unabsorbed or insulated are the red. It requires some

                    combined with another plate of red glass, and placed beneath the object, all
                    these colours instantly disappear, and a perfection of vision is obtained, which
                    can be disturbed only by the very small portion of spherical aberration which
                    must exist in the sphere, and which an increased depth of the groove would
                    render almost insensible. Blue glasses, and green and yellow, as well as
                    coloured fluids, may be successfully used in narrowing the range of
                    refrangibility of the red space.</p>

                    in order to have a perfect apparatus, the <hi rend="italic">microscope should

                    in front of the object-glass of which is placed a fine large prism, for forming
                    the spectrum within the telescope. By this method, which we have put to the test
                    of experiment, microscopical observations can be carried on with an accuracy and
                    satisfaction which nothing can exceed. We enjoy the luxury of perfectly
                    monochromatic vision, which the most perfect achromatic compensation cannot
                    give; and while we have the spherical aberration corrected, we have no secondary
                    colours, and none of the imperfections of vision which must arise in
                    transmitting light through six or eight lenses of plate and flint glass.</p>

                    order, as they obstruct the progress of improvement among those who justly
                    admire Dr Goring’s ingenuity and knowledge in every thing which relates to the
                    microscope.</p>
                <p part="N">1. Dr Goring’s first objection to monochromatic illumination is, that it
                    is too weak, and must be about one seventh of the whole beam of light. This we
                    are not disposed to dispute; but Dr Goring is too well acquainted with the
                    resources of optical science, to forget that this monochromatic seventh of a
                    beam of light may be made <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> times more intense than
                    the whole beam. The objection, however, does not apply to the solar spectrum,
                    for one seventh of the sun’s light is too intense for any eye to bear.</p>
                <p part="N">2. The second objection of our author is, that the colours of the
                    spectrum, when separated by the prism, are actually separated into different
                    colours when they are refracted in oblique pencils by a microscope. If this
                    observation is correct, then we must denounce the prism that produced such a
                    spectrum as utterly useless. Dr Goring, however, conceives his observation and
                    his prism to be good, and endeavours to explain the result by referring to Sir
                    David Brewster’s analysis of the spectrum, in which it is shown that white light
                    exists at every point of it; but this white light, which has been rendered
                    visible by absorption, cannot be decomposed by refraction of any kind, as it
                    consists of red, yellow, and blue rays, of the same refrangibility. Such white
                    light is the light that is wanted for the microscope; and there can be little
                    doubt that absorptive media will yet be discovered to effect its insulation in
                    sufficient quantity for practical purposes.</p>
                <p part="N">3. Another objection to monochromatic light is, that it will not show
                    the real colours of microscopic bodies. This is true; but the object of the
                    microscope is not to find out colours, but structures. A common glass lens, with
                    common light, will let the observer have all that he wants of the colours of
                    objects; and when he has learned this, he will then gladly avail himself of
                    coloured light for more important purposes. We can truly say, that though we
                    have wrought with the microscope for thirty years, we do not at present
                    recollect a single case where we required to know any thing of the precise
                    colours of minute bodies. Notwithstanding this discussion, Dr Goring concludes
                    his chapter with the following observation, in which we entirely concur. “A
                    monochromatic light, therefore, being once obtained <hi rend="italic">in a
                        sufficient state of intensity for practical purposes,</hi> bids fair to
                    conduct us to the highest perfection of which aplanatic object-glasses and
                    magnifiers are susceptible.” It may be proper to add, that the best system of
                    compound achromatic object-glasses now in use would be freed of all their
                    secondary colours, by using monochromatic light; and they may be also greatly
                    improved by employing suitable coloured media to absorb what are called the
                    outstanding rays in an achromatic combination.</p>

                <p part="N">CHAP. VI.—ON THE PREPARATION OF THE OBJECT AND THE EYE FOR MICROSCOPICAL
                    OBSERVATIONS.</p>
                <p part="N">In using lenses of short focus, either singly or in doublets and
                    triplets, the object is so near the lens, and its thickness, even when very
                    small, forms’such a considerable part of its distance from the nearest
                    refracting surface, that any bend or want of flatness in the object completely
                    interferes with the distinct vision of its parts. When the object will bear
                    pressure, the best way is to lay above it a thin transparent film, with
                    perfectly parallel and polished surfaces, such as a splinter of New Holland
                    topaz, a thin plate of sulphate of lime, or a film of mica. If these plates are
                    a little less thick than the distance between the lens and the object, a little
                    bees-wax should be interposed between the" brass setting of the lens and the
                    plate, so that the lens in the act of adjustment would press the wax against the
                    plate, and the plate against the object, till distinct vision is obtained. The
                    object should be placed upon a deeply curved concave surface.</p>
                <p part="N">The proper flattening of the object, when it is tender, may be effected
                    by pressing a thick balsam above it, and allowing the lens to dip into the
                    balsam. If the surface of the lcns is flat, its magnifying power will suffer no
                    diminution.</p>
                <p part="N">When grooved spheres are used, such as the garnet one above mentioned,
                    the object requires to be very near its surface. It should therefore be placed
                    in a concave lens of glass, of a little greater radius than the sphere, and
                    pressed into the concave form by interposing a narrow strip of a thin film of
                    mica, and, if necessary, pieces of wax or India-rubber, as before; the pieces
                    filling up the space between the lens and the mica, so as not to interfere with
                    the part of the object under examination.</p>
                <p part="N">If a diminution of the magnifying power can be permitted, a fluid maybe
                    placed between the concave object-plates and the grooved sphere, and the
                    chromatic aberrati on greatly reduced. By the interposition of a fluid a grooved
                    diamond sphere may be used; for though its focus for parallel rays falls within
                    the sphere when the refractions are made from air and into air, yet when the
                    first refraction is made from a suitable fluid, the focus will fall without the
                    sphere.</p>
                <p part="N">When the object is put into the best possible condition for observation,
                    and the illuminator applied in the best possible manner, the observer will have
                    every advantage in his researches; but still the structure which he seeks to
                    dcvelope may escape his eager research. Under these circumstances, he must
                    perform his part of the observation in the best possible manner.</p>
                <p part="N">Unless particular arrangements are made by the observer for his own
                    comfort, there is no bodily fatigue to be compared with that of the use of the
                    microscope. The eye, the mind, and the whole frame, are on the stretch. The
                    observer must therefore first try if his own eye is in a right state for
                    observation. The fluid which lubricates the cornea, which must be considered as
                    a lens, and as part of the microscope, is sometimes in such a viscid state, that
                    when the eyelids roll over the cornea by that beautiful provision of nature by
                    which it is kept smooth and clean, the lubricating fluid, which is pushed into a
                    ridge between the eyelids, does not quickly recover a convex surface. This state
                    of the cornea is incompatible with delicate microscopic observations, and its
                    existence may be ascertained by viewing the expanded image of a luminous point
                    held close to the eye, and, after shutting the eyelids and again opening them
                    slowly, observing if the luminous disc recovers its uniform luminosity quickly
                    or slowly. If the luminous line produced by the fluid accumulated between the
                    eyelids continues to be visible, and the general surface mottled and spotted,
                    the lubricating secretion should be excited by exposing the eye to the vapour of
                    hartshorn, raised by pouring a few drops on the surface of boiling water. The
                    secretion will now flow copiously, the cornea will be swept clean by the purer
                    and less viscid fluid, and the vision of the observer greatly improved. But this
                    moveable fluid surface of the cornea generates another imperfection of vision,
                    which has already been referred to. This fluid, when undisturbed by the eyelids,
                    descends by the influence of gravity in vertical lines, and the minute ridges
                    thus formed obliterate and render indistinct all horizontal lines seen by the
                    eye, but have a tendency rather to improve the vision of vertical lines. In
                    proof of this, we may state the unquestionable fact, that if we take a striped
                    pattern of any fabric, and bend part of it into a horizontal direction, while
                    the rest remains vertical, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> the vertical
                    part will always appear the most distinct. Hence, in viewing lined objects, when
                    the position of the observer’s head is either vertical or oblique, the lines of
                    the lined object should be always placed parallel to the direction of the
                    descending fluid. If the axis of the lenses is vertical, and the eye looks
                    downwards, the lubricating fluid will collect irregularly at the apex of the
                    cornea, and injure vision. If the axis of the lenses is horizontal, and the
                    observer’s head in its natural position, the fluid will descend in vertical
                    lines; but if the observer lies on his back and looks into the microscope
                    upwards, a position, we admit, not favourable for research, the fluid will flow
                    equally in all directions from the apex to the margin of the cornea, and leave a
                    clear centre well fitted for distinct vision. We may here notice the beautiful
                    contrivance, not mentioned by natural theologians, that the effect of vertical
                    descent of the lubricating fluid is counteracted by the eyelids opening
                    horizontally, and consequently effacing the tendency of the fluid to form
                    vertical currents. Had the eyelids opened vertically, the vertical ridges would
                    have been increased, and vision greatly impaired.</p>

                    (the only part of the eye over which we have any direct command) for accurate
                    vision, the general state of the health, or any casual irregularity of diet,
                    will be sometimes found to affect the state of the organ, and unfit it for nice
                    observation. To remedy'this defect of vision, we must refer the patient to the
                    simplest prescriptions of his physician.</p>
                <p part="N">When these precautions have been taken, the observer must protect his
                    eye from all extraneous light; and the most effectual way of doing this is to
                    use the snow spectacles of the Greenlanders, which are cut out of wood so as to
                    exclude all light whatever, except what enters through a circular aperture the

                <p part="N">The last requisite for accurate microscopical observation is steadiness

                    first is easily attained. The second may be accomplished by the observer resting
                    his doubled arms upon a stool or frame nearly the height of the eye-glass of the
                    microscope, but unconnected with it, while his chin rests either upon his arms

                    but in all these cases, while we improve and give a finer definition to the

                <p part="N">PERFORMANCE OF MICROSCOPES.</p>
                <p part="N">This class of objects, and their application to the microscope, we owe
                    to Dr Goring; and to their introduction we must ascribe much of the rapid
                    improvement which this instrument has undergone. The finest test-objects are the
                    scales of butterflies and moths, which were suggested to Dr Goring by the
                    following passage in Leewenhoeck. “If we examine the wings of this creature (the
                    silk-worm moth) by the microscope, we shall find them covered with an incredible
                    number of feathers (scales), of such various forms, that if an hundred or more
                    of them were to be seen lying together, each would appear of a different shape.
                    To show more clearly this wonderful object, I caused eight feathers to be
                    delineated, for I do not remember that I ever saw them of so curious a make in
                    any flying insect.</p>
                <p part="N">“Although the microscope, by which these feathers were drawn,
                    represented objects very distinctly, <hi rend="italic">the limner could not
                        through it see the ribs or streaks in each feather until I pointed them out
                        to him</hi>; therefore, I put into his hands a microscope which magnified
                    objects almost as much as that by which the silk worm’s thread was drawn,
                    desiring him to give the figure of that feather which through it he could see
                    the most distinct.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p
                            part="N">Select Works, p. 63.</p></note></p>
                <p part="N">From this passage, Dr Goring naturally inferred, that there were some
                    peculiar properties in the lines on the feathers and scales of insects, which
                    rendered them more difficult to be discovered than other microscopic objects;
                    and hence he discovered their properties as <hi rend="italic">test</hi> or proof
                    objects for trying the penetrating powers of microscopes. Mr Pritchard regards
                    the <hi rend="italic">penetrating</hi> power of a microscope as dependent on its
                    angle of aperture, and its <hi rend="italic">defining</hi> power as in the
                    inverse ratio of the quantity of chromatic and spherical aberration. When the
                    angle of aperture was less than a certain quantity, he found that the lined
                    structure of the scales could not be rendered visible, however perfect the
                    instrument was. ’The following is his list of test objects, arranged in relation

                <p part="N">In some of the preceding figures of the lined proof objects the reader
                    will perceive diagonal or oblique lines, as in fig. 9, 10, different from the
                    longitudinal ones seen in fig. 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. These lines are reckoned more
                    difficult to be seen than the longitudinal ones; and Dr Goring has mentioned
                    those on the scales of the white-cabbage butterfly as a difficult test object.
                    Mr Potter, who has seen these diagonal lines, mentions also his having observed
                    them on the scales of the wing of the small housemoth. As the nature of these
                    oblique lines is far from being understood, and as their real existence is in
                    our opinion questionable, we shall lay before our readers Mr Pritchard’s
                    observations on those observed in the scales of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Podura</hi><hi rend="italic">plumbea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pieris
                        brassica.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">“In the foregoing account,” says he, “of the different scales from the
                    wings and bodies of insects, the design has been to give their <hi rend="italic"
                        >appearances</hi> under microscopes or engiscopes without in the least
                    determining their actual structure. When it is considered that these lines are
                    less than the twenty thousandth of an inch distant, it must be allowed there is
                    some difficulty in accurately determining their construction. The Morpho
                    menelaus and Lepisma saccharina are of sufficient size to distinctly perceive
                    they are composed of two delicate tissues with longitudinal cords (probably
                    tabular) disposed between them; but in the two delicate ones, the subject of
                    these remarks, we perceive other systems of }ines disposed obliquely; and as
                    they are extremely delicate, it becomes à question whether they actually exist,
                    or whether they are appearances produced under certain modifications of the
                    illumination. As there is only one set shown at a time, and I have never been
                    able to see them in the decided way of the longitudinal lines, I have been
                    induced to consider them as appearances only, and not real lines. To determine
                    this point, it became necessary to ascertain the cause that would produce such
                    an effect; and it immediately occurred to me that these oblique lines were
                    occasioned by the disposition and pressure of the superambient scales, in the
                    same manner as the watering or wavy appearance communicated to-corded silks and
                    moreens by the pressure of two pieces passed between rollers.<note

                    many interesting observations on lined objects, of which it is necessary to give
                    some account. In order to explain the effects of aperture on lined objects, he
                    has represented in the <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> circles shown in fig. 23,
                    Plate CCCLXII. the different appearances of a portion of the scale of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Mοr-plιο menelaus,</hi> shown in fig. 1, produced by
                    increasing the aperture. He used a triple achromatic object-glass nine tenths of
                    an inch focus, and half an inch in aperture, with a negative eye-piece of one
                    fourth of an inch.</p>
                <p part="N">No. 1. shows the appearance of the scale when the aperture was one tenth

                    apertures of different sizes in a reflecting microscope. With a well-figured

                    into dots and points, but to appear in what he supposes to be their proper
                    character. “The two sets of diagonal lines,” he remarks, “will be shown with a
                    force and effect which will leave no doubt of their existence in the mind of a
                    candid observer; the various lines, the longitudinal, the cross striae, and the

                    have had some misgivings on the subject. In speaking of the lined tests, he
                    says, “<hi rend="italic">There is an inexplicable mystery about them, for if
                        their lines are in reality pι oduced on the same principle as those of
                        micrometers, why are they not as easily seen</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi> No
                    penetrating power or large angular aperture is requisite to bring out the lines
                    on a micrometer, though divided nearly as finely as ordinary tests, to the
                    extent perhaps of 10,000 in an inch.” These observations are just and
                    philosophical, and we would add only a single observation in support of them,
                    that Dr Wollaston made platina wires the 18,000th of an inch in diameter, and
                    saw them distinctly; and we venture to say, that in no instrument whatever would
                    such lines appear either dotted or ragged.</p>
                <p part="N">Such was the state of this subject when these lined objects were
                    examined by Sir David Brewster, both in reference to their action upon light
                    when examined by the naked eye, and when placed under the microscope as test
                    objects. Having been occupied for several years in a series of analogous
                    observations on the lines which apparently separate the component fibres of the
                    crystalline lenses of animals, he was familiar with the class of optical
                    illusions which interfere with the accurate development of such structures.</p>
                <p part="N">Upon exposing the finest lined objects to a bright light, and excluding
                    as much as possible all other extraneous rays, he saw distinctly the fringes of
                    colour produced by inte.rference; and on measuring the angular distances of the
                    first red fringe from the light, he found that the distance of the lines, or
                    rather the diameter of one black line and half the bright space between the
                    lines, varied from the 10,000th to the 22,000th of an inch. Hence, if we take
                    the black lines and their intervals to be equal, the diameter of each will vary
                    from about the 13,000th to the 29,000th of an inch.</p>
                <p part="N">Although these apparent lines give colours by interference, exactly like
                    the analogous lines in the laminae of the crystalline lens, yet neither of them
                    are <hi rend="italic">real lines,</hi> as decided upon by Dr Goring. With small
                    apertures the lines in the crystalline lens appear <hi rend="italic">dotty,
                        interrupted, uneven,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ragged,</hi> and exhibit, in
                    short, all the general phenomena of the lines on proof objects; but with a good
                    microscope and ajarge aperture, we discover the true secret of all these
                    appearances. They are not lines, but a succession of teeth arranged in lines;
                    and from the great number of lines forming the sides of the teeth, they appear
                    dark. Each fibre, in short, has teeth on each side of it,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">See Phil. Trans.
                        1830.</p></note> and the teeth of one fibre lock into the spaces between the
                    teeth of the adjacent fibres. When we trace these fibres towards the pole to
                    which they converge, they become smaller and smaller, the teeth diminishing in
                    the same proportion, so that they become as difficult, and finally more
                    difficult to resolve than the lines in the proof objects.</p>
                <p part="N">After a laborious examination of the lined tests, and the use of every
                    optical resource which he could command, Sir David Brewster has found that the
                    mysterious lines on these test objects are only apparent lines, being composed
                    of a succession of interlocking teeth, by which the fibres to which they are
                    attached form that delicate film which composes the scale of a moth. We now see
                    the source of all the perplexities which have beset this class of observations.
                    We understand why such lines are not seen so distinctly as the real lines on
                    micrometers, and the dots and the raggedness are all explained. In the lenses of
                    quadrupeds the teeth of the fibres are not round like those of fishes, but are
                    often sharp pointed and extremely short, like a jagged line, or a line with <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193819937?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9937-0056"/>
                    points projecting from it. In like manner, the separation of the teeth is much
                    more distinct in some of the lined objects than in others. See fig. 24, in which
                    we have given a rude representation of the lines.</p>
                <p part="N">With regard to the diagonal or oblique lines, which have been such a
                    source of perplexity to microscopical observers, we have little hesitation in
                    pronouncing <hi rend="italic">those which we have seen</hi> to be optical
                    illusions from the accidental <hi rend="italic">alignement</hi> of the sides of
                    the teeth in different grooves, when similarly illuminated by oblique rays. When
                    the scales are immersed in diluted sulphuric acid, we have never seen the
                    diagonal lines. When the sulphuric acid is too strong, the scales curl up, and
                    often in this state exhibit the lines very beautifully. We have observed
                    diagonal lines singularly developed in the laminae of the crystalline, and
                    clearly arising from the interference of the rays acted upon by the lines on one
                    side of the lamina, with the rays acted upon by the lines on the other side, and
                    therefore we have been the more confirmed in our opinion. As we have not had the
                    advantage, however, of using any of the fine reflecting microscopes with which
                    Dr Goring observed the oblique lines so distinctly brought out, it is still with
                    considerable diffidence that we place our conclusions in opposition to so direct
                    and distinct an observation, made by such skilful and experienced observers as
                    he and Mr Pritchard.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p
                            part="N">Mr Pritchard informs us that the diagonal lines or cross striae

                            the ordinary lines, Mr Pritchard remarks, that these lines or
                            “markings,” with his best instruments, “appear detached like short hairs
                            or spines covering the delicate tissue of the scale. This latter
                            appearance is correct, the prominent portions of the lines which have
                            escaped the pressure of those of the surrounding scales being in a plane
                            above the other portions of the lines.” This opinion of the structure of
                            the lines, published in 1835, is not repeated in the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Micrographia,</hi> published in 1837, where Dr Goring decides that

                <p part="N">With the view of arriving at a just decision respecting the nature of
                    the lines, Sir David Brewster endeavoured to ascertain the disposition of the
                    colouring matter on the scales. Owing to the great brightness of the lines on
                    the black scales, especially near their root, he was at first disposed to infer
                    that, at least in these scales, the colouring matter was arranged along the
                    black lines, the particles being more readily detained in their places by the
                    edges of the teeth. He has found, however, that in other scales the colouring
                    matter lies also along the bright lines; and it is only when this colouring
                    matter is removed, or its effect masqued, by removing the refraction at its
                    surface by immersion in a fluid, that the lines of proof objects are developed
                    with perfect distinctness.</p>

                    two surfaces of each wing. He supposes, of course, all the scales to be the same
                    in size and structure, and he finds that there are</p>

                <p part="N">In the preceding chapter we have already described some of the most
                    interesting objects for microscopical observation. Every department of nature is
                    full of objects, from the examination of which the most important discoveries
                    may be expected; bnt though the zealous observer can never be at any loss for
                    subjects of research, it is desirable to know what has been done by our
                    predecessors, and what trains of inquiry are most likely to prove of general
                    interest. There are subjects of microscopic inquiry which are closely connected
                    with the most interesting parts of physiology; and even geology itself,
                    conversant with the grandest subjects of research, has recently been illustrated
                    by the aid of the microscope.</p>

                <p part="N">The weight of a cubic inch of the polishing-slate is 270 grains. There
                    are, therefore, 187 millions of these animals in a single grain, or the

                    these singular microscopic objects, as seen by Ehrenberg.</p>
                <p part="N">Another example of the value of microscopical observations may be drawn
                    from the discovery of the teeth of the fibres, which compose the crystalline
                    lenses of almost all animals. The crystalline lens is composed of innumerable
                    fibres of nearly the same length, each of which tapers from its middle to its
                    two extremities, where it comes to the sharpest point. The sides of each of
                    these fibres are furnished with teeth like those of a watch-wheel, and the teeth
                    of the one lock into those of the adjacent ones, as shown in fig. 28, Plate
                    CCCLXH. When the power is small, or the microscope not good, or the laminae too
                    thick and not nicely detached, each row of interlocking teeth appears as a dark
                    line, sometimes as sharp as a black line drawn upon paper with a pen. Sometimes
                    the lines appear rough and ragged, and as the fibres become less and less in
                    approaching the poles, the black lines are as difficult to resolve into teeth as
                    the lines on test-objects already described. The following measures, taken by
                    Sir David Brewster, will show what a wonderful structure in the eye has been
                    thus disclosed to us by the microscope. The calculations refer to the lens∙of a

                <p part="N">There is another class of objects of extreme interest, which Mr
                    Pritchard has omitted to notice, and the development of which called forth all
                    the resources of optical knowledge and practical experience with the microscope.
                    These objects are the microscopic cavities in minerals, containing two fluids
                    unknown to the chemist, groups of crystals, floating balls, and exhibiting
                    actual chemical operations going on in these minute laboratories when exposed to
                    changes of temperature. These various phenomena have been described and
                    represented in drawings, in two papers by Sir David Brewster, published in the
                    Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In some of the precious stones,
                    particularly in diamond, garnet, &amp;c. these cavities are perfect spheres;
                    but, owing to the great refractive power of the gem, they appear completely
                    black and opaque, though the microscope descries a small spot of light in their
                    centre, which is the pencil of light which they refract. These spherical
                    cavities, and this central spot, are the finest objects for examining the
                    aberration of lenses and specula, and are infinitely preferable to the reflected
                    patches of light from small spherules of quicksilver. Dr Goring has observed
                    spherical cavities or air-bubbles in fluids, and, with his usual ingenuity,
                    recognised their utility for indicating the effects of aberration. Those which
                    we have used in the gems are, however, permanent instruments of much greater
                    utility, not only from our being able to use the same bright spot with all
                    instruments and on all occasions, but from the dark ring round the bright spot
                    being incomparably greater in the gems than in fluids.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">The ratio between the diameter
                            of the dark sphere and of the small luminous spot gives a measure of the
                            refractive power of the solid or fluid.</p></note> Representations of
                    some of the cavities in fluids are given in Plate CCCLXIL fig. 29, 30, 31. Fig.
                    29 shows the cavities containing the two new fluids, which will not mix, though
                    in the same cavity. The little circle is the bubble either of gas or of vacuity.
                    The fluid round it is a highly evaporable fluid, and the fluid in the angles and
                    ends of long cavities is a thick and unevaporable fluid, which indurates when
                    exposed to the air. Figs. 29 and 30 are beautifully formed cavities in
                    topaz.</p>
