                        >Antony,</hi> a learned Italian scholar and antiquary, was born at Vignola,
                    in the duchy of Modena, on the 21st of October 1672. He received his elementary
                    education at the college of Modena, where he signalized himself by his
                    application, and the rapidity of his progress in the ancient languages and in
                    literature. He then entered the university, where he passed through the ordinary
                    curriculum, applying himself with equal ardour to the study of philosophy,
                    jurisprudence, and theology. Father Bacchini, the learned librarian of the Duke
                    of Modena, inspired him with a taste for historical researches, and taught him
                    to read manuscripts; and so much did he profit by his advantages, that, at the
                    age of twenty, he was considered as a prodigy of talent and erudition. In 1694
                    he was called to Milan by Count Carlo Borromeo, who had appointed him a keeper
                    of the Ambrosian Library. But before quitting Modena, he wished to take his
                    degree of doctor <hi rend="italic">in utroquxjure</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and the theses which he maintained on this occasion were universally applauded.
                    Having established himself at Milan, and taken sacred orders, Muratori entered
                    upon a course of study and research calculated to justify the hopes which his
                    talents had inspired; and having made a selection from the numerous manuscripts
                    intrusted to his care, he published them with dissertations, intended to throw
                    light upon various disputed points in archaeology. The reputation he thus
                    acquired was great, and the Duke of Modena, regretting that he had parted with a
                    man who seemed destined to attain such distinction, offered him, as an
                    inducement to return, the situation of conservator of the public archives of the
                    duchy, together with that of keeper of his library, vacant by the resignation of
                    Father Bacchini. Muratori returned in 1700 to Modena, which he never quitted,
                    except to visit the public collections of the principal cities of Italy. In 1734
                    Apostolo Zeno offered him the chair of belles-lettres in the university of
                    Padua; but Muratori declined accepting a situation which would have withdrawn
                    him from his favourite pursuits. The publication of a number of valuable tracts
                    on the history of Italy during the middle ages, besides various learned
                    dissertations, added every year to his growing reputation; and this
                    indefatigable writer also found leisure to cultivate polite literature, nay,
                    even to take part in the theological discussions which then occupied so much of
                    the public attention. Indeed all the journals and all the literary collections
                    of the time were enriched with some of his productions, the constant aim of
                    which was utility. The complaisance with which he communicated the result of his
                    researches had put him in communication with the most distinguished scholars of
                    Italy, France, and Germany, who had recourse to him on all subjects of
                    difficulty; literary societies vied with one another in sending him diplomas of
                    admission; and many who had attained eminence in different departments of
                    literature paid him the homage of inscribing to him their works. But, amidst all
                    these flattering distinctions, he was sometimes the object of injurious
                    criticisms, and on one occasion found himself called upon to repel unjust
                    accusations. A rumour having been circulated that Benedict XIV. had discovered,
                    in the works of Muratori, propositions contrary to the truths of religion, and
                    that the supreme pontiff had specified these in a brief directed to the
                    inquisitor-general of Spain, the learned librarian, confident of his innocence,
                    addressed a letter to the pope full of respect and submission, in which he at
                    once explained his disquietude, and repudiated the imputation cast upon his
                    writings. The sovereign pontiff lost no time in setting his mind at ease, by
                    explaining to him the cause of the rumour which had been circulated. His
                    holiness declared that he had seen nothing reprehensible in his works, except
                    certain passages concerning temporal jurisdiction; but that he had never had the
                    intention of causing them to be formally censured, persuaded that a man of
                    honour should not be annoyed on the pretext that he had erred in matters which
                    have no relation either to doctrine or to discipline. The health of Muratori,
                    enfeebled by excessive labour, at length declined, and having by the advice of
                    his physicians discontinued his occupations, he went to breathe the air of the
                    country. On his return he hastened to complete some writings which he proposed
                    to publish; but the unfavourable symptoms which had previously excited the
                    apprehensions of his friends soon reappeared in a more dangerous form, and,
                    after languishing for some months, he died on the 23d of January 1750, at the
                    age of seventy-seven. He was buried with much pomp in the church of Santa Maria
                    di Pomposa, whence his remains were, in the year 1774, transported to that of
                    Saint Augustin. Muratori never possessed any other benefice than that of Santa
                    Maria, which, though exceedingly small, appears to have satisfied all his
                    wishes.</p>
