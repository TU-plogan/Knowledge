                        de</hi></label>, a celebrated French historian, the son of Isaac Eudes, a
                    surgeon, was born at Rye, in Lower Normandy, in 1610, and took the surname of
                        <hi rend="italic">Mezerai,</hi> from a hamlet near Rye. Having completed his
                    studies at Caen, he discovered a strong inclination to poetry; but on proceeding
                    to Paris, he was advised by one of his friends to apply himself to the study of
                    politics and history, and procured the place of commissary at war, which he held
                    during two campaigns. He then shut himself up in the college of St Barbe, in the
                    midst of books and manuscripts; and, in 1643, published the first volume of the
                    History of France, in folio. Some years afterwards, the other two volumes also
                    appeared. In that work Mézerai surpassed all who had written the history of
                    France before him, and was rewarded by the king with a pension of four thousand
                    livres. In 1668 he published an Abridgment of his History of France, in three
                    volumes quarto, which was well received by the public; but as he inserted in
                    that work the origin of most of the taxes, with very free reflections, Μ.
                    Colbert complained of it, upon which Mézerai promised to correct what he had
                    done in a second edition. As his corrections, however, amounted rather to
                    palliations than changes or retractations, the minister caused half of his
                    pension to be suppressed. Mézerai complained of this in very severe terms, but
                    the only answer he obtained was the suppression of the other half. Annoyed at
                    this treatment, he resolved to write on subjects which could not expose him to
                    such disappointments, and composed his treatise on the origin of the French,
                    which did him much honour. He was elected perpetual secretary to the French
                    Academy, and died in the year 1683. He is said to have been extremely negligent
                    of his person, and so careless of his dress that he might have passed for a
                    beg-ger rather than a man of letters. He was actually seized one morning by the
                        <hi rend="italic">archers</hi><hi rend="italic">des pauvres,</hi> or parish
                    officers; a mistake which, so far from provoking, highly diverted him. He used
                    to study and write by candle-light, even at noon-day in summer; and, as if there
                    had been no sun in the world, always waited upon his company to the door with a
                    candle in his hand. In regard to religion, he affected a species of Pyrrhonism,
                    which, however, was not so much <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193819235?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9235-0002"/>in his
                    heart as in his mouth, and rather the effect of a contradictory humour than the
                    result of conviction. This appeared from his last sickness; for having sent for
                    those friends who had been the most frequent auditors of his licentious talk
                    about religion, he made a sort of recantation, which he concluded with desiring
                    them to forget what he might formerly have said upon the subject of religion,
                    and to “remember that Mézerai dying was more to be believed than Mézerai
                    living.” The following is a list of the works of Mézerai, viz. 1. Histoire de
                    France, 1643, 1646, 1651, in three vols, folio; 2. Abrégé Chronologique de
                    ΓHistoire de France, 1668, in three vols. 4to; 3. Traité de l’Origine des
                    Français, Amsterdam, 1688, in 12mo; 4. Une Traduction de l’Histoire des Turcs de
                    Chalcondyle, Paris, 1662, in two vols, folio; 5. Une Traduction Française du
                    Traité de Jean de Salisbury, intitulé <hi rend="italic">La Vanité de la
                        Cour,</hi> Paris, 1640, in 4to; 6. Traité de la Vérité de la Religion
                    Chrétienne, translated from the Latin of Grotius, Paris, 1644, in 8vo; 7.
                    Histoire de la Mère et du Fils, that is, of Mary of Medicis and Louis XIII.,
                    Amsterdam, 1730, in 4to. A compilation entitled <hi rend="italic">Mémoires
