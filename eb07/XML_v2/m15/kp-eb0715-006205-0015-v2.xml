                <p part="N"><label type="entry">MIDWIFERY</label>, the art of assisting women in
                    parturition. In a more extended sense, it is understood to comprehend also the
                    treatment of the diseases of women and children. It is obvious that the
                    obstetrical art must have been almost coeval with mankind; but in Europe it
                    continued in a very rude state till the seventeenth century; and even after
                    physic and surgery had become distinct professions, it remained almost totally
                    uncultivated.</p>
                <p part="N">It is a curious fact, that in China the very reverse of this has taken
                    place. In that empire, both physic and surgery are still in a state of
                    degradation; but for some hundreds of years, the art of midwifery has, it is
                    said, been practised by a set of men destined to the purpose by order of
                    government. These persons, who hold in society the same rank which lithotomists
                    formerly did in this country, are called in whenever a woman has been above a
                    specified number of hours in labour, and employ a mechanical contrivance for
                    completing the delivery without injury to the infant. A proportional number of
                    such individuals is allotted to each district containing a certain population.
                    It is said, that the Chinese government was led to make this provision for
                    alleviating the sufferings of women in childbirth, in consequence of a
                    representation, that annually many women died undelivered; and that in the
                    majority of cases the cause of obstruction might have been removed by very
                    simple mechanical expedients.</p>
                <p part="N">Both Sir George Staunton and Mr Barrow were ignorant of this fact; and
                    the latter in particular expressly mentions that there are no men-midwives in
                    China; but we have learned the facts above stated from a gentleman who resided
                    upwards of twenty years as surgeon to the British factory at Canton, and who had
                    both the ability and the inclination to make himself acquainted, during the
                    course of so long a residence, with all the customs and prejudices of the
                    natives relating to the preservation of human life and health.</p>
                <p part="N">Towards the end of the seventeenth century, the same causes which had so
                    long before led to the cultivation of midwifery in China produced the same
                    effect in Europe. The dangers to which women are sometimes exposed during labour
                    excited the compassion of the benevolent; and hence a considerable part of the
                    first hospital which was established for the reception of the indigent sick, the
                        <hi rend="italic">Hotel</hi><hi rend="italic">Dieu</hi> of Paris, was
                    appropriated to lying-in women. The opportunities of practice which that
                    hospital afforded, directed the attention of medical men to the numerous
                    accidents which happen during labour, and to the various diseases which occur
                    after delivery. Public teaching followed, and soon afterwards began the custom
                    of employing men in the practice of midwifery. From this period the art rapidly
                    improved; and it is now in many parts of Europe, particularly in Great Britain,
                    in as great a state of perfection as physic or surgery. There can be no doubt
                    that the improvement of the art of midwifery chiefly arose from medical men
                    directing their attention to the subject; but the propriety of men being
                    employed in such a profession has been much questioned by many individuals of
                    considerable respectability. It appears, indeed, that this question may be
                    brought within a very narrow compass. It may be assumed as a fact established
                    beyond the reach of controversy, that sometimes dangers and difficulties occur
                    during labour, which can be lessened or removed by those only who have an
                    intimate knowledge of the structure of the human body and of the practice of
                    physic. On such occasions, it must be admitted, that medical men alone may be
                    useful. But as such labours occur only in the proportion of two or three in the
                    hundred, the general practice might be confided to midwives, if they could be
                    taught to manage ordinary cases, and to foresee and distinguish difficulties or
                    dangers, so as to procure in sufficient time additional assistance. It is on
                    this point that the decision of the question must depend, and there can be no
                    doubt that women may be taught all this. But there are many who allege, that, a
                    little knowledge being a dangerous thing, midwives acquire a self-sufficiency
                    which renders them averse to calling in superior assistance; and that, in
                    consequence, they often occasion the most deplorable accidents both to the
                    mother and the child. In England this is the popular opinion, and hence women
                    are there almost entirely excluded from the practice of midwifery. A similar
                    prejudice against midwives has, it is believed, begun in some parts of Scotland;
                    but it is presumed this will gradually cease, when it is considered that, in
                    general, the Scotch midwives are regularly instructed, and are at the same time
                    both virtuous and industrious. If they attend strictly to their duty, and
                    invariably prefer the safety of their patients to their own feelings or supposed
                    interest, they will deservedly retain the public confidence. But if in cases of
                    difficulty or danger they trust to their own exertions, or from interested
                    motives decline the assistance of able practitioners, and if they interfere in
                    the treatment of the diseases of women and children, they will in a few years be
                    entirely excluded from practice. For details connected with the practice of
                    midwifery, we refer to the professional works which treat of the subject, and
                    which are too well known to require specification.</p>
