                    nature. In consequence of these changes, which have taken place in public
                    opinion by the introduction of more correct notions of the principles of
                    classification, we have in this edition of our work, resolved on incorporating
                    the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusca</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Concπology,</hi> suppressing the latter term as unnecessary. Indeed, in a
                    physiological point of view, there is no definite boundary between the naked and
                    the shelly species, many of the reputed naked species having shells concealed
                    under their integuments, while in many of the shelly species, the solid plate or
                    shell can only be reached by removing the surrounding soft or fleshy matter. But
                    the propriety of abandoning the old divisions will become sufficiently obvious,
                    when wë consider that all the species belong to one group in the <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Invertebrate</hi> class of animals; that the organs of the
                    species have many points of resemblance; and that although differences prevail
                    in the character of the <hi rend="italic">protecting covering,</hi> the
                    gradations from one condition of the integuments to another, are too minute, in
                    many cases, to admit of precise limits being fixed. We shall therefore consider
                        <hi rend="italic">shells</hi> as peculiar modifications of the external
                    coverings of certain species, and, in this subordinate character, incorporate
                    the naked and shelly species; having recourse to the integuments, however, in
                    connection with the other organs, in the distribution of the genera and other
                    divisions of the class now denominated <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusca.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">In treating of this extensive division of the invertebrate animals, we
                    shall confine our remarks to a general view of their physiology, taking notice
                    of the peculiarities of their forms, organs, and functions. This will prepare us
                    for a condensed view of the progress of the science, in reference to
                    systematical arrangement, and the illustration of the characters of those
                    divisions or groups into which the species may be distributed, whether for
                    assisting the student in his labours of investigation, or for facilitating the
                    judicious disposition of the established truths of the science. We shall then
                    advert, in the last place, to molluscous animals as objects of utility. The
                    limits of the article will unavoidably restrict us to a very brief exposition of
                    the various subjects connected with this very extensive department of natural
                    history.</p>
                <p part="N">CHAP. I PHYSIOLOGY.</p>
                <p part="N">Molluscous animals exhibit very remarkable differences, both in their
                    form and in the number and position of their external members. Neither head nor
                    foot can be observed in some species; the principal organs being enclosed in a
                    bag pierced with apertures for the entrance of the food, and egress of the
                    excrementitious matter. In others, with an exterior still remarkably simple,
                    cuticular elongations, termed <hi rend="italic">Teιιtacula,</hi> surround the
                    mouth, and a foot, or instrument of motion, may likewise be perceived. This last
                    organ is in some free at one extremity, in others attached to the body
                    throughout its whole length. In many species there is,a head, not, however,
                    analogous to that member in the ver-' tcbral animals, and containing the brain
                    and organs of the senses, but distinguished merely as the anterior extremity of
                    the body, separated from the back by a slight groove, and containing the mouth
                    and <hi rend="italic">tentαculα.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">In many of the animals of this division, the different members of the
                    body are in pairs, and are arranged, in reference to a mesial plane, into right
                    and left. In some, a part only of the organs has respect to a mesial plane,
                    other parts being single, or in unequal numbers. In other species, the organs,
                    which are not in pairs, are arranged round a central axis, and give to the
                    external form a radiated appearance. But these characters are exceedingly
                    variable and uncertain, as indicating the limits of particular tribes; since, in
                    different parts of the same animal, modifications of all these forms may be
                    readily distinguished.</p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">skin</hi> of molluscous animals is more simple in
                    its structure, than the same organ in the vertebral animals. The <hi
                        rend="italic">cuticle</hi> is here very distinct; and, as in other classes,
                    it is thick and coarse where much exposed, but thin and delicate in its texture,
                    where it lines the internal cavities. A <hi rend="italic">mucous</hi> web may be
                    detected in the cuttle fish and slug, but of great tenuity. The <hi
                        rend="italic">corium</hi> is destitute of a villous surface; and on its
                    central aspect it is so intimately united to cellular substance, that its
                    fibrous structure can scarcely be distinguished. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >muscular</hi> web maý, in general, be readily perceived. Its fibres proceed
                    in various directions, according to the kind of motion to be executed, and
                    extend or corrugate the skin at pleasure.</p>
                <p part="N">The appendices of the skin in this class of animals ought to be
                    carefully studied, as they furnish the most obvious marks for distinguishing
                    species, and for constructing divisions in their systematical arrangement. The
                    appendices of the cuticle are few in number, and perhaps ought to be considered
                    as limited to <hi rend="italic">hairs.</hi> These, in some species, invest the
                    surface regularly and closely, and may be observed on those which live on land,
                    as well as those which reside in water. In some cases the hairs may be
                    considered as united, and forming continuous crusts or ridges. These hairs, as
                    well as the cuticle, are liable to be worn off, and in some places can seldom be
                    perceived, unless in early age.</p>
                <p part="N">The most important appendix to the skin, for such it must be considered,
                    appears to be the <hi rend="italic">shell.</hi> This part is easily preserved,
                    exhibits fine forms and beautiful colours, and has long occupied the attention
                    of the conchologist. The matter of the shell is secreted by the corium, and the
                    form which it assumes is regulated by the body of the animal. It is coeval with
                    the existence of the animal, and appears previous to the exclusion from the egg;
                    nor can it be dispensed with during the continuance of existence. The solid
                    matter of the shell consists of carbonate of lime, united with a small portion
                    of animal matter, resembling coagulated albumen.</p>
                <p part="N">- The mouth of the shell is extended by the application of fresh layers
                    of the shelly matter to the margin, and its thickness is increased by a coating
                    on the inner surface. These statements are abundantly confirmed by the
                    observations of Reaumur, <hi rend="italic">(Mémoires de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >V</hi><hi rend="italic">Académie</hi><hi rend="italic">des Sciences,</hi>
                    1709), whose accurate experiments have greatly contributed to the elucidation of
                    conchology. If a hole be made in the shell of a snail, and a piece of skin so
                    glued to the inner margin as to cover the opening, the shelly matter will not
                    ooze out from the broken margin of the fracture, and cover the outside of the
                    skin, but will form a coating on its inner surface, <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193823434?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3434-0325"/>thus
                    proving it to have exuded from the body of the animal. When a portion of the
                    mouth of the shell of a snail is broken off, and a piece of skin glued to the
                    inner margin, reflected outwardly, and fixed on the body of the shell, the
                    defective part is again supplied, and the matter added to the inner surface of
                    the skin, thus leaving the interposed substance between the new formed portion
                    and the fractured edge. Similar experiments, repeated on a variety of shells,
                    both univalve and bivalve, by different naturalists, leave no room to doubt that
                    shells increase in size by the juxtaposition of shelly matter from the common
                    integuments.</p>
                <p part="N">Each calcareous layer is more or less enveloped in the animal matter
                    which we have already stated as being present; so that the different layers of
                    successive growth may, by various processes, be distinctly exhibited. If the
                    shell has been exposed for a short time in the fire, the animal matter will
                    appear charred, and its black colour, contrasted with the white earthy matter,
                    will indicate the arrangement of the different strata; in the same manner as the
                    ivory and enamel of a tooth can be distinguished, when subjected to similar
                    treatment. The same satisfactory results may be obtained by a different process.
                    If the shell be steeped in weak muriatic acid, the earthy matter will be
                    dissolved, and the flakes of albumen will remain as the frame-work of the
                    edifice.</p>
                <p part="N">The layers of growth may often be distinguished on the surface of the
                    shell, in the form of striae or ridges, more or less elevated, but parallel to
                    the margin of the aperture. Other inequalities may likewise be observed on the
                    surface, at right angles to the layers of growth, such as ridges, knobs, and
                    spines. These last derive their origin from the inequalities of the skin on
                    which they have been monlded.</p>
                <p part="N">In some univalve shells, the layers of growth parallel to the opening
                    cannot be discerned; when exposedin the fire, there is little darkening of
                    colour; and when dissolved in acids, but a feeble trace of animal matter
                    remains. In the fire, these shells crack in various directions, but exhibit no
                    trace of a scaly structure. By careful management with the file, the shell may
                    be separated into a central layer contiguous to the skin, and a peripheral
                    layer, both similar in structure, though frequently differing in colour. The
                    shells exhibiting such characters have been termed <hi rend="italic"
                        >porcellaneous,</hi> from their dense structure, and the fine polish which
                    their surface presents. The formation of shells of this kind must take place in
                    a different manner from those of the first kind which we have noticed.</p>
                <p part="N">If we attend to the form of a young shell belonging to the genus cypraea
                    of Linnaeus, we may perceive that an addition of shelly matter to the margin of
                    the aperture, in the manner in which it is applied in other shells, would not
                    enlarge the cavity, but completely close the aperture. The increase of the
                    shell, (accompanied with a corresponding increase of its inhabitant), must take
                    place, therefore, either by absorption of the accumulated shelly matter of the
                    mouth, and an elongation in the direction of the greatest curvature of the
                    shell; or the old shell must be thrown off, and a new one produced, suited to
                    the size of the animal. The former supposition has not been entertained, the
                    latter is now generally received by naturalists, though there are a few
                    individuals unwilling to adopt such a view of the matter. The inner coat of such
                    shells appears to be a transudation from the body of the animal, and the outer
                    one to be laid on the surface by the loose reflected lobes of the cloak. In many
                    other shells, portions of matter, more compact than the other parts, may be
                    observed spread on the pillar, and applied to the margin of the mouth by a
                    similar process. Mr. Platt, in support of Reaumur’s opinion, that shells are
                    formed by juxtaposition, against the objections of Mr. Poupart, <hi
                        rend="italic">(Phil. Trans,</hi> vol. liv. p. 43), erroneously considers the
                    different sizes of the cypreae as depending on the thickness of the shell
                    increasing according to age, without admitting a cor responding increase of the
                    dimensions of the contained animal, or cavity for its reception.</p>
                <p part="N">The shells of the first kind which we have noticed, from being formed of
                    cones or layers applied to the inner edge of the margin, and extending beyond
                    it, have an <hi rend="italic">imbricated</hi> structure. Those of the second
                    kind, consisting of layers regularly superimposed, have consequently a <hi
                        rend="italic">lαminateds,twιc-</hi> ture; but between the two kinds there
                    are numerous intermediate links, formed by a combination of the two
                    processes.</p>
                <p part="N">In some cases, the hard parts of the skin are not entitled to the
                    appellation of shell, but may rather be considered as horn. Such are the
                    coverings of the mandibles of the cuttle fish, the branchial lid of the aplysia,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">operculum</hi> of the welk. The two last appendices,
                    however, though horny in some species, are shelly in others.</p>
                <p part="N">The position of the shell, with respect to the constituent layers of the
                    integuments, exhibits very remarkable differences. In some it appears instead of
                    a cuticle, or at least without an external membrane investing it. In general,
                    however, it occurs between the cuticle and the skin; a position which induced
                    Cuvier <hi rend="italic">(Lec.AEAnat. Comp.</hi> xiv. 11.) to consider it as
                    analogous to the mucous web of the vertebral animals. Its intimate connection
                    with the muscular system of the animal, and the protection which it affords,
                    seem adverse to such a conclusion. In many species the testaceous substance
                    occurs in folds of the corium, or inserted in its substance. In this position it
                    never acquires the solid texture which shells exposed, or covered only by the
                    cuticle, exhibit. Those shells which are thus concealed are in general white;
                    those which are more exposed are frequently coloured. The colouring, however,
                    does not depend on the direct exposure to the light, as some have imagined, for
                    many shells which are destitute of a cuticle are white, while many of those
                    covered with a dense cuticle are finely variegated beneath.</p>
                <p part="N">Between the skin and the shell neither vessels nor nerves have been
                    traced; and the manner in which the latter is formed, forbids us to expect their
                    existence. Yet the shell cannot be considered as dead matter, so long as it
                    remains in connection with the living animal. In those animals in which the
                    shell is external, there are muscles which connect the animal with its internal
                    surface, and the bond of union being a substance soluble in water, the muscle
                    can be detached by maceration. The analogy between shell and bone is here
                    obvious, although in the one case the connection between the muscle and the bone
                    is permanent, in the other, between the muscle and shell, temporary, or
                    frequently changed during the life of the animal. But the vitality of the shell,
                    if I may use the expression, is demonstrated, from the changes which it
                    undergoes when detached from the animal: the plates of animal matter harden: the
                    epidermis dries, cracks, and falls off; and in many cases the colours fade or
                    disappear. We confess ourselves unable to point out the means employed by the
                    animal to prevent these changes from taking place, by any process similar to
                    circulation. The difficulty, however, is felt in contemplating the functions of
                    hairs, nails, and feathers, in vertebrated animals.</p>
                <p part="N">When the shelly covering consists of two or more pieces, they are joined
                    together, as the articulated bones in the higher classes of animals, by
                    ligaments. These, in some cases, are of great thickness and strength, and, in
                    consequence of their elasticity, assist in the motion of the different
                    parts.</p>
                <p part="N">In the molluscous animals the skin secretes a viscous, adhesive
                    substance, differing according to the medium in which the animal resides, but in
                    all cases calculated to resist its influence. It is probably owing to the
                    lubricating agency of this secretion, that both the cuticle and shell are
                    preserved from decomposition. The skin likewise secretes the colouring matter by
                    which the shells are variegated.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823447?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3447-0326"/>
                <p part="N">The glands from which it proceeds vary much in different individuals,
                    and even in the same individual in different periods of growth.</p>
                <p part="N">The characters furnished by the skin and its appendices are extensively
                    employed in the systematical arrangement of molluscous animals. Nearly all those
                    characters which distinguish the species, and many of those on which genera are
                    established, are derived from the form of the shell, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >tentacula,</hi> or the colour. This last character, however, is one on
                    which little dependence should be placed.</p>
                <p part="N">There is nothing peculiar in the Μ <hi rend="smallcaps">oscular
                        System</hi> of this class of animals. Where the muscles are inserted in the
                    skin, as is usually the case, that organ is in some cases strengthened by
                    condensed cellular substance, and even acquires a leathery density.</p>
                <p part="N">Molluscous animals preserve themselves in a state of <hi rend="italic"
                        >rest,</hi> chiefly by suction and cementation. The organ which acts as a
                    sucker, is in some cases simple, soft, and muscular, as the foot of the snail,
                    while in others it is compound, and strengthened internally by hard parts, as in
                    the arms of the cuttle fish. The force with which some animals adhere is very
                    considerable, and is strikingly displayed, for example, when we attempt to
                    detach a limpet from the rock.</p>
                <p part="N">The rest, which is maintained by cementation, in some cases depends on a
                    glairy secretion, which glues the body of the animal to the substance to which
                    it Is disposed to be attached. By such an expedient, the shells of snails adhere
                    to rocks, stones, and plants. It is probable that the bivalve shells of the
                    genus Cyclas, which readily adhere to the side of a glass, secure their
                    temporary attachment by means of their glutinous cuticle. In other animals
                    threads are produced, termed a <hi rend="italic">byssus,</hi> from particular
                    glands, and while one extremity is glued to the rock, the other remains in
                    connection with the animal. But there is an attachment more durable than any of
                    these, which takes place in some shells, they being cemented to rocks or stones
                    by calcareous matter, and retained in the same position during the whole term of
                    their existence.</p>
                <p part="N">The locomotive powers of the mollusca are confined to creeping and
                    swimming. The former action is performed by alternate contraction and relaxation
                    of the foot, or muscular expansion, which serves as a sucker, and is analogous
                    to the motion of serpents. The motion of swimming is executed either by the
                    serpentine undulations of the foot and the body, or by the action of tentacula,
                    or expanded portions of the integuments. Many species are aided in swimming, by
                    being able to vary the specific gravity of their body at pleasure, and either
                    rise or sink in the water as circumstances may require. In some, as the
                    Janthina, there is a cellular organ peculiarly destined for this purpose, which
                    may be regarded as in some measure analogous to the air-bladder of fishes. In
                    all these exertions the progress of molluscous animals is proverbially slow.
                    Some bivalve shells have the power of <hi rend="italic">leaping</hi> or shifting
                    their position by a sudden jerk, produced by shutting the valves rapidly. This
                    is strikingly displayed in the common Scallop, and is less perfectly exhibited
                    in the river muscles. In a few instances, especially among the slugs, a thread
                    is formed of the viscous secretion of the skin, by which the animal is enabled
                    to suspend itself in the air from the branches of trees like a spider.</p>
                <p part="N">Although the progressive motions of molluscous animals are comparatively
                    slow, the other muscular actions are executed with ordinary rapidity. The
                    irritability of some parts, as the tentacula and branchiae, is so great, that
                    the protecting movements arc executed almost instantaneously, and the organs are
                    contracted or withdrawn into the body. But these rapid exertions are only called
                    forth in the moments of danger.</p>
                <p part="N">The characters furnished by the muscular system, are of great value in
                    the discrimination of species, and in the con struction of genera and higher
                    divisions. They are intimately connected with the habits of the animal, and
                    merit the attentive examination of the philosophical naturalist.</p>
                <p part="N">In the molluscous animals the <hi rend="smallcaps">Nervous System</hi>
                    is less complicated in its structure than in the higher classes, and the brain
                    is not restricted in its position to the head. The whole nervous system appears
                    in the form of ganglia and filaments. The principal ganglion, or the one to
                    which the term <hi rend="italic">brain</hi> is usually applied, is seated above
                    the gullet or entrance to the stomach. It sends out nerves to the parts about
                    the mouth, the tentacula, and the eyes. It may be considered as analogous to the
                    cerebrum of the vertebral animals. From this ganglion proceed two filaments, one
                    on each side, which in their descent inclose the gullet, and unite underneath to
                    form a second ganglion. From this last, which has been compared to the
                    cerebellum, numerous filaments are likewise distributed to the parts around the
                    mouth, and to the other regions of the body. These filaments in some cases again
                    unite, and form subordinate ganglia. In many cases the brain and ganglia are of
                    a reddish colour, and granιflated structure, while the nerves which issue from
                    them are white and uniform, as in the genus Aplysia. The covering of the first
                    ganglion, which is analogous to the <hi rend="italic">dura mater,</hi> does not
                    adhere to it closely, but leaves a space filled with loose cellular matter. The
                    tunics of the nerves are equally detached; and as they can be inflated or
                    injected readily, some have been led to suppose that the nerves were hollow, and
                    others, that the tunics were the vessels of the lymphatic system.</p>
                <p part="N">The organs of perception common to the higher classes of animals, do not
                    all exist in an obvious manner amongst the mollusca. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >touch,</hi> that universal sense, is here displayed in many cases with
                    great delicacy; and the tentacula, and the other cuticular elongations which we
                    have already referred to, contribute to augment its resources. The sense of <hi
                        rend="italic">sight</hi> is by no means universally enjoyed by the
                    inhabitants of this class. In a few species, the eye is constructed on the plan
                    of the same organ in the vertebral animals. In general, however, it appears only
                    as a black point, the peculiar functions of which can only be inferred from
                    analogy. In many species there is no trace of an eye, consequently they cannot
                    possess that varied information which the others derive from that organ. Where
                    eyes exist in this class, they are uniformly two in number. In one tribe only,
                    namely the cuttle-fish, the rudiments of the organs of <hi rend="italic"
                        >hearing</hi> have been detected. The organs adapted to <hi rend="italic"
                        >smelling</hi> cannot be exhibited, but the existence of the sense is
                    demonstrated by the facility with which molluscous animals discover suitable
                    food, when placed within their reach. The sense of <hi rend="italic">taste</hi>
                    appears to exist, but it is difficult to point out the particular parts of the
                    mouth fitted for its residence. As, however, particular articles of food are
                    selected in pre· ference to others, it may be concluded from analogy that taste
                    regulates the choice.</p>
                <p part="N">In the classification of the mollusca, the characters furnished by the
                    nervous system, from the difficulty of their detection and exhibition, have
                    never come into use. But those furnished by the organs of preception are highly
                    prized. Of these, the eye is the most obvious and constant. It varies in
                    position in different species; but, among individuals of the same species its
                    characters are constant.</p>
                <p part="N">In the cutaneous, muscular, and nervous systems, traces of a general
                    plan may be observed, according to which they have been constructed in the
                    different tribes. In the organs which remain to be considered, there is less
                    uniformity of structure, each family almost, being constructed according to a
                    model of its own.</p>
                <p part="N">The time when molluscous animals feed has not been carefully attended
                    to. Those which live in the water are beyond the reach of accurate observation.
                    Those that reside on land usually shun the light, and creep forth in the <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193823460?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3460-0327"
                    />evenings to commit their depredations. During warm, dry weather, they stir not
                    from their holes.</p>
                <p part="N">The animals under consideration, feed equally on the products of the
                    vegetable and animal kingdom. Those which are <hi rend="italic"
                        >phytivoroιιs</hi> appear to prefer living vegetables, and refuse to eat
                    those which are dried. We are not aware that putrid vegetable matter is consumed
                    by them, although many of the snails and slugs are found under putrid leaves and
                    decayed wood. In these places there is shelter from the sun, together with
                    dampness, so that it is difficult to determine, whether they sojourn in an
                    agreeable dwelling, or a well-stored larder. Those mollusca which are <hi
                        rend="italic">carnivorous,</hi> prey on minute animals in a living state,
                    and many of them greedily attack putrid matter.</p>
                <p part="N">The means employed to bring the food within the reach of the organs of
                    deglutition, are exceedingly interesting, both on account of their variety and
                    success. Some are provided with <hi rend="italic">tentacula</hi> for securing
                    their prey, and conveying it to their mouth, as the cuttle-fish; others protrude
                    a lengthened probosis, or an extended lip or tongue, as the limpet, and thus
                    bring their food into the mouth. By many, however, which are fixed to the same
                    spot during the continuance of existence, or only capable of very limited
                    locomotive power, successful efforts are made to excite currents in the water,
                    whereby fresh portions of it are brought in contact with the mouth, and its
                    animal or vegetable contents separated. Where part only of any kind of food is
                    taken into the mouth at once, the lips are possessed of sufficient firmness to
                    cut off the requisite portions, or there are corneous mandibles to perform the
                    office.</p>
                <p part="N">In the mouth, there is scarcely any process performed analogous to that
                    of mastication, in the higher orders of animals. When the food is in the mouth,
                    or entering into the gullet, it is mixed with saliva, as in the more perfect
                    animals. The <hi rend="italic">salivary glands</hi> in which it is secreted, are
                    in general of considerable size, divided into lobes, and, in some cases,
                    separated into distinct masses. In many species the existence of a gullet is
                    doubtful, as the food seems to enter the stomach immediately; while, in others,
                    there is a portion of the intestinal canal which has some claim to the
                    denomination.</p>
                <p part="N">The stomach, in many instances, is membranaceous, and can scarcely be
                    distinguished from the remaining portion of the intestinal canal. In some cases,
                    however, it is strong and muscular like the gizzard of a bird, and even
                    fortified with corneous knobs for the reduction of hard substances. In some
                    species, the stomach opens laterally into the py-lorous, and, in a few
                    instances, possesses a spiral coecum attached to it.</p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> is usually of very large dimensions,
                    and seated close to the stomach, which it, in many cases envelopes. It is
                    divided into many lobes, and receives numerous bloodvessels. There is, however,
                    nothing analogous to the <hi rend="italic">vena ρortαrum</hi> of quadrupeds. The
                        <hi rend="italic">bile</hi> is poured, in some, into the stomach, and, in
                    others, into the pyloric extremity of the intestine by different openings. There
                    is no gall-bladder.</p>
                <p part="N">There is no division of the canal into small and large intestines, as in
                    the higher classes; or rather, among the mollusca, the relative size of the
                    different parts is reversed. Here the pyloric extremity is usually the largest,
                    while the anal is more slender. The intestine, as in fishes, is short in
                    proportion to the length of the body, and in its course, is subject to few
                    turns. The anus is, in some, placed on one side of the body; in others it is
                    terminal, while in a few it opens on the back.</p>
                <p part="N">The digestive system is thus more simple in its structure than in the
                    higher classes. It possesses neither pancreas, spleen, nor mesentery. And, we
                    may add, that the calls of hunger are often at distant intervals, and the power
                    of abstinence very great.</p>
                <p part="N">The characters furnished by the digestive system are extensively used in
                    the inferior divisions of molluscous animals. The form of the lips, the position
                    of the mouth and anus, and the structure of the stomach, deserve to be
                    attentively considered, as indicating the habits of the species.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Circulating System.</hi> —The process by which the
                    food is converted into chyme, has not been satisfactorily traced, nor has the
                    existence of the lacteals for the absorption of the chyme been demonstrated. In
                    this class of animals the veins seem to perform the offices both of lacteals and
                    lymphatics. The blood is white, or rather of a bluish colour Its mechanical and
                    chemical constitution yct remains to be investigated.</p>
                <p part="N">The circulating system of molluscous animals, exhibits very remarkable
                    differences in the different classes.' In all <hi rend="italic">of</hi> them,
                    however, there is a systemic ventricle; but the other parts of the heart are not
                    of constant occurrence.</p>
                <p part="N">The circulating system furnishes few characters which can be employed in
                    systematical arrangements. The structure of the systemic and pulmonary vessels
                    does not appear to be co-ordinate with any particular plan of external
                    configuration and manner, as wc see in the case of the ptcropoda and
                    gasteropoda. In these, the organs of circulation are very much alike, while the
                    external Forms exhibit very obvious differences.</p>
                <p part="N">The molluscous animals which respire by means of <hi rend="italic"
                        >lungs</hi> arc few in number, and form a very natural tribe, which Cuvier
                    has termed <hi rend="italic">gasterpodes</hi><hi rend="italic">pulmones.</hi> In
                    them the respiratory organ is simple, consisting of a single cavity, on the
                    walls of which the extremities of the pulmonary artery are spread. This cavity
                    communicates externally by an aperture which the animal can open or shut at
                    pleasure.</p>
                <p part="N">The mollusca which breathe by means of <hi rend="italic">gills,</hi>
                    exhibit very remarkable differences, in their number, structure, and position.
                    In some cases, there is a single cavity communicating by an aperture, through
                    which the water enters. The walls of this cavity exhibit an uneven surface,
                    disposed in ridges, which are the gills, and on which the pulmonic artery is
                    expanded. This structure exhibits itself in the <hi rend="italic">Gasteropoda
                        pcctini-branchia.</hi> In many cases the gills, though seated in a cavity,
                    like the former, and equally exposed to the contact of the surrounding element,
                    are two in number, one on each side, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cephalopoda.</hi> In the Bivalvia, they are four in number, two on each
                    side like leaves, and extend the whole length of the body. In these, the water
                    is admitted at the pleasure of the animal.</p>
                <p part="N">The gills of other mollusca are seated externally, and consist either of
                    aborescent productions, or simple cuticular elongations, within which the
                    pulmonary artery terminates. In some of these, as the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pteropoda,</hi> the branchial surface is constantly exposed to the action
                    of the surrounding water; whilst in others, the cuticular expansions, which are
                    analogous to gills, are retractile at the will of the animal. In several
                    examples, these cuticular elongations, which execute the functions of
                    respiration, are covered with moveable cilia, well calculated to excite currents
                    in the water, thus renewing the portions applied to the surface.</p>
                <p part="N">By means of the characters furnished by the circulating and respiratory
                    systems, the molluscous animals may be divided into several distinct classes.
                    But as we shall employ these characters in the construction of the different
                    divisions to be employed, it is unnecessary, in this place, to enter into their
                    details.</p>

                    are considered as destitute of organs for the production of urine, but they
                    possess various organs for the secretion of peculiar fluids or solids, some of
                    which are useful in the arts.</p>
                <p part="N">The coloured fluid, which is secreted by the Cephalopoda and some of the
                    aquatic gasteropoda, appears to consist chiefly of a peculiar mucus, united to a
                    peculiar pigment. The animals which furnish this secretion, eject it when in <pb

                    danger or irritated, and thus envelope themselves in a dark cloud, and elude the
                    pursuit of their foes. A milky secretion is poured forth over the surface of the
                    skin of some slugs when irritated. Other coloured secretions may likewise be
                    detected in the mollusca, to which we shall afterwards advert. The threadlike
                    secretions, termed a <hi rend="italic">byssus,</hi> with which some molluscous
                    animals, especially among the <hi rend="italic">Conchifera,</hi> fix themselves
                    to other bodies, appear to be of an albuminous nature. A few species in this
                    division have the power of secreting a <hi rend="italic">luminous</hi> fluid.
                    Its nature, and the organs in which it is elaborated, have not been
                    investigated. It is probable that some animals, as those which have the faculty
                    of raising or lowering themselves in the water, have likewise the power of
                    secreting <hi rend="italic">air</hi> into those organs which contribute to their
                    buoyancy.</p>
                <p part="N">Morbid secretions likewise occur amongst the animals of this division,
                    chiefly, however, amongst the Conchifera. The most important of these are <hi
                        rend="italic">pearls,</hi> so much prized as ornaments of dress.</p>
                <p part="N">The organs of generation, some of which will be noticed afterwards in
                    detail, furnish many important characters for classification. The external
                    openings are those which are detected with the greatest facility, but the
                    structure of the internal organs exhibits more varied and discriminating
                    marks.</p>

                        >Mollusca</hi> —Molluscous animals, in reference to their condition, are
                    divided, according to the situation in which they reside, into three groups,
                    which may be termed terrestrial, fluviatile, and marine. Those that inhabit the
                    land belong exclusively to the gasteropoda. Among these, some prefer open
                    pastures, others the rubbish of old walls, while not a few reside in woods or
                    among dead leaves and putrid plants. All the animals of this group respire by
                    means of a pulmonary cavity.</p>
                <p part="N">The fluviatile mollusca, or such as reside in fresh waters, include not
                    only many gasteropodous genera, but likewise a few belonging to the Conchifera.
                    Amongst these, some breathe air by means of a pulmonary cavity, and come to the
                    surface to respire. Such species frequent the more shallow ponds and lakes.
                    Others, respiring by means of gills, are less dependent on the shallowness of
                    the water, and consequently reside in different depths.</p>
                <p part="N">The marine mollusca include genera of all the classes. Some burrow in
                    the sand, or adhere to the rocks which are left dry by the receding tide. These
                    are termed <hi rend="italic">littoral</hi> species. Others, however, which have
                    been denominated <hi rend="italic">pelagic,</hi> reside in the deep, and are
                    seldom obtained but by dredging, or when thrown ashore during storms.</p>
                <p part="N">The effect of temperature in regulating the distribution of molluscous
                    animals, has not been investigated with any degree of care or success. Over the
                    terrestrial and fluviatile species, it probably exercises a very powerful
                    control, greatly limiting their geographical range. In proof of this, it may be
                    stated, that the south of France possesses several species not to be found in
                    England, whilst in England, there arc a few which have not been detected in
                    Scotland. But, among the marine mollusca, the influence of climate is not felt
                    in the same degree. Living in an element, the bulk and motions of which guard it
                    equally from the extremes of heat or cold, these animals, like the sea-weeds,
                    have a very extensive latitudinal and longitudinal range. Thus, some are common
                    to Greenland and the Mediteιτanean, others to Britain and the West Indies. The
                    mollusca of the tropical seas, however, differ widely as a whole from those of
                    the temperate regions. Some of the forms appear to be peculiar to warm regions,
                    and, in general, the intensity of colour decreases as we approach the poles. But
                    as there have been few cultivators of this branch of science, the geographical
                    distribution of the species has been but imperfectly explored. Few parts of
                    either England or Scotland have been surveyed by the eye of the helminthologist,
                    so that many species, the range of which is considered as limited, may soon be
                    found to be extensive.</p>
                <p part="N">If the observations are few and imperfect, which have been made on the
                    influence of temperature, in regülating the physical distribution of mollusca,
                    we are still in greater ignorance with regard to the power of habit. In the
                    floe¢z rocks, the relics of marine and fluviatile mollusca are found mixed in
                    the same bed. This circumstance gave rise to the inquiry, how far the mollusca
                    of fresh water can be habituated to sea-water, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                        versa.</hi> In the account of the proceedings of the National Institute of
                    France, for the year 1816, it is stated, that Μ. Beuchant, professor at
                    Marseilles, has directed his attention to this subject. He found, that all these
                    animals die immediately, ifwe suddenly change their place of abode; but that, if
                    we gradually increase the proportion of salt in the water for the one set, and
                    diminish it for the other set, we can, in general, accustom them to live in a
                    kind of water which is not natural to them. He found, however, some species
                    which resisted these attempts, and which could not bear any alteration in the
                    quality of the water in which they reside. Before much confidence can be placed
                    in the accuracy of these results, it would be desirable that the experiments
                    were repeated and varied by other observers. There are, indeed, many sources of
                    error to be guarded against. When we change animals from fresh to salt water, or
                    from salt water to fresh, we must necessarily derange their motions, by
                    compelling them to reside in a medium of a different degree of density from the
                    one in which they have been accustomed to dwell, and to which the arrangement of
                    the different parts of the body is adapted. By such a change of place, it would
                    be difficult for those which breathe air to come to the surface, and descend
                    again in their new situation. In those with gills, the application of a new kind
                    of fluid to the surface of such delicate organs, would considerably influence
                    the function of respiration. The change of situation would likewise be
                    accompanied by a corresponding change of food, and consequently, not merely the
                    organs of locomotion and respiration, but likewise those of digestion, would
                    suffer a derangement in their operations. We know that the power <hi
                        rend="italic">c£suffering</hi> in the animals of this class is very great,
                    and that they survive, though sadly mutilated. Some of the snails will live in a
                    quiescent state for years, without food, and almost without air. Unless,
                    therefore, the animals subjected to these experiments of a change of situation,
                    have been observed to thrive on the food which it spontaneously yields, to
                    execute their accustomed motions, and above all, to propagate their kind, we
                    shall be disposed to conclude, that patient suffering Iras been mistaken for
                    health and vivaciousness for the power of accommodation. ,</p>
                <p part="N">The influence of the <hi rend="italic">seasons,</hi> in regulating the
                    motions and habits of molluscous animals, has been but little attended to. Those
                    which live in the water, avoid the effects of low temperature, on the approach
                    of winter, by retiring to the deeper parts of the lakes or rivers in which they
                    reside. This migration, however, does not, in many cases, furnish the requisite
                    security, so that they betake themselves to burrowing in the mud in which they
                    repose until increasing warmth invites them to return to the open water.</p>
                <p part="N">Among the naked terrestrial mollusca, it may be observed, that they
                    burrow in holes of the earth, under the roots of trees or among moss, and there
                    screen themselves from sudden changes of temperature, and appear to spend the
                    winter in a state of torpidity.</p>
                <p part="N">The different kinds of shelly mollusca which inhabit the land, such as
                    those belonging to the genera Helix, Bulimus, and Pupa, not only retire to
                    crevices of rocks and other places, for safety in the winter season, but they
                    form an operculum or lid for the mouth of the shell, calculated to exclude the
                    access of the air, and by the intervention of which they likewise adhere to the
                    wall of their dwelling. A <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823486?mode=fullsize"

                    accompanied by moisture, excites their revival and motion, and the lid becomes
                    detached. If we bring, for example, the <hi rend="italic">Helix</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">nemoralis,</hi> from its cold abode, and in an apparently
                    torpid state, with the mouth of its shell closed by the lid and adhering to a
                    stone, into a warm apartment, it will speedily revive, especially if it be
                    moistened with a little water, burst open the lid and begin to crawl. If the
                    animal be again exposed to a low temperature, it again secretes materials for a
                    new lid, and speedily returns to its slumbers or inactivity. The first formed
                    opercula, in these animals, always contain a considerable proportion of
                    carbonate of lime, a material which is found in smaller quantity in those of
                    after formation. If the animal has revived frequently during the winter, the
                    last formed opercula will be observed to consist chiefly of animal matter, and
                    to be very thin. The first formed winter lid of the Helix Pomatia is of the
                    consistence of card-paper.</p>
                <p part="N">All the land shelly mollusca appear tc⅛have the power of passing into a

                    and independent of low temperature. Thus, even in midsummer, if we place in a
                    box specimens of the <hi rend="italic">Helix</hi><hi rend="italic">hortensis,
                        nemoralis aut arbustorum,</hi> without food, in a day or two they form for
                    themselves a thin operculum, become attached to the Side of the box, and assume
                    a dormant condition. In this state of apparent torpidity they may be kept for
                    several years. No ordinary change of temperature produces any effect upon them,
                    but they speedily revive if moistened or plunged in water. Even in their natural
                    haunts, they arc often found in this dormant state, during the summer season,
                    especially when there is a continued drought. Thus the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Helix</hi><hi rend="italic">nemoralis</hi> may frequently be observed
                    several feet from the ground, and attached to the stem or leaves of plants, with
                    the mouth of the shell closed.</p>
                <p part="N">But it is not drought which influences these terrestrial shelly mollusca
                    to assume this quiescent state. The <hi rend="italic">Succineα</hi><hi

                    leaves of the Water Flag, having retired from the moisture below. In the same
                    manner, and from causes equally obscure, some of the marine shelly mollusca, as
                    the Limpet, Periwinkle, and Trochus, may be observed in a quiescent state on the
                    rocks, above the reach of the tide. A shower, however, in general excites the
                    Succinea, as well as the Limpets and Periwinkles, to motion.</p>
                <p part="N">CHAP. II PROGRESS OF THE SCIENCE.</p>
                <p part="N">Naturalists have pursued a variety of methods in their examination of
                    this important branch of Zoology, and have proposed systems of arrangement
                    founded on very different principles, and marking different epochs in the
                    science. In the methodical distribution observed by some, the form of the shelly
                    covering has been exclusively attended to, while the organization of the animal
                    itself has been overlooked, or even disregarded. A few have made the habits of
                    the animal, the groundwork of their system. Others have passed over the
                    characters exhibited by the forms and structure of the shell, and have confined
                    their attention exclusively to the form and structure of the contained animal.
                    Lastly, there have been a few, who, embracing all the circumstances connected
                    with the shell, the animal, and its habits, have constructed systems at once
                    natural and convenient. In the following sections we propose to consider these
                    four classes into V. Inch the cultivators of this department of science may be

                <p part="N">1 he arrangement of the testaceous mollusca, according to the different
                    forms of the shell, is unquestionably the most obvious and the most ancient
                    method. It was first employed by Aristotle, the father of natural history, and
                    even in the present day its admirers are warm in its praiseι It is with great
                    propriety termed the <hi rend="italic">artificial method,</hi> because the <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> characters employed have but a remote relation to
                    the more important functions of the animal. This eminent philosopher had the
                    merit of forming the great divisions of <hi rend="italic">univalves</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">bivalves.</hi> He likewise separated the turbinated univalves
                    from such as have but an imperfect spire, and formed many genera, or rather
                    families, still retaining the names which he imposed.</p>
                <p part="N">The progress of the study of the shelly mollusca (the naked kinds being
                    in a great measure neglected,) made very little progress for many ages after
                    Aristotle had published his method of arrangement. Indeed, the first work of
                    this sort which claims attention, is the <hi rend="italic">Dictionarium
                        Ostracolo-gicum</hi> of Major, which was published in 1675. To him we are
                    indebted for the threefold division of shells into <hi rend="italic">univalves,
                        bivalves,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">multivalves,</hi> and for an
                    explanation of the terms then employed by conchologists.</p>

                    glances at the great clue to simplicity, which was afterwards so successfully
                    and admirably seized by the great reformer of natural history in general.” But
                    Langius deserves more praise than is here bestowed upon him. Before his system
                    appeared, the characters of the genera depended principally on the <hi

                    the defect, by directing the attention <hi rend="italic">of</hi> conchologists
                    to the form of the mouth in univalves, and to the structure of the hinge in

                    the latter, the circumstance did not escape him, that some of these shells are

                    they have availed themselves, without, however, acknowledging their origin.</p>

                    character, and one of easy application, having observed that, in some genera,
                    the valves do not close or unite all round, but that, at certain places, the

                    alterations; but his attempts to reform the science of conchology, were far from
                    being equally successful. To the subject he never was much attached, nor does he
                    appear to have availed himself sufficiently of the labours of those authors whom
                    we have mentioned, and of others who preceded him. The ' primary divisions which
                    he employed, were those which Major had established, and his genera, with a few
                    exceptions, were those in common use. His merit as a conchologist rests entirely
                    on the accurately defined terms, the concise specific characters, and the
                    convenient trivial names which he employed and introduced. The particular
                    consideration of the Linnaean genera, and the subsequent changes which have been
                    introduced into them, will form the subject of a separate section.</p>
                <p part="N">For some time after the publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Systema</hi><hi rend="italic">Nα-turae,</hi> the illustrious Swede enjoyed
                    a very dangerous reputation. All his arrangements were regarded as of such high
                    authority, that it was considered as impious to attempt to introduce any change;
                    so that conchology, and along with it the study of the mollusca, according to
                    the artificial method, remained a long time stationary. At last in France, a
                    country which refused to submit to the fetters of the Linnaean school, several
                    new systems were proposed, which had for their object the restoration of those
                    well-founded genera, which Linnaeus, in his too great desire to simplify, had
                    suppressed, and the accommodation of the divisions of the science to those new
                    relations which a more extensive knowledge of species had discovered. In this
                    number Bose stands eminently conspicuous. In his work entitled <hi rend="italic"

                    acquainted with various species of minute nautili produced on the northern
                    shores. Nor did those discoveries fail to excite interest in this country. Boys
                    and Walker devoted their attention to the subject, and gave to the world the
                    result of their labours, in a thin quarto, entitled, <hi rend="italic">Testacea

                    conchologists as useless, so that the minute species are excluded from their
                    systems. But it is surely a strange method of proceeding in natural history, to
                    judge of the merits or importance of species from their size. It is true that we
                    are still ignorant of the inhabitants of those shells, and may long continue to
                    be so; but our present knowledge of these shells has enabled us to fill up many
                    blanks, to perceive several new relations, and even to draw some important
                    conclusions.</p>

                <p part="N">That this sort of inquiry has in many instances been injudiciously
                    conducted, all who are acquainted with the subject must admit. Due care has not
                    been taken to distinguish these minute testacea from the fry of the larger
                    shells, so that the number of species has been very injudiciously multiplied.
                    These remarks apply to several figures of Walker, and to a still greater number
                    of those of Adams.</p>

                <p part="N">The authors of the preceding class have laboured to bring to perfection
                    the artificial system of conchology, and have formed their arbitrary characters,
                    independent of the habits of life of the contained animal. But the naturalists
                    whom we have now to consider, have traced these animals to their lurking places,
                    and arranged them according to the situation in which they reside, instead of
                    the forms which they exhibit.</p>
                <p part="N">At the head of this class of conchologists, Dr. Martin Lister stands
                    pre-eminently conspicuous. His great work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Historia

                        Conchyliorum,</hi> was begun in 1685, and completedin 1692. It will long
                    remain a monument of the extensive information and unwearied diligence of its
                    author. The following synoptical view of the work will enable our readers to
                    comprehend its plan; the original should be consulted with care.</p>

                <p part="N">The plan followed by Sir Robert Sibbald in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Scotia</hi><hi rend="italic">Illustrata</hi> is somewhat different from
                    that of Lister. He divides the Testacea into two classes, land and water shells,
                    and the latter class he subdivides into fluviatile and marine. His inferior
                    divisions are destitute of precision, and the number of species referred to
                    limited.</p>
                <p part="N">The system of D’Argenville, which was so much esteemed and so long
                    followed in France, is essentially the same with that of Lister in the higher
                    divisions. The plan is indeed so simple, and in appearance so natural, that it
                    has met with many admirers. It has even been useful in encouraging naturalists
                    to study particular departments of the science, when they were prevented by
                    their situation from devoting their attention to the whole. It is probably to
                    this circumstance that we are indebted to Schröter for his observations on the
                    land shells in the neighbourhood of Thangelstadt, and on the river shells of
                    Thuringia.</p>
                <p part="N">The preceding arrangements, formed according to the situations in which
                    the animals reside, and not according to their external coverings, may be

                    as an introduction to a new class of authors, whose views may be considered as

                    the tentacula, and the number and position of the eyes. The families amongst the
                    bivalves are arranged according to the structure of their cloak or external
                    covering. In the class of multivalves, which we have omitted in the table, the
                    characters are taken from the form and structure of the shell.</p>
                <p part="N">The work of Geoffroy, entitled, <hi rend="italic">Traité Sommaire des
                        Coquilles tant</hi><hi rend="italic">fluviatiles</hi><hi rend="italic">que
                        terrestres, qui se trouvent aux environs de Paris,</hi> 1767, is constructed
                    upon the principles of Adanson. Here, however, the objects were not sufficiently
                    numerous to admit of all the subdivisions of that author, but he has made the
                    form of the animal subservient to the construction of generic characters.</p>
                <p part="N">After these attempts to classify the animals which inhabit shells had
                    been made in France, the celebrated zoologist of Denmark, O. F. Müller, turned
                    his attention to the same subject. In the <hi rend="italic">Zoologia
                        Danica,</hi> which contains his digested views of the subject, he employs,
                    in the construction of his genera of univalves, the characters first used by
                    Adanson; but among the bivalves, besides the form of the tubes or syphon, he
                    notices the construction of the branchiae and the presence or absence of a
                    foot.</p>
                <p part="N">To our knowledge of the animals which inhabitbivalves, Poli, in his
                    expensive work, <hi rend="italic">Ú\e History of the Shells of the Two
                        Sicilies,</hi> made very important additions. In the construction of his
                    families, which are six in number, he employs merely the characters furnished by
                    the syphon and foot. In the first family the animal has two syphons and a foot;
                    in the second, there <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823525?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0715-3525-0332"/> is only one syphon and foot; in the third, a
                    syphon and no feet; in the fourth there is an abdominal syphon and no feet; in
                    the fifth there is a foot but no syphon; while, in the sixth, neither foot nor
                    syphon can be discovered. In the formation of his genera, Poli takes advantage
                    of the various forms of the cloak and the branchiae.</p>
                <p part="N">To the celebrated Cuvier, the conchologist is also under tlιc greatest
                    obligations. By applying his vast knowledge of anatomy to the examination of the
                    molluscous animals, he has unfolded many new conformations of parts, and
                    exhibited many unlooked-for relations. The vast collection of objects, the
                    spoils of all the museums of the continent, which Paris once possessed, lay open
                    to his inspection, and his industry appears to have been equal to the harvest
                    which invited him to labour.</p>
                <p part="N">In his first attempts to classify the molluscous animals, as contained
                    in his <hi rend="italic">TableauElémentairc</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi

                    which the preceding writers had developed, in his inferior divisions; but in his
                    primary distinctions, he distributed the mollusca into three classes: <hi
                        rend="italic">Cephalopoda,</hi> having the head covered with tentacula,
                    serving as feet; <hi rend="italic">Gasteropoda,</hi> with the head free, the
                    animal crawling on the belly; and <hi rend="italic">Acephala,</hi> having no
                    distinct head.</p>
                <p part="N">Some years after the appearance of this classification, Cuvier directed
                    more of his attention to the internal structure of the mollusca, and, by means
                    of accurate dissections, obtained a more intimate acquaintance with the organs
                    and functions of these animals than any of his predecessors had acquired. The
                    information which he thus gained was communicated to the public at different
                    periods, in the well-known publication <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi

                    drawn exclusively from the animal. In the third volume, of what may be termed
                    the third edition of that invaluable work, published in 1830, the same
                    arrangement, with the exception of a few modifications, was adhered to.</p>
                <p part="N">He divides the mollusca into six classes, which he terms <hi

                        >Acephala,</hi><hi rend="italic">Brachiopoda,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cirrhipoda.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">In the class <hi rend="smallcaps">Cephalopoda,</hi> the body is in the
                    form of a sack, open above, containing the branchiae, with a distinct head,
                    surrounded by fleshy elongations or arms, adapted for moving the body or seizing
                    prey. Into this class, along with the Sepia of Linnaeus, Cuvier has inserted the
                    multilocular shells of his genus <hi rend="italic">Nautilus</hi> and the genus
                        <hi rend="italic">Argonauta.</hi> But it is to be feared, that our knowledge
                    of the testaceous mollusca which inhabit the numerous multilocular shells, is
                    too limited to enable us to assign to all of them their true place in a natural
                    arrangement of animals.</p>
                <p part="N">In the second class, termed <hi rend="smallcaps">Pteropoda,</hi> the
                    body is closed, the head is destitute of the long fleshy arms which distinguish
                    the animals of the preceding division; two fin-like membranes, situate.on the
                    sides of the neck, and on which the branchial tissue is in general spread, serve
                    as organs of motion. There is only one shelly mollusca belonging to this class,
                    viz., the anomia tridentata of Forskaehl, now forming a part of the genus
                    hyaloea.</p>
                <p part="N">The third class, which includes a great number of naked and testaceous
                    mollusca, and to which Cuvier gives the name <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Gasteropoda,</hi> from the circumstance of the belly being formed for
                    crawling, has been subdivided into eight orders, from circumstances connected
                    with the organs of respiration.</p>
                <p part="N">In the first order, termed <hi rend="italic">Pulmones,</hi> which
                    breathe air, he has constituted two divisions, the terrestrial and the aquatic.
                    The animals of the former live on land, and were included by Linnaeus in his
                    genera limax and turbo. They are the land shells of most authors. Those of the
                    division, termed aquatic, live in the water, but require at intervals to come to
                    the surface to obtain fresh air. They constitute, with a few exceptions, the
                    fresh water shells of naturalists. In the second and third orders, or <hi
                        rend="italic">Nudibranches</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lnfero-branches,</hi>
                    the species consist almost entirely of genera formed from the animals which
                    Linnaeus and many others included in the genus doris. They are naked mollusca,
                    and are likewise destitute of any internal testaceous plate. The fourth order,
                    termed <hi rend="italic">Tectibranches,</hi> contains animals whose branchiae,
                    like small leaves more or less divided, are situate on the right side, or upon
                    the back. The animals of this division possess a shell, but it is in general
                    placed beneath the common integuments, such as the genus <hi rend="italic"
                        >Aplysia</hi> and several species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Eulla.</hi>
                    The fifth order, termed <hi rend="italic">Heter-οpodcs,</hi> have the gills
                    plumore and dorsal, with the foot compressed and vertical like a fin, with a
                    small portion of it only formed to act as an organ of adhesion, as in the other
                    gasteropoda. The <hi rend="italic">Pectinibranches</hi> form the sixth order,
                    and are distinguished by the branchiae, which are like leaves or threads placed
                    parallel in one, two, or three lines, on the surface of the pulmonary cavity,
                    and by having the sexes separate. It includes the whole of the marine species of
                    the Linnaean genera of turbinated univalves. Into this order, Cuvier, from the
                    consideration of other characters, has inserted the genus <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cyclostoma,</hi> which, according to the characters indicated by the
                    respiratory organs, belongs to the Pulmones.</p>
                <p part="N">In the seventh order, termed <hi rend="italic">Scuiibr</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">anches,</hi> the branchiae are similar to those of the
                    preceding order, but the sexes are united, each individual being capable of
                    impregnating or being impregnated. The shells in general are cup-shaped, and
                    destitute of a lid. It includes the genus Halyotis, and many species of the old
                    genus Patella. In the last order, called <hi rend="italic">Cyclobranches,</hi>
                    the branchiae appear in the form of small leaves or pyramids strung round the
                    under margin of the cloak. They enjoy a hermaphroditism similar to those of the
                    preceding order. The species of the genus Patella which are allied to the
                    vulgata, and the genus Chiton, are included in this order.</p>
                <p part="N">In the fourth class, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Acephλt,a,</hi> he includes
                    the bivalve shells, distributing them into families, from characters nearly
                    similar to those which we have pointed out as having been previously employed by
                    Poli.</p>
                <p part="N">The fifth class, termed <hi rend="smallcaps">Brachiopoda,</hi> contains
                    animals, resembling those of the preceding class in having a cloak of two lobes,
                    but these are always open. The branchiae consist of small leaves placed on the
                    inner margin of each lobe. In place of a foot they have two retractile fleshy
                    arms, which are extensile. This class includes the Patella unguis of Linnaeus,
                    the genus Terebratula and the Patella anomala of Müller.</p>
                <p part="N">The class <hi rend="smallcaps">Cirrhipoda,</hi> distinguished by the
                    articulated filaments with which the animals are furnished, contains the species
                    of the genus Lepas of Linnaeus. The shells belonging to the Linnaean genera
                    Sarpula and Dentalium, are transferred to the class termed Annelides.</p>
                <p part="N">This system of the molluscous animals is unquestionably the most perfect
                    of all those which have been published. But, with all its excellence, we must
                    inform the reader, that many species, nay, whole genera, have their places
                    assigned them in this natural method, merely because the shells occupied a
                    similar position in the artificial system, the form of the inhabitants being
                    unknown.</p>

                    production of the late industrious Lamark, one of the most celebrated zoologists
                    of the French school. The <hi rend="italic">Système des Animaux sans

                    animals included in the classes Insectaand Vermes of Linnaeus. Where treating of
                    the Mollusca he divides them into two orders. The first, termed <hi

                    lived to finish between the years 1818 and 1822. The arrangement adopted in this
                    invaluable work, has been greatly admired, a circumstance which induces us to
                    give the following synoptical view of its contents. '</p>

                    are in this system of Lamark distributed into three great divisions or classes,

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusca.</hi> These classes he has subdivided
                    according to the following tabular view:</p>
