                    extent one of the least, yet, as containing within it the metropolis of the
                    British empire, with its numerous population, its extensive wealth, and its
                    repositories of art and science, and being the theatre of the most interesting
                    historical and political transactions, naturally attracts to it the attention of
                    all who are connected with the united kingdoms.</p>
                <p part="N">This county is bounded on the north by Hertfordshire; on the west by
                    Buckinghamshire; on the south by Surrey, and at the eastern point by a small
                    portion of Kent; and on the east by Essex. Its general figure is quadrangular,
                    but rendered very irregular by the course of the rivers Thames, Coln, and Lea,
                    which bound it on three sides, and by a considerable projection into
                    Hertfordshire on the north. Its greatest length is twenty-three and its greatest

                    1,358,330, of whom 631,410 were males and 726,920 were females. These composed
                    314,039 families, of whom 9882 were chiefly occupied in agriculture; 173,822
                    were chiefly occupied in trade, manufactures, and handicraft; and the remainder,
                    130,335, were not comprehended in either of these two classes.</p>

                    males 526, of females 380.</p>
                <p part="N">The proportion of burials to the whole population, which in 1801 was one
                    in thirty-one, was in 1830 one in forty-two. The amount expended for the relief
                    of the poor had varied but little during the ten years from 1820 to 1830. In the
                    first of these years it amounted to L.625,665, and in the last to L.68l,567.</p>

                    year 1815, was L.5,595,337. The increase of the population is shown by the
                    several decennial enumerations to have been as follows, viz. in 1801, 818,129;
                    in 1811, 953,276, being an increase of seventeen per cent.; in 1821, 1,144,531,
                    being an increase of twenty per cent.; and in 1831, 1,358,200, being an increase
                    of nineteen per cent. The whole increase in the thirty years has been sixty-five
                    per cent. If the same rate of increase should .continue till 1841, which there
                    seems no reason to doubt, the county will then have doubled its inhabitants in
                    about the period of forty or forty-one years.</p>
                <p part="N">The county is divided into six hundreds, and the three cities of London
                    within the.,walls, London without the walls, and Westminster. The most populous
                    of the hundreds, that of Ossulstone, is formed into four divisions.</p>

                <p part="N">The face of this county may be described as a gently sloping tract
                    rising from the banks of the Thames, its southern boundary, to the hills on the
                    north, none of which rises more than 350 feet above the level of that river, and
                    few attain even that height. In receding from the banks of the stream, the
                    surface is gently undulated, with sufficient slope to secure the necessary
                    drainage. The prospects in the southern division of the county, from the level
                    nature of its surface, are not distinguished by extent or variety; and the eye
                    is only relieved from the fatigue of uniformity, by the numerous buildings,
                    plantations, gardens, and the rich verdure of productive grass fields. Even in
                    the more hilly parts of the county the prospects are far less impressive than
                    those upon the opposite banks of the Thames, or those which are to be seen upon
                    the borders of that river before it enters Middlesex. The best prospects of a
                    rural kind are from the range of hills stretching from Pinner, Stanmore,
                    Elstree, Totteridge, and Barnet, to the forest scenery of Enfield Chace. The
                    Hill of Harrow, a projection from this ridge, is one of the highest points; and
                    the whole of the richly-cultivated valley of Middlesex is comprehended in the
                    view from it.</p>
                <p part="N">The original soil on the southern side of the county is of a most
                    sterile kind of gravel; but the vast quantities of manure which have been
                    furnished to it from the extensive cities in its vicinity, have been so spread
                    over the surface, that a most luxuriantly-productive soil of garden mould has
                    been created; and from the same cause it is renewed as rapidly as it becomes
                    exhausted by the crops grown upon it. The northern part of the county generally
                    consists of a soil of clayey loam, which, though rather difficult to plough, is,
                    when properly pulverised, very well adapted for the cultivation of wheat, and
                    has been long celebrated for the excellent quality of that grain which is
                    produced upon it. The table of Queen Elizabeth was regularly furnished with
                    white bread from the wheat grown in the vicinity of Hounslow. In several parts
                    of the county the loamy clay, converted by the addition of cinders, technically
                    called breeze, into bricks, becomes the most profitable application of the soil.
                    This is peculiarly the case where such soil is found in the immediate vicinity
                    of the metropolis, or upon the banks of the rivers or canals that communicate
                    with it. “Round the one-mile stone on the Kingsland Road,” says Mr Middleton, «
                    the surface is <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819989?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0715-9989-0060"/>lowered from four to ten feet, by the earth
                    having been dug up and manufactured into bricks, over an extent of more than
                    1000 acres; and it has been levelled, ploughed up, and laid down to grass. It is
                    sufficiently dry, and by the help of town manure is restored again to excellent
                    grass land; though it had previously yielded to the community, through the
                    medium of the brickmakers, upwards of L.4000 per acre on an average of the whole
                    level; but there are a few acres of choice marl earth, which have produced
                    through the same medium L.20,000 per acre.”</p>
                <p part="N">The greater portion of the land in the county is appropriated to the
                    cultivation of grass, which is converted into hay for the supply of the numerous
                    horses kept in the metropolis. These upland meadows have been gradually
                    extending as the metropolis has increased, so that at present not more than
                    20,000 acres are under cultivation by the plough. The meadows, however, even
                    those which have been longest laid down in herbage, discover the marks of their
                    having been formerly ploughed. The great consumption of hay in the London
                    markets has induced the most skill to be applied to that particular branch of
                    rural economics which, under the term haymaking, is usually deemed the simplest
                    of all agricultural operations, but which is here managed in so superior a way
                    as to bring to the stack hay of a quality far better than is preserved in the
                    more distant counties. The corn grown in this county is inconsiderable. Upon an
                    average of years, about 10,000 acres are sown with wheat, about 4000 with
                    barley, about 3000 with beans, and about 2000 with pease; some rye is grown, but
                    principally for green food, and scarcely any oats are cultivated. There are
                    fewer sheep and cows kept in Middlesex than in any other county; but of the
                    latter some thousands are maintained solely for the purpose of supplying milk
                    for the consumption of the metropolis. Many pigs are fattened from the offal
                    produced in the vast breweries and malt distilleries of London and its
                    vicinity.</p>
                <p part="N">The horticulture of Middlesex, although it does not extend over quite so
                    great a surface as its arable culture, produces a far greater annual return.
                    Exclusively of the gardens attached to the houses of the nobility and gentry,
                    the extent of land appropriated to the growth of fruit is reckoned by Mr
                    Middleton to be 3000 acres, of that devoted to culinary vegetables 10,000, and
                    of that used as nursery grounds and plantations 1500. The same writer estimated
                    the annual value of the productions of horticulture at somewhat more than one
                    million sterling. The gardeners of Middlesex practise a wonderful economy in the
                    raising of crops. The fruit gardeners have what they call an upper and an under
                    crop growing on the same ground at the same time. First, the ground is stocked
                    with apples, pears, cherries, plums, walnuts, &amp;c. like a complete orchard,
                    and Called the upper crop. It is secondly fully planted with raspberries,
                    gooseberries, currants, strawberries, and all such fruits, shrubs, and herbs as
                    are known to sustain the shade and drippings from the trees above them without
                    the least injury; this they term the under crop. Some of these gardens have
                    walls which are completely clothed with fruit-trees, such as peaches,
                    nectarines, apricots, plums, and various others, all adapted to the aspect of
                    the wall. In order to increase the quantity of warmth and shelter in autumn,
                    they raise earthen banks of about three feet in height, laid to a slope of
                    forty-five degrees to the sun. On these slopes they plant endive in the month of
                    September; and near the bottoms of them they drill pease from October to
                    Christmas; by this means the endive is preserved from rotting, and, as well as
                    the pease, reaches maturity at an early period. The common routine of the best
                    kitchen gardeners is the following: Soon after Christmas, when the weather is
                    open, they begin by sowing the borders, and then the quarters, with radishes,
                    spinach, onions, and all the other seed crops. As soon afterwards as the season
                    will permit, which is generally in February, the same ground is planted with
                    cauliflowers from the frames, as thick as if no other crop had then possession
                    of the ground. The radishes, &amp;c. are soon sent to market; and when the
                    cauliflowers are so far advanced as to be earthed up, sugar-loaf cabbages are
                    planted from the before-mentioned seed crops; and daily as these crops are sent
                    to market, the same ground is cropped with celery for winter use. The foregoing
                    rotation is the common practice, but there are many deviations, according to the
                    judgment of the cultivators, the state of the weather, and the demands of the
                    market. Such a system, however, can be pursued only in the vicinity of great
                    cities, the abundant manure of which gives the means of raising vegetable
                    productions in defiance of the inclemency of our northern winters. A species of
                    cultivation of a nondescript kind, partaking of the nature of agriculture and
                    horticulture, is extensively pursued in this county. The ground is ploughed in
                    January and February, and cropped with early pease, which are gathered green in
                    June. The land is then sowed with turnips, which are sold in autumn, when the
                    kind of cabbages called collards are planted, and these three crops are annually
                    raised from the same soil.</p>
                <p part="N">Manufactures of every kind may be ascribed to this county, in so far as
                    the best workmen of every description are employed in London for combining,
                    fitting, and finishing all the commodities requisite for the consumption of the
                    metropolis, which is at the same time the seat of government, the temporary
                    residence of the wealthiest subjects of Great Britain, and the greatest sea-port
                    of the empire , but workmen of this kind, forming more than 400 classes, cannot
                    be here so appropriately described as under the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >London,</hi> to which the reader is referred.</p>

                        >manufacture,</hi> none of importance can be attributed to Middlesex, other
                    than that of silk, which subsists in Spittaifields, and which employs upwards of
                    5000 males above twenty years of age. In St Mary’s parish, Whitechapel, 440 men
                    of that age are employed in sugar-refining. Ship-building, and the various
                    auxiliaries of that art, such as rope-making, sail-making, block-making,
                    anchor-making, and the fabrication of copper sheathing and bolts for ships, with
                    numerous smaller articles, employ a great number of persons. There are
                    manufactories of chemical preparations at Bow, mustard-mills at Staines,
                    copper-works at Harefield, and mills for throwing silk in many places.</p>
                <p part="N">The rivers of Middlesex are, the Thames, the Coln, the Brent, and the
                    Lea. The former of these is navigable for barges, along almost its whole extent,
                    to Leachlade in Gloucestershire, within a few miles of its source. The tide is
                    felt as high as Teddington, above which the navigation is performed by penning
                    the ∖vater at various locks till a sufficient body is collected, which, by
                    making what is locally called a <hi rend="italic">flash,</hi> permits the
                    passage of the barges over the obstructions and shoals, which, a few hours
                    after, become again impassable. The picturesque beauties on the banks of*this
                    stream are too well known to need a description in this place. The Coin is not
                    navigable. It enters Middlesex from Hertfordshire at the north-western extremity
                    of the county, and falls into the Thames in various channels at considerable
                    distances from each other, having in its course been applied to the working of
                    numerous mills for paper, corn, and other purposes. The Brent, also not
                    navigable, enters the county from Hertfordshire, and joins the Thames at
                    Brentford. The Lea is navigable for barges along its whole course through this
                    county. It enters from Hertfordshire, forms the eastern boundary of Middlesex,
                    and joins the Thames at Limehouse, below London. Besides these natural streams,
                    the artificial one called the New River belongs to this county. The artificial
                    channel in which this stream flows towards London has a very devious<pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193820002?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0002-0061"/>
                    course, in order to keep the waters at a due level. It is ultimately received
                    into a spacious reservoir near Islington, whence, by means of pipes, its water
                    is conveyed through the streets of the metropolis to the houses of
                    individuals.</p>
                <p part="N">Amongst the public works of this county, the canals deserve notice.
                    These are, the Grand Junction, the Paddington, and the Regent’s Canal. The first
                    forms a connection with the whole interior of the kingdom, and the second is
                    connected with it. Through them, internal navigation is conducted to the
                    manufacturing counties, and to the distant ports of Liverpool, Bristol, and
                    Hull, and to the potteries, iron-fonnderies, and collieries of Staffordshire and
                    Warwickshire. The Regent’s Canal surrounds the whole of the northern side of the
                    metropolis, around which it describes a semicircle, commencing at the dock of
                    the Paddington Canal, and terminating at the river Thames at Limehouse. Its
                    principal utility is supposed to be derived from forming the means of conveying
                    coals and other heavy commodities from the river to the more distant parts of
                    the capital without expensive land-carriage. We may here notice two works
                    actually in operation, which may become of vast importance. These are, the
                    railroad from London to Birmingham, which has been considerably advanced, and a
                    similar one to Southampton, already commenced. For another to Bristol an act of
                    parliament has been obtained.</p>
                <p part="N">The docks constructed of late years for the facilities of commerce are
                    most extensive and magnificent works, and the warehouses which surround them are
                    wonderful exhibitions of the commercial opulence of this country, having been
                    all completed from the capitals of individuals. The West India Docks contain
                    about sixty acres of water, in which the largest vessels can float. The London
                    or Wapping Docks arc of nearly the same extent. The St Catherine’s Docks,
                    finished in 1828, can accommodate annually 1400 vessels; and, being near the
                    centre of the trading establishments, are found of vast benefit. The East India
                    Docks are more than thirty acres; and near them is a dock belonging to private
                    individuals (Messrs Wigram and Green), of nearly twenty acres, where the
                    business of shipbuilding is carried on upon a scale which exceeds that of most
                    of the establishments of the governments of Europe.</p>
                <p part="N">The most remarkable edifices of this county are more properly described
                    under the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">London</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Westminster</hi> in this work. Beyond the limits of these cities may be
                    noticed the· palaces of Hampton Court and Kensington; the Hospital of Chelsea,
                    for invalid soldiers; the Royal Military Asylum; the bridges of Staines,
                    Vauxhall, and Waterloo; Middlesex Hospital; St George’s Hospital; Jews’
                    Hospital; and Harrow School. The number of other erections, of a second and
                    third order, are too numerous for recapitulation.</p>
                <p part="N">The changes of property have been so rapid in this county, and the taste
                    for substituting fashionable novelty in the room of venerable antiquity has been
                    so prevalent, that very few first-rate seats are to be found, but a vast number
                    of second and third-rate houses, which, if removed from the vicinity of the
                    metropolis, would attract considerable notice. The most remarkable residences
                    are, Bently Priory, Marquis of Abercorn; Bushy Park, the residence of his
                    present majesty when Duke of Clarence; Caenwood, Earl of Mansfield; Chiswick
                    House, Duke of Devonshire; Fulham Palace, Bishop of London; Holland House, Lord
