                    formation, he obtained a sub-lieutenancy in the eleventh regiment of <hi
                        rend="italic">chasseurs à cheval.</hi> Here he showed himself a furious
                    revolutionist, and in consequence obtained rapid promotion. He was already
                    lieutenant-colonel, and one of the most fervent adherents of Marat, when, upon
                    the death of that ferocious tribune of the people, he wrote from Abbeville,
                    where he was then in garrison, requesting the society of the Jacobins at Paris
                    to grant him permission to change his name into that of Marat. It is not known
                    whether his request was positively complied with; but it is certain that, after
                    the fall of Robespierre, he was, like Bonaparte, dismissed as a terrorist, and,
                    like him also, found himself at Paris, nearly without resources, in expectation
                    of some change which might prove favourable to his prospects. Nor were his hopes
                    in this respect disappointed. Being restored to his rank at the epoch of the
                    13th Vendémiaire (5th October 1795), he served under the orders of Bonaparte,
                    when the latter was employed to disperse the Parisians who had armed against the
                    Convention. Attaching himself more and more to this young general, Murat showed
                    much intelligence and bravery at the opening of the campaign of Italy in 1796,
                    and became the confidential aide-de-camp of Bonaparte. In consequence of a
                    mission to the court of Turin, which had made overtures of peace, he set out for
                    Paris with despatches relative to the négociations; and, in the month of June,
                    he accompanied Faypoult to Genoa, with instructions to demand of the doge the
                    expulsion of the imperial minister. On his return to the army, Murat directed
                    several attacks with success; and during all that campaign, and the subsequent
                    one of 1797, he signalised himself by his bravery. In March 1798, he proceeded
                    at the head of a column to the confines of the Valteline, and united that
                    province to the new Cisalpine republic. He likewise preceded Bonaparte when,
                    after the peace of Campo Formio, that general traversed Switzerland and Alsace
                    on his way to Rastadt. Being sent to Rome with Berthier, he marched against the
                    insurgents of Marino, Albano, and Castello, killed a great many of them, and
                    caused to be arrested a considerable number of monks and prelates, reputed
                    eneínies of France. When the expedition to Egypt had been resolved on, he
                    declared, that being attached by gratitude to Bonaparte, he would follow him
                    through the world; in fact, he never quitted his chief, and throughout the whole
                    course of that expedition distinguished himself, particularly at Mount Tabor,
                    where, by a series of brilliant charges, he completed the dispersion of the
                    Turkish army, and was rewarded with the rank of general of division. On his
                    return to France with Napoleon, Murat rendered him effectual service at
                    Saint-Cloud, when he changed the form of the government, and took possession of
                    power. It was Murat who, at the head of sixty grenadiers, dispersed the Council
                    of Five Hundred. He was immediately named commandant of the consular guard, and
                    henceforth enjoyed unlimited favour. To draw still closer the ties which united
                    them, Napoleon<pb break="no" facs="nls:193826944?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0715-6944-0595"/> gave Murat his sister Caroline in marriage.
                    He also employed him as one of his lieutenants in the army of reserve, and in
                    this capacity Murat entered Milan, occupied Piacenza, and commanded the cavalry
                    at the battle of Marengo. In the following year he commanded the army of
                    observation, and, along with Micheroux, signed at Foligno an armistice between
                    the French government and the king of the Two Sicilies. He then governed, with
                    the title of general, the Cisalpine republic, and repaired to the <hi
                        rend="italic">Consulta</hi> at Lyons, in virtue of which he installed the
                    new authorities in 1802. On the 1st of January 1804, he was appointed governor
                    of Paris, with the rank of general-in-chief, and directed the military force
                    when Napoleon was proclaimed emperor. A&gt; few days after this event, he was
                    elevated to the rank of marshal of the empire, and in the following year he was
                    raised tö the dignity of prince and of high admiral.</p>
                <p part="N">On the breaking out of hostilities with Austria in 1806, he passed the
                    Rhine at Kehl with the reserve of cavalry, advanced into Suabia, and, at the
                    moment of the capture of Ulm and the capitulation of Mack, pursued vigorously
                    the Austrian corps under the orders of the Archduke Ferdinand, in their retreat
                    through Franconia towards Bohemia. Having overtaken the corps of Werneck, he
                    forced it to lay down its arms, and, taking the road to Vienna, entered that
                    capital on the 11th of November. He then marched against the Russians in
                    Moravia, and by different charges of cavalry contributed to the victory of
                    Austerlitz. Being invested with the grand duchy of Berg, he assumed the style of
                    a sovereign; figured in the two subsequent campaigns, particularly at the battle
                    of lena; made his public entry into Warsaw on the 28th of November 1807; and
                    commanded the cavalry at the battle of Eylau, and also at that of Friedland.</p>
                <p part="N">In April 1808, he entered Spain at the head of a numerous army, and
                    employed all sorts of artifices to exasperate the differences which already
                    existed in the royal family. Having, by a mixture of intimidation and cajolery,
                    induced them to set out for Bayonne, where Napoleon waited to receive them, he
                    provoked an insurrection in the capital, which, though speedily extinguished,
                    spread the flame of discontent throughout the whole of Spain, and gave the first
                    impulse to that spirit of resistance which, encouraged and supported by Britain,
                    ultimately effected the deliverance of the Peninsula. Being recalled from Spain,
                    where his imprudence had proved so detrimental to the interests of his master,
                    he was, on the 1st of August 1808, proclaimed king of the Two Sicilies, under
                    the name of Joachim-Napoleon. As he succeeded Joseph Bonaparte, whom the
                    Neapolitans despised, the comparison was to his advantage; whilst, by the pomp
                    he displayed, and his martial air and bearing, he won the favour of the people,
                    who are always ready to be caught by appearances. The invasion of Russia in 1812
                    recalled him under the banners of his former master. Being placed at the head of
                    the cavalry, he took part in all the operations which preceded the capture of
                    Moscow; he also commanded a separate corps at Kaluga, where at first he obtained
                    some advantages, but subsequently experienced great reverses; and after the
                    departure of Napoleon from the army, he ’ was intrusted with the command of it
                    in its disastrous retreat from Smorgoni. Fatigued and discontented, however, he
                    also abandoned the army, and took the road to Naples, in the hope of yet
                    supporting a throne which seemed destined to crumble into pieces along with the
                    colossal fabric of the French empire. His whole subsequent conduct betrays the
                    inherent weakness and instability of his character. On his return to his
                    capital, he made overtures to the court of Vienna, with a view to the formation
                    of an alliance with Austria; but the campaign of 1813 soon afterwards opened;
                    and as the first events proved favourable to Napoleon, Murat quitted Naples, and
                    once more repaired to the headquarters of the French army,'though with less zeal
                    and parade than formerly, and as if constrained to appear there. After the loss
                    of the battle of Léipzig, he withdrew to his states, and, considering the star
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">î</hi> of Napoleon as for ever eclipsed, he opened his
                    ports to the English, and renewed the négociations for the accession of Naples
                    to the European alliance against France. As the price of this defection, he
                    obtained the recognition of his political existence and of his right of conquest
                    to the city of Ancona and the pontifical marches; but his sincerity was justly
                    doubted by the allies, whom he had joined from necessity, whilst Napoleon
                    naturally reproached him with conduct at variance with every principle of
                    loyalty and gratitude.</p>
                <p part="N">It is unnecessary to give details of bis subsequent proceedings, the
                    account of which belongs properly to the history of the country at the head of
                    which the fortune of war and of conquest had placed him. Though brave as a lion
                    in the field of battle, he showed himself one of the weakest of men when not in
                    presence of the enemy. He had no moral courage. His title of king had turned his
                    head, and he incurred the double reproach of treachery and ingratitude, without
                    deriving the slightest advantage from his dereliction of principle. His invasion
                    of Italy after the return of Napoleon from Elba was in every view a most
                    headlong and irrational proceeding, inasmuch as all the chances were against
                    him, and defeat was certain to be followed by destruction. After the failure of
                    this absurd attempt, he lived for some time in retirement at Plaisance, a
                    country-house near Toulon, where he first learned the tidings of the battle of
                    Waterloo. The news of this disaster sounded as the deathknell of all his hopes.
                    In the space of two months, he had lost his army, his fleet, part of his
                    treasures, bis crown, and even his field equipage; and now, after the second
                    abdication of the man in whose fortune alone he could repose any hope for the
                    future, all seemed irrecoverably lost. He escaped to the island of Corsica,
                    where he had many partizans, and began to form new projects. An asylum was
                    offered him in Bohemia, Moravia, or Austria, on condition of his renouncing the
                    title of king, submitting to the laws of the country, and consenting not to quit
                    his residence without the permission of the emperor. But having resolved to make
                    an attempt to recover his power by effecting a landing in Italy, he sailed from
                    Corsica on the 28th of September 1815, with seven transports, containing 250
                    men, and, on the 8th of October, reached the Gulf of St Euphemia, where one only
                    of his barks had rejoined him, the rest being separated in a gale of wind. When
                    he landed at Pizzo, he was accompanied by only thirty men, and knew not what
                    course to follow. To wait for the other barks, or to make an attempt to raise
                    the country, seemed equally dangerous. He at length decided in favour of the
                    latter course; but all his efforts were vain. The inhabitants flew to arms, and
                    attacked his troop, upon which the two small vessels immediately stood out to
                    sea. Murat attempted to launch a fishing-boat which he found upon the beach; but
                    the task exceeded his strength, and escape was impossible. Having been made
                    prisoner, he was lodged in the castle of Pizzo, tried by a military commission,
                    condemned, and sentenced to be shot. The judgment of the court was carried into
                    execution on the 13th of October, when this singular man, whom death had spared
                    in a hundred battles, fell ingloriously in an obscure town of Calabria, the
                    victim of his own folly and ambition. He appears to have died in a manner worthy
                    of his reputation for courage. He refused to allow his eyes to be bandaged, saw
                    the arms charged, placed himself so as to receive the concentrated fire of the
                    soldiers, and, exclaiming “Sauvez le visage, visez au coeur,” instantly fell
                    dead under the discharge. Murat perished in the forty-eighth year of his age,
                    after <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826957?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0715-6957-0596"/>having experienced every variety of fortune;
                    indeed he was a man whose destiny mây, in some respects, be considered as the
                    most extraordinary in modern times. Sprung from the lowest class of society, and
                    raised to supreme rank, his elevation was the more surprising that he had
                    neither the great qualities nor the great vices which seem to command events.
                    Fortune had so blinded him, that he neither perceived the inevitable dangers
                    with which the fall of Bonaparte and the restoration of the Bourbons had
                    surrounded him, nor could he turn to account the resources which circumstances
                    still placed in his power. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
