                    included by Linnaeus, and the older systematic writers, in the order <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Aptera.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The Myriapoda are distinguished from true insects by their greater
                    amount of feet (twenty-four and upwards), by the want of any precise or
                    appreciable division into thorax and abdomen, and by the numerous segments into
                    which their bodies are divided. Each segment, with the exception of the first,
                    is furnished with a pair of legs, terminated for the most part by a single hook.
                    The stigmata, or openings for respiration, are placed on each alternate segment,
                    a circumstance which has induced some observers to regard the latter as only
                    semi-segments, in as far as in true insects each ring has its pair of stigmata.
                    But we see no necessity for the establishment of any strict analogy of form
                    between the subjects of two distinct classes of articulated beings; and indeed,
                    if we do so in regard to the character in question, we produce a greater
                    discordance by the necessity, in that case, of assigning to each so-called
                    (double) segment, a couple of pair of legs. The mandibles are bi-articulate, and
                    are followed by a piece in the form of a labium, quadrifid, with articulated
                    divisions resembling little feet, and corresponding in position to the <hi
                        rend="italic">languette</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Crustacea. Then
                    succeed two pair of small feet, of which the second, sometimes hook-shaped, seem
                    to replace the four maxillae of the last-named order, or the two maxillae and
                    the lower lip of insects. They may be regarded as maxillary feet. The antennae
                    are two in number. Their form cannot be easily generalised, because, although
                    they may often be, as Latrei∏e says, “courtes, un peu plus grosses vers le bout,
                    ou presque filiformes yet in some (genus <hi rend="italic">Scutigera)</hi> they
                    are very long, and become much more slender towards the extremity. The number of
                    the articulations also varies greatly. The organs of vision are usually formed
                    by a union of smooth or simple eyes; but in some these parts are analogous to
                    the compound eyes of insects, the facettes, however, being proportionally
                    larger, rounder, and more distinct. All Myriapodes are apterous.</p>
                <p part="N">The subjects of our present notice differ likewise from insects in this
                    remarkable peculiarity, that the number of their segments, and consequently of
                    the stigmata and legs, increases with the size of the individual. It would even
                    appear, from the observations of Savi the younger,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"><hi rend="italic">» Memorie
                                Scientijiche,</hi> Pisa, 1828.</p></note> that the genus <hi
                        rend="italic">lulus</hi> is born without feet; from which it has been
                    observed, that those Myriapodes are subject, at some early period of their
                    lives, to a regular metamorphosis. Degeer had long before observed, that the
                    number of their parts increased with the general growth of the body.</p>
                <p part="N">The organs of respiration consist of two principal tracheae extending
                    parallel along the body, and receiving air from the lateral spiracles.</p>
                <p part="N">Myriapodes are generally supposed to be longer lived, and of more
                    continuous growth, than insects; and, according to Savi the younger, two years
                    elapse (at least in the genus <hi rend="italic">lulus)</hi> before the
                    development of the generative system; but it must be borne in mind, that many
                    insects exist for a length of time in the larva state (to which the early
                    condition of the Myriapodes so closely corresponds), and are thus of equal
                    longevity with the many-footed subjects of our present inquiry. The Myriapodes
                    in general shun the light. They conceal themselves under stones, beneath the
                    bark of trees, among old timber, and in various other localities. Some inhabit
                    fruits, and others are destructive to culinary vegetables. Many are carnivorous,
                    seizing upon animal substances, both dead and living, with their curved jaws.
                    They are said to infuse a poisonous juice into their wounded victims.</p>
                <p part="N">In our subdivision of the class, as in the preceding generalities, we
                    shall follow the system of Latreille, by whom the Myriapodes are partitioned
                    into two primary groups, which differ from each other both in habits and
                    structure.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Order</hi> L—CHILOGNATHA.</p>
                <p part="N">This primary group corresponds to the genus <hi rend="italic">lulus</hi>
                    of Linnaeus. The body is for the most part cylindrical, and of a crustaceous
                    consistence. The antennae are composed of seven joints, of nearly equal size.
                    The mandibles are thick, without palpi, distinctly divided into two portions by
                    a median articulation, and with teeth implanted in a concavity of their upper
                    extremity. Beneath is a kind of labium or lower lip, divided at its exterior
                    surface, by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827698?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0715-7698-0653"/>notches and longitudinal sections, into four
                    principal areas, tuberculated on the upper margin, and of which the two
                    intermediate are short and narrow, and placed at the upper extremity of another
                    area, which serves them as a common base. The feet are very short, and always
                    terminate in a single hook; four anterior feet placed immediately beneath the
                    labium, resemble the others in form, but are more approximate at their base,
                    with the radical joint proportionally longer. Most of the other legs are
                    attached by double pairs to a single segment of the body. The male organs are
                    placed beneath the seventh pair of legs, those of the female behind the second
                    pair. The stigmata, as usually described, are very small, and placed on
                    alternate segments outside the origin of the legs.</p>
                <p part="N">The Myriapodes of this division are slow of movement, and advance, as it
                    were, by a gliding motion. They assume in defence a round or spiral form. The
                    first segment of the body, in some the second, is larger than the others, and
                    presents the form of a corselet or buckler. The double pairs of legs do not
                    occur until we reach the fourth, fifth, or sixth pair; the first three or four
                    pair being free from their origin, or adhering to their respective segments only
                    by a median or sternal line. The*two or three terminal segments of the body are
                    usually without feet. On each side of the body there is a series of pores,
                    formerly regarded as stigmata, but which, according to Μ. Savi, merely emit.an
                    acid liquor of a disagreeable odour, and probably intended as a means of
                    defence; the true stigmata, or respiratory openings, as described by the Italian
                    naturalist, being placed on the sternal piece of each segment, and communicating
                    internally with a double series of pneumatic pouches, disposed <hi rend="italic"
                        >en chapelet</hi> along the body, and giving out tracheal branches, which
                    ramify over the other organs. These pouches or vesicular tracheae, according to
                    Μ. Straus, are not connected with each other, as among ordinary insects, by a
                    principal trachea.</p>
                <p part="N">The form of the newly-hatched bodies of the lulidae, as observed by Μ.
                    Savi in the vicinity of Pisa, was somewhat kidney-shaped, quite plain, and
                    without appendages. After the lapse of eighteen days they underwent their first
                    moult, and only then assumed the form of the adults; but they were still
                    composed of only twenty-two segments, and the total number of their legs
                    amounted to twenty-six pair. These observations are in some measure inconsistent
                    with the assertion of Degeer, who in the young state of these creatures counted
                    only three pair of legs and eight segments: but is it certain, asks Μ.
                    Latreille, that the moult described by Μ. Savi was actually the first; or ought
                    we not rather to presume that they do not pass suddenly from an apodal state to
                    the possession of twenty-six pair of legs; in other words, that they are subject
                    to certain intermediate changes, which may have escaped the observance of Μ.

                    informs us, the genus <hi rend="italic">lulus</hi> exhibits thirty-six pair of
                    legs, and after the third, forty-three, and the body then consists of thirty
                    segments. In the adult state the number is considerably increased. Two years
                    afterwards another moult takes place, and it is only then that the generative
                    system is developed. From the period of birth, which takes place in March, the
                    renewals of the skin were observed by Μ. Savi to take place almost monthly till
                    November, and the exuviae were seen to contain even the membrane which lines the
                    interior of the alimentary canal and tracheae. The organs of the mouth were the
                    only parts not there observed by Μ. Savi.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    naturalist. The antennae become slender towards the extremity, and are composed
                    of fourteen articulations and upwards. The mouth is composed of two mandibles,
                    each furnished with a small palpiform appendage, and exhibiting in their centre
                    the appearance of a joining, and ending in a spoon-shaped termination, with

                    than the others, transversely ringed, and resembling the membranous feet of

                    kinds, which represents in Latreille’s opinion the tongue of the crustaceous
                    tribes, but possesses also the functions of maxillae. It is what Savigný names
                    the first auxiliary lip. Besides these parts, there are two palpi or minute
                    feet, united at the base, and unguiculated at the point; a second labium <hi

                    joined at their origin, and terminated by a strong hook, moveable, and pierced
                    at the extremity, for the transmission of a venomous or acrid liquid.</p>
                <p part="N">The body of these unseemly creatures is depressed and membranous. Each
                    ring or segment is covered by a coriaceous plate, and usually bears only a
                    single pair of legs; and the terminal segment is generally thrown backwards, and
                    elongated into a kind of tail. The organs of respiration are composed, either in
                    whole or in part, of tubular tracheae. The sexual parts are interior, and placed
                    at the posterior extremity of the body, as in the generality of insects properly
                    so called. The stigmata are more obvious than in the preceding family, and are
                    either lateral or dorsal.</p>
                <p part="N">The species of this division are of much more nimble habits than those
                    of the preceding; and the peculiar mode in which the limbs act produces an
                    undulating lateral motion. They are of carnivorous habits, and, avoiding strong
                    light, usually conceal themselves under stones or old timber, beneath the bark
                    of trees, &amp;c. They are held in some dread by the inhabitants of tropical
                    countries, where they attain a great size, and are consequently capable of
                    inflicting dangerous wounds. But the majority of travellers seem agreed that,
                    although the bite is more painful than that of a scorpion, it is never attended
                    by fatal consequences. In more northern countries they are quite harmless,
                    though disliked in consequence of their repulsive aspect. Our common centipede
                        <hi rend="italic">(Scolopendra forfi-cata</hi> of Linn.) so frequent in this
                    country under stones, may be mentioned as a familiar example. Leeuwenhoeck, the
                    great Dutch microscopical observer, has described the perforation of the hooks,
                    through which the poison is supposed to flow.</p>

                    the following genera.</p>
                <p part="N">The first two have only fifteen pair of legs; and their bodies, when

                    inferior tracheae of a tubular form. The under surface is divided into fifteen
                    semi-segments, each bearing a pair of feet terminated by an extremely long,
                    slender, and minutely articulated tarsus. The terminal legs are long, and seem
                    to increase in extent from the foremost to the hindmost pair. The eyes are
                    comparatively large and reticulated. The antennae are very long and slender, and

                    unfrequented parts of houses, lying between old planks, or sometimes under
                    stones. They are seen at night running on the outside walls with great velocity,
                    feeding on <hi rend="italic">onisci,</hi> and various insects. They seem to
                    pierce their prey with their mouth-hooks, and infuse into them a poisonous
                    fluid, which immediately deprives them of life. These Myriapodes make their
                    appearance in great numbers, chiefly in rainy weather. According to liliger,
                    they are greatly dreaded by the inhabitants of Hungary. The best known European
