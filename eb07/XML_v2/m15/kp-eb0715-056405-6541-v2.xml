                    the Israelites by Moses. This is the most remarkable system of jurisprudence
                    ever given to the world, as well as the most ancient of which we have any
                    distinct record. It was delivered, not to a settled nation, but to a people on
                    their way to a settlement at that time inhabited by numerous and powerful clans,
                    from whom, and from all other nations whatsoever, it was one of the main objects
                    of the law to separate and distinguish them; and when they had reached the
                    promised land, it was, with scarcely any alteration, found equally adapted to
                    the people after they had subjugated the hostile bands by which they were
                    surrounded, and were living in victorious peace amidst the trade and bustle, the
                    pomp and magnificence, ofa great monarchy. Nor is this all. Its decalogue, or
                    ten commandments, has been adopted by the most enlightened nations as the moral
                    law of human nature. These precepts, too, were not promulgated at different

                    age, but were given at once, along with the other principles of the system;
                    which exhibits a unity of character and a singleness of purpose peculiar to
                    itself. It must be added, that throughout the whole code there evidently appears
                    an end and object, which, like the vital fluid meandering in our veins, imparts
                    to the system all its freshness, life, and vigour, and which being withdrawn or
                    accomplished, the body is left in the weakness and stillness of death.</p>
                <p part="N">The Mosaic or Jewish law is generally said to be comprehended in these
                    three particulars; namely, the decalogue, or ten commandments, the judicial law,
                    and the ordinances of divine service, or the ceremonial law. But it was
                    certainly not so considered by the Jews themselves, nor by their lawgiver. The
                    basis upon which the whole law rested was historical. It was this: That God had
                    chosen the progenitor of the nation from amongst his idolatrous kinsmen, to
                    impart to him and his posterity a knowledge of the true God, and establish them
                    in the land to which the nation was now advancing, to be there governed by this
                    law. The very first words of the decalogue are, “I am the Lord thy God, which
                    brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; thou shalt
                    have no other Gods before me.” And, with the eye of faith, the believing Jew
                    could look forward to the distant future, and anticipate the time when there
                    should “come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch grow out of his
                    roots,”—</p>

                    the whole Jewish judges, magistrates, and officers, were merely his deputies, to
                    announce to the people, or execute upon them, the divine promises and

                    rest for all persons and for all cattle within the Jewish territory, to restore
                    them after their previous toils, and, at the same time, to keepalive in the

                    of his father’s goods. On failure of children, the estate fell to the brothers
                    of the deceased, next to his father’s brothers, and, lastly, to the nearest
                    kinsman of the family.</p>

                    Hebrew law of interest. For by the regulation disallowing interest, coupled with
                    the regulation, to be immediately noticed, that debts were released at the
                    Sabbatical year, the loan of money was made difficult of attainment, and so the

                    Leviticus, xxv. 23: “The land shall not be sold for ever, for it is mine, saith
                    the Lord; and ye are strangers and sojourners with me.”</p>

                    indeed, was, as we have seen, one of the first principles of the law; and in the
                    appointment of the Sabbath the Jew was continually reminded of the divine
                    compassion towards even the beasts of the field, who had thus secured to them a
                    weekly intermission from their labours. Mercy was to be shown to every Jew, as
                    to “a brother,” and whether he were a friend or a foe; and all oppression was
                    forbidden towards strangers, for, says the divine lawgiver, “ye were strangers
                    in the land of Egypt, and know the heart of a stranger ;”<note anchored="true"

                    towards the widow and fatherless, for “if thou afflict them in any wise, and

                    first notice which we have of this is in the judicial law, where it is said, “ye

                    that, amongst other things, certain animals, beasts, fishes, fowls, and
                    reptiles, were unclean. The defilement contracted was sometimes but temporary,
                    and ceased with the morning’s ablution; at other times it could be removed only
                    in the way prescribed by the law.</p>
                <p part="N">There were also certain persons, places, and times, which were accounted
                    peculiarly holy. The holy place <hi rend="italic">par excellence was</hi> the
                    tabernacle, the outer court of which occupied a space of one hundred cubits in
                    length by fifty in breadth, or about one hundred and eighty feet by ninety. The
                    only entrance to this court was from the east by a hanging rail of blue, purple,
                    scarlet, and fine-twined linen. Here, under the open sky, stood a laver of brass
                    for the priests to wash in, and the altar of burnt-offering. Into this court
                    every clean Hebrew or proselyte of the covenant might enter with his offerings.
                    At the west end of this court stood a close tent about fifty-four feet in length
                    by eighteen in breadth, which was properly called the tabernacle, and divided
                    into two apartments. The first, which St Paul calls the <hi rend="italic"
                        >first</hi> tabernacle, was about thirty-six feet in length, and contained
                    the shew-bread, the candlestick of pure gold, &amp;c.; and into this, which was
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">the holy place,</hi> only the priests durst enter
                    or look. Beyond this apartment was another about eighteen feet square, called
                    the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> tabernacle, most holy place, or Holy of
                    Holies, which was separated from the first tabernacle by a veil of embroidered
                    linen hung upon pillars of wood overlaid with gold. Here stood the ark of the
                    covenant. It was made of wood overlaid with gold, and contained the book of the
                    testimony. Upon the ark, and of like dimensions with it, was the mercy-seat, of
                    pure gold, with a cherub of beaten gold on either side, stretching its wings
                    over the mercyseat, the face of the cherubim being towards each other. It was
                    from above the mercy-seat, and between the cherubim, that God met and communed
                    with Moses and the high priest; none else was permitted to enter the sacred
                    precincts, and even the high priest could only do so once a year, and this not
                    without blood, which he offered for himself and for the errors of the
                    people.</p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">priesthood</hi> was in the family of Aaron. The
                    priests served at the altar, prepared the victims, and offered the sacrifices;
                    they kept up the fire upon the altar of burnt-offerings, and in the lamps of the
                    golden candlesticks; they kneaded, baked, and offered the shew-bread; they
                    publicly blessed the people, and were consulted by them as the interpreters of
                    the law, and judges of controversies; and, in time of war, they carried the ark
                    and sounded the trumpets. Their garments, which were specially prescribed in the
                    law, were a tiara, a girdle, a linen tunic, and linen drawers. The high priest
                    had a plate or crown of gold an his tiara, with the inscription, “Holiness to
                    the Lord.” He had also the square breastplate of judgment, with its twelve
                    stones containing the names of the twelve tribes, and the Urim and Thummim fixed
                    in the breastplate; the ephod having on the shoulders two onyx stones, whereon
                    were also engraved the names of the children of Israel; the blue robe of the
                    ephod with golden bells hung to the skirt to sound when the high priest walked
                    in and out from the holy place; and, lastly, the high priest’s coat.</p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">Levites,</hi> who were consecrated to God, instead
                    of the first-born of the nation, were assigned to the priests, to wait upon
                    them, to serve the tabernacle, to carry it, to encamp round it, and to minister
                    in relation to it. They were divided into three classes, from the three sons of
                    Levi, <hi rend="italic">Gershon, Kohatk,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Merari,</hi>
                    each of which had its own particular charge. The charge of one class was the
                    tabernacle, and its coverings and hangings; that of another was the boards of
                    the tabernacle, its bars, pillars, and sockets; and that of the third was to
                    bear “the most holy things,” that is to say, the sanctuary or most holy place,
                    and all the vessels and articles appertaining to it. But these were not to be
                    touched by them; they were to be taken down and put up by the priests, and
                    simply carried under cover by the bearers, and this upon their shoulders;
                    whereas the other two classes of the Levites had, the one two waggons and four
                    oxen, and the other four waggons and eight oxen, for their service.</p>
                <p part="N">And as the Levites were appointed to assist the priests, so Moses was
                    allowed seventy elders of Israel “to bear the burden of the people with
                    him.”</p>
                <p part="N">The holy <hi rend="italic">Festivals</hi> were the weekly Sabbath and
                    the three great annual feasts, namely, 1. the Passover and feast of Unleavened

                    feast of Tabernacles, or the gathering in of the corn and wine. The Passover was
                    observed on the fourteenth day of the first month of the Jewish year, which
                    began in March; and the feast of Unleavened Bread lasted the seven following
                    days. The feast of Weeks was a moveable feast. The feast of Tabernacles was in
                    the seventh month, or in our September. On the first day of the month, which was
                    observed as a Sabbath, the trumpets were sounded, whence that day was called the
                    feast of Trumpets. The tenth day, which was likewise Sabbatical, was the great
                    day of Atonement, when every one was required to afflict his soul; and on the
                    fifteenth day the feast of Tabernacles began, and lasted seven days. It was on
                    the great day of Atonement also that the Jubilee was proclaimed every fiftieth
                    year, and then every one returned to his family and possessions, and the land
                    lay fallow for a year. All these feasts and times were specially ordered in the
                    law; and the matter and manner of the sacrifices and offerings then to be made
                    were therein also specially prescribed. There were other sacred seasons, such as
                    the times of new moons; and every day the Temple was open for worship, and
                    sacrifices and offerings were made every morning and evening.</p>
                <p part="N">Besides the stated sacrifices and offerings, free-will offerings were
                    allowed; and to meet particular vows, persons were valued in the law according
                    to their sex and age; but it was specially provided that no devoted thing should
                    be redeemed,—“every devoted thing is most holy unto the Lord.”</p>
                <p part="N">A few words may now be added on the history of this remarkable code. It
                    was promulgated before the Israelites began their journey to Canaan; and they
                    had not proceeded far on their way thither when the authority of Moses was
                    signally vindicated, particularly on two occasions; first, when Miriam the
                    sister of Moses was struck with leprosy for envying and speaking against Moses;
                    and next, when Korah, grandson of Kohath, whose function was to carry “the most
                    holy things,” ambitious of a higher charge, <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193826593?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6593-0568"/>headed a
                    great company, who would have put down all subordination and rank, on the
                    pretence that “all the congregation were holy, every one of them.”<note

                    rebellion, invoked on them the divine vengeance, in consequence of which they
                    all perished. In the time of Joshua, the successor of Moses in the captaincy of
                    Israel, the people were settled in the promised land. From Joshua’s death they
                    had no regular succession of leaders down to the time of Samuel, when they
                    sought a king, and obtained one, first in the person of Saul, and then of David;
                    in whose reign, that is to say, nearly five hundred years after the departure
                    out of Egypt, a permanent Temple was erected at Jerusalem, instead of the former
                    Tabernacle. In their internal arrangements the Temple and Tabernacle were alike,
                    the house of God at Moriah consisting, like the Mosaic Tabernacle, of a porch or
                    court, the temple or sanctuary, and the most holy place, or place of the oracle;
                    but the change of the Tabernacle, which was ambulatory, to a fixed and permanent
                    temple, occasioned the alteration on the Mosaic code to which we alluded in the
                    beginning of this article. There was now no need for the Levites in their
                    capacity of bearers of the tabernacle. King David, therefore, distributed the
                    priests and the Levites into new classes, and appointed treasurers, singers,
                    porters, and other officers. His son Solomon, also, ordered for the temple an
                    immense molten sea, and caldrons for water for the sacrifices; and for himself a
                    throne of ivory overlaid with gold. This was the First Temple; for, at the
                    captivity of the last remaining tribes, it was finally destroyed; and, upon the
                    return of the Jews under Cyrus and Darius, a new temple on the same site was
                    erected, of which it was predicted that its glory should exceed the glory of the
                    former. This was accomplished in the appearance there of the Messiah, the king
                    and priest of a spiritual Israel, who has abolished the distinction between Jew
                    and Gentile, and, having offered up himself as a sacrifice for sin, is gone into
                    heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for his people, till they
                    also be introduced into the same presence as “kings and priests.” (u. u. u.)</p>
