                    likewise between all comparatively smaller bodies, and even between the smallest
                    particles of which they are composed. Agreeably to this hypothesis, a heavy
                    body, which ought to gravitate or tend towards the centre of the earth, in a
                    direction perpendicular to its surface, supposing the said surface to be
                    perfectly even and spherical, ought likewise, though in a less degree, to be
                    attracted and tend towards <hi rend="italic">a</hi> mountain placed upon the
                    earth’s surface; so that the plumb-line, for instance, of a quadrant, hanging in
                    the neighbourhood of such a mountain, ought to be drawn from a perpendicular
                    situation, in consequence of the attractive power of the quantity of matter of
                    which it is composed, acting in a direction different from that exerted by the
                    whole mass of matter in the earth, and with a proportionally inferior degree of
                    force.</p>
                <p part="N">Though Sir Isaac Newton had long ago hinted at an experiment of this
                    kind, and had remarked, that “a mountain of an hemispherical figure, three miles
                    high and six broad, would not, by its attraction, draw the plumb-line two
                    minutes out of the perpendicular j” <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> yet no
                    attempt to ascertain this matter by actual experiment was made till about the
                    year 1738, when the French academicians, particularly MM. Bouguer and Condamine,
                    who were sent to Peru to measure a degree under the equator, attempted to
                    discover the attractive power of Chimboraço, a mountain in the province of
                    Quito. According to their observations, which however were made under
                    circumstances by no means favourable to an accurate solution of so nice and
                    difficult a problem, the mountain of Chimboraço exerted an attraction equal to
                    about eight seconds. Though this experiment was not perhaps sufficient to prove
                    satisfactorily even the reality of an attraction, much less the precise quantity
                    of it, yet it does not appear that any steps have since been taken to repeat
                    it.</p>
                <p part="N">Through the munificence of his Britannic majesty, the Royal Society were
                    enabled to undertake the execution of this delicate and importantexperiment; and
                    the astronomer royal was chosen to conduct it. After various inquiries, the
                    mountain of Schehallien, situated nearly in the centre of Scotland, was pitched
                    upon as the most proper for the purpose that could be found in this island. The
                    observations were made by taking the meridian zenith distances of different
                    fixed stars near the zenith, by means of a zenith sector of ten feet radius;
                    first on the south, and afterwards on the north side of the hill, the greatest
                    length of which extended in an easterly and westerly direction.</p>
                <p part="N">It is evident, that if the mass of matter in the hill exerted any
                    sensible attraction, it would cause the plumb-line of the sector, through which
                    an observer viewed a star in the meridian, to deviate from its perpendicular
                    situation, and would attract it contrariwise at the two stations, thereby
                    doubling the effect. On the south side, the plummet would be drawn to the
                    northward by the attractive power of the hill placed to the northward of it; and
                    on the north side, a contrary and equal deflection of the plumb-line would take
                    place in consequence of the attraction of the hill, now to the southward of it.
                    The apparent zenith distances of the stars would be affected contrariwise; those
                    being increased at the one station which were diminished at the other; and the
                    correspondent quantities of the deflection of the plumb-line would give the
                    observer the sum of the contrary attractions of the hill, acting on the plummet
                    at the two stations; so that the half would of course indicate the attractive
                    power of the hill.</p>
                <p part="N">The various operations requisite for performing this experiment lasted
                    about four months; and from them it appears that the sum of the two contrary
                    attractions of the mountain of Schehallien, in the two temporary observations
                    which were successively made half way up the hill (where the effect of its
                    attraction would be greatest), was equal to H"∙6. From a rough computation,
                    founded on the known law of gravitation, and on an assumption that the density
                    of the hill is equal to the mean density of the earth, it appears that the
                    attraction of the hill should amount to about the double of this quantity. From
                    this it was inferred that the density of the hill is only about half the mean
                    density of the earth. It does not appear, however, that the mountain of
                    Schehallien has ever been a volcano, or is hollow, as it is extremely solid and
                    dense, and seemingly composed of an entire rock. The inferences drawn from these
                    experiments may be reduced to the following.</p>
                <p part="N">1. It appears that the moun tain of Schehallien exerts a sensible
                    attraction; therefore, by the rules of philosophizing, we are warranted to
                    conclude, that every mountain, and indeed every particle of the earth, is
                    endowed with the same property, in proportion to its quantity of matter.</p>
                <p part="N">2. The law of the variation of this force, in the inverse ratio of the
                    squares of the distances, as laid down by Sir Isaac Newton, was also confirmed
                    by this experiment. For if the force of attraction of the hill had been only to
                    that of the earth, as the matter in the hill to that of the earth, and had not
                    been greatly increased by the near approach to its centre, the attraction
                    thereof must have been wholly insensible. But now, by only supposing the mean
                    density of the earth to be double that of the hill, which seems very probable
                    from other considerations, the attraction of the hill will be reconciled to the
                    general law of the variation of attraction in the inverse duplicate ratio of the
                    distances, as deduced by Sir Isaac Newton from the comparison of the motion of
                    the heavenly bodies with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth; and
                    the analogy of nature will be preserved.</p>
                <p part="N">3. We may now, therefore, be allowed to admit this law, and to
                    acknowledge that the mean density of the earth is at least double of that at the
                    surface, and consequently that the density of the internal parts of the earth
                        <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> By a very easy calculation, it is found that
                    such a mountain would attract the plumb-line 1' 18" from the perpendicular.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826801?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6801-0584"/>
                <p part="N">is much greater than near the surface. Hence, also, the whole quantity
                    of matter in the earth will be at least as great again as if it bad been all
                    composed of matter of the same density with that at the surface, or will be
                    about four or five times as great as if it were all composed of water. This
                    conclusion, Dr Maskelyne adds, is totally contrary to the hypothesis of some
                    naturalists, “who suppose the earth to be only a great hollow shell of matter,
                    supporting itself from the property of an arch, with an immense vacuity in the
                    midst of it.” But were that the case, the attraction of mountains, and even
                    smaller inequalities in the earth’s surface, would, contrary to experiment, be
                    very great, and would affect the measures of the degrees of the meridian much
                    more than we find they do; and the variation of gravity, in different latitudes,
                    in going from the equator to the poles, as found by pendulums, would not be near
                    so regular as it has been found by experiment to be.</p>
                <p part="N">4. As mountains are by these experiments found capable of producing
                    sensible deflections of the plumb-lines of astronomical instruments, it becomes
                    a matter of great importance, in the mensuration of degrees in the meridian,
                    either to choose places where the irregular attraction of the elevated parts may
                    be small; or where, by their situation, they may compensate or counteract the
                    effectsof each other.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Mountain</hi><hi rend="italic">of Forty Days,</hi>
                    a mountain of Judaea, situated in the plain of Jericho, to the north of that
                    city. According to the Abbé Mariti’s description, the summit of it is covered
                    neither with shrubs, nor turf, nor earth; it consists of a solid mass of white
                    marble, the surface of which has become yellow by the injuries of the air. « The
                    path by which you ascend to it,” says this writer, “fills one with terror, as it
                    rises with a winding course between two abysses, which the eye dares scarcely
                    behold. This path is at first pretty broad, but it at length becomes so
                    confined, that one can with difficulty place both feet upon it at the same time.
                    When we had ascended a little higher, we found an Arab stretched out on the
                    path, who made us pay a certain toll for our passage. Here the traveller
                    requires courage. One of the parapets of the path being broken, we clung to the
                    part which remained until we had reached a small grotto, situated very
                    commodiously, as it gave us an opportunity of recovering our breath. When we had
                    rested ourselves a little, we pursued our course, which became still more
                    dangerous. Suspended almost from the rock, and having before our eyes all the
                    horror of the precipice, we could advance only by dragging one foot after the
                    other; so that had the smallest fragments given way under us, we should have
                    been hurried to the bottom of this frightful abyss.</p>
                <p part="N">“This mountain is one of the highest in the province, and one of its
                    most sacred places. It takes its name from the rigorous fast which Christ
                    observed here after having triumphed over the vanities of the world and the
                    power of hell. In remembrance of this miracle, a chapel was formerly constructed
                    on the summit of the mountain. It may be seen from the plain, but we could not
                    approach it, as the path was almost entirely destroyed. It, however, may be
                    accessible on the other side of the mountain, which we did not visit. A great
                    many scattered grottos are seen here; in one of which, according to Q,uaresmius,
                    were deposited the bodies of several anchorets, which are still entire. I have
                    heard the same thing asserted in the country, but I could never meet with any
                    person who had seen them. Here we enjoyed the most beautiful prospect
                    imaginable. This part of the Mountain of Forty Days overlooks the mountains of
                    Arabia, the country of Gilead, the country of the Ammonites, the plains of Moab,
                    the plain of Jericho, the river Jordan, and the whole extent of the Dead Sea. It
                    was here that the devil said to the Son of God, ‘ All these kingdoms will I give
                    thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.’”</p>
