                    a great noise; and being translated into Latin, instantly spread throughout
                    Europe, and gained him a prodigious reputation. It <hi rend="subscript">

                    others, with much more reason, have applauded the piety, as well as the parts
                    and learning, of the author. His Treatise on</p>
                <p part="N">Vulgar Errors was read with equal avidity; he also published <hi

                    found in Norfolk. His reputation in his profession was equal to his fame for
                    learning in other respeets; and therefore the college of ptyysieians were
                    pleased to take him into their number as an honorary member; and King Charles
                    II. eoming to Norwich in his progress in 1671, was pleased to knight him, with
                    singular marks of favour and respect. He died on his birthday in 1681, leaving
                    several manuscripts behind him, whieh were published under the title of The
                    Posthumous Works of the learned Sir Thomas Browne, Knt. Μ. D.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Browne,</hi><hi rend="italic">Edward,</hi> the son
                    of the former, physieian to King Charles II. and president of the Royal College
                    of London. He was born in the year 1642; and studied at Cambridge, and
                    afterwards at Merton College, Oxford. He then travelled; and on his return
                    published a brief aecount of some travels in Hungary, Servia, Bulgaria,
                    Macedonia, Thessaly, Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, Friuli, and other
                    parts. He also published an account of several travels through great part of
                    Germany, and joined his name to those of many other eminent men in a translation
                    of Plutarch’s Lives. He was acquainted with Hebrew, was a critic in Greek, and
                    no man of his age wrote better Latin. High Dutch, Italian, Freneb, and other
                    modern languages, he spoke and wrote with as much ease as his mother tongue.
                    King Charles said of him, that he was as learned as any of the eollege, and as
                    well bred as any at court. He died on the 27th August 1708.</p>

                    This eminent traveller was born on Great-Tower-Hill, London, on the 25th July
                    1768. His father was a respcetable wine merchant, cle-seended from a good family
                    in Cumberland. His constitution being originally so weak as to require constant
                    attention, he was educated privately under Dr Whalley, editor of Ben Jonson’s
                    works, a man of considerable parts and learning, who inspired him with a taste
                    for study. At seventeen he was sent to Oriel College, Oxford; and, though he
                    complained of the want of encouragement and assistance, he there went through an
                    extensive course of classical reading, studying often from twelve to fifteen
                    hours a day. On leaving the university lie hesitated for some time between the
                    three learned professions, but at length determined to remain eontented with the
                    moderate competence left to him by his father, and applied himself entirely to
                    the pursuit of knowledge. He embarked deeply in political questions, embracing
                    with ardour the popular cause. He republished some political tracts, among whieh
                    was part of Buehanan, <hi rend="italic">J)e Jure</hi><hi rend="italic">Regni
                        apud Scotos,</hi> and formed the plan of reprinting a regular series of such
                    writings. But the fame of Mr Bruce’s travels, and of the first discoveries made
                    by the African Association, inflamed his ardent mind, and he determined to
                    devote himself to the eausc of discovery on that continent.</p>
                <p part="N">Mr Browne left England at the elose of 1791, and arrived at Alexandria
                    in January 1792. He spent a few months in visiting Siwah, the supposed site of
                    the temple of Jupiter Ammon; and employed the remainder of the year in examining
                    the whole of Egypt. In the spring of 1793 he visited Suez and Sinai, and in May
                    set out for Darfur. This was his most important journey, in which he acquired a
                    great variety of original information. He endured much hardship, and was unable
                    to effect his purpose of returning by Abyssinia. He did not reach Egypt till
                    1796, after which he spent a year in Syria, and did not arrive in London till
                    September 1798. In 1800 he published his travels in Africa, Egypt, and Syria,
                    from the year 1792 to 1798, in one volume 4to. The work was highly esteemed, and
                    is classed by Major Rennell among the first performances of the kind; but, from
                    the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193740915?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0705-0915-0604"/>abruptness and dryness of the style, it never
                    became very popular.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1800 Mr Brown again left England, and spent three years in visiting
                    Greece, some parts of Asia Minor, and Sicily. He had made some progress in
                    preparing for the press an account of this journey, but gave up his intention,
                    for some reason unknown.</p>
                <p part="N">Mr Browne now spent some years in retirement, employed in oriental
                    studies, and showing indifference to British objects and scenery, though he
                    enjoyed greatly an excursion into Ireland.</p>
                <p part="N">Tired of this inactivity, in 1812 he set out on a more extensive journey
                    than formerly, proposing to penetrate to Samarcand, and survey the most
                    interesting regions of Central Asia. He spent the winter in Smyrna, and in the
                    spring of 1813 proceeded through Asia Minor and Armenia, made a short stay at
                    Erzerum, and arrived on the first of June at Tabriz, where he met with Sir Gore
                    Ouseley. About the end of the summer of 1813 he left Tabriz for Teheran,
                    intending to proceed thence into Tartary; but unhappily he never reached that
                    destination. Near the banks of the Kizil-Ozan his party were attacked by
                    banditti, and, according to the report of the survivors, Mr Browne was dragged
                    to a short distance from the road, where he was plundered and murdered.
                    Suspicion attached to his companions, and even to the Persian government, but
                    nothing occurred to confirm these surmises. Some bones, believed to be his, were
                    afterwards found and interred near the grave of Thevenot, the celebrated French
                    traveller.</p>
                <p part="N">Mr Browne, in his person, was thin, rather above the middle size, with a
                    grave and pensive cast of countenance. He entertained an extraordinary
                    predilection for the manners and character of the orientals. Like them, he was
                    in general society silent, reserved, and even repulsive. Even among his most
                    intimate friends he would remain long gloomy and reserved; but after indulging
                    in a pipe his eye brightened, and he related with great animation the
                    interesting scenes through which he had passed. His disposition was friendly,
                    liberal, and generous, and he was distinguished by a strict regard to veracity.
                    Under a cold exterior he cherished an ardent desire to distinguish himself by
                    some memorable achievement, in pursuit of which he was ready to brave danger and
                    death.</p>
                <p part="N">His volume of travels in Africa has already been mentioned. Mr Walpole,
                    in the second volume of his Memoirs relating to European and Asiatic Turkey
                    (4to, 1820), has published, from papers left by him, the account of his journey
                    in 1802 through Asia Minor to Antioch and Cyprus; also Remarks written at
                    Constantinople. No account is preserved of his last journey, except what is
                    contained in a letter to Mr Smithson Tennant.</p>
