                        Breton</hi></label>, an island near the eastern side of the continent of
                    North America, situated between forty-five and forty-seven degrees of north
                    latitude. It is separated from Nova Scotia by a narrow strait called Canso, and
                    is about a hundred miles in length by fifty in breadth. It is surrounded with
                    little sharp-pointed rocks, separated from each other by the waves, above which
                    some of their tops are visible. All its harbours are open to the southeast. On
                    the other parts of the coast there are but few anchoring places for small
                    vessels. Except in the hilly portions, the surface of the country has but little
                    solidity, being everywhere covered with a light moss, and with water. The
                    dampness of the soil is exhaled in fogs, without rendering the air unwholesome;
                    but the climate is very cold, owing either to the number of the lakes, which
                    cover more than half the island and remain frozen for a considerable period of
                    the year, or to the extent of the forests, and the fogs that totally intercept
                    the rays of the sun.</p>
                <p part="N">Though some fishermen had long resorted to this island every summer, not
                    more than twenty or thirty ever settled there. The French, who took possession
                    of it in August 1713, were properly the first inhabitants. They changed its name
                    to that of Isle Royale, and fixed upon Fort Dauphin as their principal
                    settlement. This harbour was two leagues in circumference, and might have been
                    rendered impregnable at a trifling expense; but the difficulty of approaching it
                    occasioned it to be abandoned, after great labour had been bestowed upon the
                    undertaking. The settlers then turned their views to Louisbourg, the access to
                    which was easier; and convenience was thus preferred to security. The
                    fortification of Louisbourg, however, was not begun till the year 1720.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1714 some fishermen, who till then had lived in
                    Newfoundland, settled in this island. It was expected that their number would
                    soon have been increased; but these hopes were disappointed. Some distressed
                    adventurers from Europe, however, came over from time to time to Cape Breton,
                    and the number of inhabitants gradually increased to four thousand. They were
                    settled at Louisbourg, Fort Dauphin, Port Toulouse, Nerucka, and on all the
                    coasts where a proper beach was to be found for drying cod. The inhabitants
                    never applied themselves to agriculture, the soil being wholly unfit ŕòr it.
                    They frequently sowed corn, but it seldom came to maturity; and when it did
                    thrive sð as to be worth reaping, it degenerated so much that it was unfit for
                    seed next harvest. In a word, the soil of Cape Breton seemed calculated to
                    invite none but fishermen and soldiers.</p>
                <p part="N">Though the island was entirely covered with forests before it was
                    inhabited, its woods scarcely ever became an object of trade. The peltry trade
                    was a very inconsiderable object. It consisted only of the skins of a few
                    lynxes, elks, musk-rats, wild cats, bears, otters, and foxes of a red and
                    silver-gray colour. Some of these were procured from a colony of Mickmac Indians
                    who had settled on the island with the French, and never could raise more than
                    sixty men able to bear arms. The rest came from St John’s, or the neighbouring
                    continent. Greater advantages might possibly have been derived from the
                    coalmines, which abound in the island. The strata lie in a horizontal direction;
                    and being only about eight feet below the surface, they may consequently be
                    worked without digging deep or draining off the waters. But notwithstanding the
                    prodigious demand for coal from New England between the year 1745 and 1749,
                    these mines would probably have been forsaken, had not the ships which were sent
                    out to the French islands wanted ballast.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193736040?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6040-0229"/>
                <p part="N">The people of Cape Breton did not send all their fish to Europe. Part
                    was exported to the French southern islands, on board twenty or twenty-five
                    ships of from seventy to a hundred and forty tons burden. Besides the cod, which
                    formed at least half their cargoes, they exported to the other colonies timber,
                    planks, thin oak-boards, salted salmon, and mackcrcl, train-oil, and sea-coal,
                    which were paid for in sugar and coffee, but chiefly in rum and molasses. The
                    island, however, could not consume all these commodities, and as Canada took but
                    a small part of the overplus, it was chiefly bought by the people of New
                    England, who gave in exchange fruits, vegetables, wood, brick, and cattle.</p>
                <p part="N">This island, which may be considered as the key of Canada, was attacked
                    by the English in 1745. The plan of the invasion was laid at Boston, and New
                    England bore the expense of it. A merchant named Pepperel, who had excited,
                    encouraged, and directed the enterprise, was intrusted with the command of an
                    army of 6000 men, which had been levied for the expedition; and these forces,
                    convoyed by a squadron from Jamaica, brought the first news to Cape Breton of
                    the danger that threatened it. But although the advantage of a surprise would
                    have secured the landing without opposition, and the invaders had to encounter
                    but 600 regular troops and 800 inhabitants hastily armed, still the success of
                    the undertaking was precarious. Little could be expected from a militia suddenly
                    assembled, who had never seen an enemy, and who were to act under the direction
                    of sea-officers only. But an incident, fortunate for the invaders, neutralized
                    even this insufficient force.</p>
                <p part="N">The construction and repairs of the fortifications of Louisbourg had
                    always been left to the care of the garrison, and the soldiers were anxious to
                    be employed in these works. But when they found that those who should have paid
                    them appropriated to themselves the profit of their labours, and when the
                    justice they demanded was denied them, they determined to assert their rights,
                    and their indignation rose to such a height that they despised all authority.
                    They had in fact been in open rebellion for six months, when the British
                    appeared before the place. This apparition, however, did not produce the union
                    which was so necessary for the common defence. The soldiers indeed made
                    advances; but their commanders, mistrusting a generosity of which they
                    themselves were incapable, kept their men in a manner prisoners, till an
                    ill-managed defence had reduced them to the necessity of capitulating. The whole
                    island shared the fate of Louisbourg, its only bulwark.</p>
                <p part="N">This valuable possession, restored to France by the treaty of
                    Aix-la-Chapelle, was again attacked by the British in 1758. On the 2d of June, a
                    fleet of twenty-three ships of the line and eighteen frigates, having on board
                    16,000 troops, anchored in Gabarus Bay, within half a league of Louisbourg. It
                    had been attempted to render the landing impracticable near the town; and in the
                    prudent precautions <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> which had been taken, the
                    beśiegers saw the dangers and difficulties they had to expect; but, far from
                    being deterred by these, they had recourse to stratagem, and, extending their
                    line so as to threaten the whole coast, they landed by force of arms at
                    Cormorant Creek. This place was naturally weak. The French had fortified it with
                    a good parapet planted with cannon, behind which they had posted 2000 soldiers
                    and some Indians, while in front they had constructed with felled trees an
                    impenetrable abbattis.</p>
                <p part="N">But these and other precautions that had been taken were rendered
                    abortive by the impetuosity of the French. The English had scarce begun to move
                    towards the shore, when their enemies exposed the snare they had laid for them.
                    By opening a brisk but hasty fire on the boats, and still more by prematurely
                    removing the boughs that masked the forces, the English, apprised of their
                    danger, immediately turned back, and the benefit of these preparations was
                    entirely lost. The situation of the English, however, was still sufficiently
                    critical, especially as they saw no other place to effect a landing on except a
                    rock, which had always been deemed inaccessible. But General Wolfe, while
                    occupied in reirnbarking his troops, and sending off the boats, ordered Major
                    Scott to repair thither; and that officer immediately proceeded towards the spot
                    with his men. The Major’s own boat approached first, but sinking at the very
                    instant he stepped ashore, he climbed up the rock alone, in hopes of meeting
                    with a hundred of his men who had been sent to attempt a landing at another
                    point. Instead of this number, he found only ten; but with these few he gained
                    the summit of the rock, where ten Indians and sixty Frenchmen killed two of them
                    and mortally wounded three. But notwithstanding this loss he stood his ground
                    under cover of a thicket, till the troops, regardless alike of the raging surf
                    and the fire of the cannon, came up to him and put him in full possession of
                    that important post, the only one that could secure the landing. The French, as
                    soon as they saw that the enemy had got a firm footing on land, betook
                    themselves to the only remaining refuge, and shut themselves up in Louisbourg.
                    But the fortifications were in a bad condition; the revêtements of the several
                    curtains had entirely crumbled away; there was but one casemate and a small
                    magazine that were bombproof; and the garrison consisted only of 2900 men.
                    Notwithstanding these disadvantages, however, the besieged made an obstinate
                    resistance; and it was only on the eve of an assault, which it was impossible to
                    sustain, that they talked of surrendering. An honourable capitulation was
                    granted them, and the possession was confirmed to Great Britain by the peace in
                    1763, after which the fortifications were blown up, and the town of Louisbourg
                    dismantled.</p>
