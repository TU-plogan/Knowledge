                    known to the learned by the name of <hi rend="italic">Democritus junior,</hi>
                    was a younger brother of the William Burton who wrote the Antiquities of
                    Leicestershire, and born of an ancient family at Lindley, in that county, upon
                    the 8th of February 1576. He was educated in grammatical learning in the free
                    school of Sutton Colefield, in Warwickshire; in the year 1593 he was sent to
                    Brazen-nose College in Oxford; and in 1599 he was elected student of
                    Christ-church. In 1616 he had conferred upon him by the dean and canons of
                    Christ-church, the vicarage of St Thomas, in the west suburb of Oxford, to the
                    parishioners of which it is said that he always gave the sacrament in wafers;
                    and this, with the rectory of Segrave in Leicestershire, given him some time
                    afterwards by George Lord Berkeley, he held to the day of his death, which
                    happened in January 1639. He was a man of general learning, a distinguished
                    philosopher, an exact mathematician, and, what constitutes the peculiarity of
                    his character, a very curious calculator of nativities. He was extremely
                    studious, and of a melancholy turn; yet an agreeable companion, and very
                    humorous. The <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy,</hi> by <hi rend="italic"
                        >Democritus junior,</hi> as he calls himself, shows that these different
                    qualities were strangely mixed together in his composition. This book was
                    printed first in quarto, afterwards in folio, in 1624, 1632, 1638, and 1652, to
                    the great emolument of the bookseller, who, as Mr Wood tells us, got an estate

                    occasioned strange suspicions. He died in his chamber at or very near the time
                    which, it seems, he had some years before predicted from the calculation of his
                    nativity; and this exactness made it whispered about that, for the glory of
                    astrology, and rather than that his calculation should fail, he became <hi

                    was buried with due solemnity in the cathedral of Christ-church, and had a fair
                    monument erected to his memory. He left behind him a very choice collection of
                    books, many of which he bequeathed to the Bodleian Library, and a hundred pounds
                    to Christ-church, the interest of which was to be laid out yearly in books for
                    their library.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Burton,</hi><hi rend="italic">John,</hi> D.D. a
                    learned divine, was born in 1696, at Wembworth, in Devonshire, of which parish
                    his father was rector. He was educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. In
                    1725, being then pro-proctor and master of the schools, lie spoke a Latin
                    oration before the determining bachelor, which is entitled “<hi rend="italic"
                        >Heli,</hi> or an Instance of a Magistrate’s erring through unseasonable
                    Lenity; written and published with a view to encourage the salutary exercise of
                    academical discipline;” and he afterwards treated the same subject still more
                    fully in four Latin sermons before the university, and published them with
                    appendixes. He also introduced into the schools, Locke, and other eminent modern
                    philosophers, as suitable companions to Aristotle; and printed a double series
                    of philosophical questions for the use of the younger students; from which Mr
                    Johnson of Magdalen College, Cambridge, took the hint of his larger work of the
                    same kind, which has gone through several editions. When the settling of Georgia
                    was in agitation, Dr Bray, justly revered for his institution of parochial
                    libraries, Dr Stephen Hales, Dr Berriman, and other learned divines, entreated
                    Mr Burton’s pious assistance in that undertaking. This -he readily gave, by
                    preaching before the society in 1732, and publishing his sermon, with an
                    appendix on the state of that colony; and he afterwards published an account of
                    the designs of the associates of Dr Bray, with an account of their proceedings.
                    About the same time, on the death of Dr Edward Littleton, hc was presented by
                    Eton College to the vicarage of Maplc-Derham, in Oxfordshire. Here a melancholy
                    scene, which too often appears in the mansions of the clergy, presented itself
                    to his view; a widow, with three infant daughters, without a home, without a
                    fortune. From his compassion arose love, the consequence of which was marriage;
                    for Mrs Littleton was handsome, elegant, accomplished, ingenious, and had great
                    sweetness of temper. In 1760 he exchanged his vicarage of Maple-Derham for the
                    rectory of Wor-plesdon in Surrey. In his advanced age, finding his eyes begin to
                    fail him, he collected and published, in one volume, all his scattered pieces,
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Opuscula</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Miscellanea</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and soon after died, on the 11th
