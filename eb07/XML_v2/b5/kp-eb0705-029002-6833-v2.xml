                        James</hi></label>, a zoologist and natural philosopher, born at
                    Fontenay-le-Comte, 3d April 1723, the son of Mathurin Brisson and Louisa
                    Gabrielle Jourdain. He was originally intended for the church, but he had
                    acquired at an early age a taste for natural history, which was particularly
                    encouraged by the advantage that he enjoyed of passing his holidays with the
                    justly-celebrated Reaumur, who had an estate near Fontenay. At the age of
                    twenty-four he had made great progress in his theological studies, and had fully
                    qualified himself for the rank of a subdeacon; but his courage failed him at the
                    time appointed for taking orders, and he then determined to confine himself to
                    the study of physical sciences. Reaumur had the direction of the chemical
                    laboratory of the Academy of Sciences, and had given up the salary attached to
                    it to several young men in succession, whom he appointed as his assistants, and
                    of whom Pitot and Nollet became afterwards the most distinguished. He now chose
                    Brisson for the situation, which served him, as it had done his predecessors,
                    rather as a step in his advancement with respect to general science, than in
                    enabling him to pursue any objects more immediately chemical; and he followed
                    his passion in attaching himself almost exclusively to natural history. The
                    collection of Reaumur furnished him with ample materials for his studies, and
                    with the principal subjects described in his works on the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Animal Kingdom.</hi> The first of these was published in 1756, containing
                    quadrupeds and cetaceous animals. It consists of simple descriptions of the
                    different species, together with synonyms in various languages, more in the
                    nature of a prodromus than of a complete history. His <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ornithologie</hi> appeared in 1760, forming six volumes, and containing a
                    number of well-executed plates. But upon Reaumur’s death, the collection having
                    been added to the royal cabinet, Messrs Buffon and Daubenton, the directors of
                    that cabinet, not affording him all the accommodations that he expected, he
                    discontinued the work, and altogether renounced the study of natural history in
                    favour of natural philosophy.</p>
                <p part="N">Μ. Brisson had been chosen a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1759:
                    he soon afterwards associated himself with the Abbé Nollet in delivering
                    lectures on experimental physics, and obtained the reversion of his appointments
                    of professor in the college of Navarre, and instructor of the royal family in
                    natural philosophy and natural history. The subject of electricity was at this
                    time warmly debated between Nollet and Franklin; and Μ. Brisson had a difficult
                    task to perform, in discussing the merits of a mistaken friend and an
                    overbearing opponent; but, in fact, this department of science was at that time
                    too little understood to make it disgraceful for Nollet to be in error with
                    respect to the utility of conductors, or for Brisson to remain neutral upon this
                    and other similar questions. He seems, however, by no means to have adhered to
                    the character of neutrality in his anonymous <hi rend="italic">Translation</hi>
                    of Priestley’s <hi rend="italic">History of Electricity,</hi> published in 1771,
                    and accompanied by notes, which exhibit a spirit of acrimonious criticism, not
                    at all calculated to enhance the merit of the work which he wished to introduce
                    to the notice of his countrymen» He also attempted, in an <hi rend="italic"
                        >Essay on Waterspouts,</hi> published in the Memoirs of the academy, to
                    explain a variety of electrical phenomena, by means of the different currents of
                    fluid imagined by Nollet, but certainly with very little success.</p>
                <p part="N">He afterwards undertook a course of experiments on the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Specific Gravity of Alcohol and Water,</hi> mixed in different proportions,
                    which led him to a conjecture, at that time somewhat singular, that water was
                    not a homogeneous substance. Hc assisted Μ. Trudaine and other observers in the
                    experiments which they made on <hi rend="italic">Heat and Light</hi> with the
                    powerful lens of Bernière; and, in conjunction with Μ. Cadct, he endeavoured to
                    disprove the opinion of Beccaria, that electricity has a power of reviving the
                        <hi rend="italic">metallic oxides.</hi> He also made experiments on the <hi
                        rend="italic">refractive powers</hi> of fluids which might be substituted
                    for flint glass in the object-glasses of telescopes; on the utility of different
                    kinds of <hi rend="italic">steel for magnetical purposes;</hi> and on the mode
                    of renewal of the <hi rend="italic">shells of some species of snails.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">In 1772, Μ. Brisson published a memoir on the <hi rend="italic">Specific
                        Gravities of Metals,</hi> a subject which, in all its extent, occupied a
                    great portion of his attention during twenty years of his life. The results of
                    his experiments on a great variety of substances were collected into a single
                    volume of <hi rend="italic">Tables of Specific Gravities,</hi> which was
                    published in 1787. It was principally for the use of students who attended his
                    lectures that he published his <hi rend="italic">Traite de Physique</hi> and his
                        <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire,</hi> both of them containing elementary and
                    popular information, rather calculated exclusively for the immediate purpose
                    which they were intended to serve, than for being of permanent utility in the
                    promotion of the sciences. At a late period of his life he renewed his attention
                    to the subject of chemistry, when the discoveries of his junior contemporaries
                    had given greater certainty and precision to its laws; and his last work was an
                        <hi rend="italic">Elementary Treatise</hi> on that science, intended for the
                    use of his pupils in the central school.</p>
                <p part="N">FIis whole life was occupied in his studies, and the history of his
                    various works comprehends the history of everything that is to be recorded
                    concerning him. After eighty years of uninterrupted activity of mind, an attack
                    of apoplexy reduced him to a state of second childhood, and effaced from his
                    memory all traces even of his native language, except a few words of the dialect
                    of Poitou, which he had spoken when he was a boy. He died on the 23d of June
                    1806, and his place in the academy was filled by Μ. Guy-Lussac. (Delambre, <hi
