                    and <hi rend="italic">Manufactures,</hi> an alloy of copper and zinc. This name,
                    however, has not been exclusively applied to the alloy of these metals; for the
                    gunmetal, which has been also called brass, is an alloy of copper with tin. The
                    same alloy, with more tin, is used in machinery, and is preferred to the alloy
                    of copper and zinc, on account of its greater hardness.</p>
                <p part="N">It appears from the analysis of the brass of the ancients that it was an
                    alloy of copper and tin. A small portion of tin gives to copper great hardness,
                    and renders it capable of bearing much greater resistance. A larger portion of
                    tin gives increased hardness, but is less fitted to bear a straining resistance,
                    on account of its brittleness. Its elasticity is very great, which fits it for
                    bells. In this state it is called bell-metal; and with a still greater
                    proportion of tin it forms an alloy employed for the mirrors of reflecting
                    telescopes. The alloy of copper with tin is easily distinguished from that with
                    zinc, from the agreeable colour of the latter, which varies with the proportions
                    of the metals. Pinchbeck has the least proportion of zinc. Common brass has more
                    zinc, and the gold-coloured alloy called prince’s metal contains a still greater
                    proportion of zinc. An alloy of copper with a very large proportion of zinc is
                    used for the common white metal buttons.</p>
                <p part="N">i The various alloys of copper with tin and zinc forming the different
                    kinds of brass, are to be considered as chemical compounds, and, of course,

                <p part="N">Hitherto the proportions of these alloys have depended upon the practice
                    of workmen, guided by numerous trials; but what confirms the law of definite
                    proportions, is the necessity of adhering to fixed proportions, ascertained by
                    trial. By attending to the proportions pointed out in the above tables, the most
                    striking and proper compounds will be produced, without the trouble of trying.
                    Any intermediate proportions will, doubtless, be marked by defective colour,
                    irregular crystallization, or imperfect malleability.</p>
                <p part="N">Although the most direct way of forming these different kinds of brass
                    is by immediately combining the metals together, one of them, which is most
                    properly called brass, was manufactured long before ziric, one of its component
                    parts, was known in its metallic form. The ore of the <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193735481?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0705-5481-0186"/>latter
                    metal was cemented with sheets of copper, charcoal being present; and the zinc
                    was united with the copper, without becoming visible in a distinct form. The
                    same method is still practised for making brass.</p>
                <p part="N">The materials used in making brass are copper in small round masses,
                    produced by passing the melted metal through an appropriate vessel into water,
                    in which state it is called shot copper; and calamine, an ore of zinc. This
                    latter substance is a carbonate of zinc, often containing some oxide of iron,
                    which gives it a reddish appearance. As it is chiefly found in combination with
                    lead, the lumps frequently contain more or less gallcna, which requires to be
                    separated by the same means as those employed for purifying lead ore. The
                    calamine is first reduced to powder, and the lead is then separated by washing.
                    When the calamine is separated, reduced to powder, and sifted, it is heated upon
                    the hearth of a reverberatory furnace. This expels the volatile matter, which is
                    principally water and carbonic acid. What remains is principally oxide of zinc,
                    abounding with some earthy matter, and probably much carbonic acid, which is not
                    all expelled by the heat. The calamine thus prepared, charcoal powder, and
                    copper, are the materials to be operated upon. The proportions in which they are
                    mixed together are equal weights of copper and prepared calamine, and ⅛th their
                    weight of powdered charcoal.</p>
                <p part="N">This mixture, intimately blended, is compressed into a crucible of the
                    form of fig. 3, Plate CXXVII. One of these crucibles holds about 100 lbs. of
                    brass when the process is finished; but as this consists of the pure copper and
                    zinc, the pot, when charged, will contain of copper 66 ’ 3 lbs., of calamine 63
                    lbs., and of charcoal powder 13 lbs. When the crucible is filled, the contents
                    should be covered with a mixture of clay sand and horse-dung, in order to defend
                    the metals and charcoal from the action of the air. When this covering is
                    strictly attended to, less charcoal powder may be employed, and a larger dose of
                    the other ingredients may be put in its place; but it is generally the most
                    defective part of the process.</p>

                    air, whieh passes through the openings in the arch, into the fires. The bottom
                    of the furnace is not a common grate, but a thick plate of castmetal, perforated
                    with holes for the air to pass through; one hole being between each pot, as they
                    are seen arranged in fig. 1, at I, I, and also in the section at <hi
                        rend="italic">x, y.</hi> When the pots are put upon the plate, the fire is
                    not placed immediately upon them, as it would not only injure them, but displace
                    the covering. To prevent this, the pots are first covered by some dried heath or
                    common brambles, which defend them for a time, when the fuel is thrown in. By
                    the time the brambles are consumed the coal will have coked upon the pots, and
                    thus act as a defence for the rest of the process. The fire is kept up from
                    twelve to twenty hours at the Cheudle brass-works in Staffordshire, from which
                    these drawings were taken. They cast twice in the twenty-four hours.</p>
                <p part="N">After the refuse is skimmed off, the melted brass is cast into ingots if
                    sold for melting over again, and into plates if intended to be rolled into
                    sheets or made into wire. The plates are cast between large blocks of Cornwall
                    stone. The lower stone is fixed, and the face made even and smooth, by filling
                    up the recesses of the rough stone with fine sand. The upper stone is similarly
                    prepared, and is suspended, over the fixed one. The height and breadth of the
                    place to receive the metal is limited by iron bars laid on the lower stone. The
                    upper stone is then let down upon the bars. The lower stone is a little longer
                    than the upper one, and projects to the front. Being a little higher in that
                    part, it forms a lip or mouthpiece for receiving the metal. The flat sides of
                    the cast plate are therefore bounded by the surface of the stones, and the edges
                    of these by the bars above mentioned. The ingot moulds are recesses in blocks of
                    cast-iron, open on one side.</p>
                <p part="N">The most certain and correct method of forming brass and the other
                    compounds expressed in the table above given, is by immediately uniting the
                    metals in given weights. It should, however, be observed, that it will he found
                    difficult to introduce zinc into melted copper. The best way of uniting it with
                    copper, in the first instance, is to introduce the copper in thin slips into the
                    melted zinc, till the alloy requires a considerable heat to fuse it, and then to
                    unite this alloy with the melted copper.</p>

                        Brass,</hi> famous in antiquity, is a mixture of gold, silver, and copper.
                    Lucius Mummius having sacked and burnt the city of Corinth, 146 years before
                    Christ, it is said this metal was formed from the immense quantities of gold,
                    silver, and copper, with which that city abounded, having been melted and run
                    together by the violence of the conflagration.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Brass,</hi> in the glass trade. Thrice calcined
                    brass is a preparation employed by glassmen to give many very beautiful colours
                    to their work. The manner of preparing it is this: Having placed thin plates of
                    brass on tiles on the leet of the furnace, near the occhis, let it stand to be
                    calcined there for four days, and it will become a black powder sticking
                    together in lumps. Pulverize this, sift it fine, and recalcine it during four or
                    five days more; at the end of which time it will not stick together, but remain
                    a loose powder of a russet colour. This is to be calcined a third time in the
                    same manner; but great care must be taken in the third calcination that it be
                    neither overdone nor underdone. The way to be certain when it is right, is, to
                    try it several times in glass while melting. If it causes the glass, when well
                    purified, to swell, boil, and rise, it is properly calcined; if not, it requires
                    longer time. This, according to the different proportions in which it is used,
                    produces a sea-green, an emerald-green, or a turquoise colour.</p>
                <p part="N">Brass, by long calcination alone, and without any mixture, affords a
                    fine blue or green colour for glass; but there is a method of calcining it also
                    with powdered brimstone, so as to make it afford a red, a yellow, or a
                    chalcedony colour, according to the quantity and other variations in the using
                    of it. Tlιis method of calcination is the following: Cut thin plates of brass
                    into small pieces with shears, and lay them <hi rend="italic">stratum super
                        stratum,</hi> with alternate beds of powdered sulphur, in a crucible ’,
                    calcine this for twenty-four hours in a strong fire, then powder and sift the
                    whole, and finally expose the powder upon tiles for twelve davs to a
                    reverberating furnace, at the end of which time powder it fine and keep it for
                    use. The glass-makers have also a method of precuring a red powder from brass by
                    a more simple calcination, which serves for many colours. The method of
                    preparing it is this: They put small and thin plates of brass into the arches of
                    the glass furnaces, and leave them there till they are sufficiently calcined,

                        xml:id="kp-eb0705-5494-0187"/>which the heat in that place, not being
                    sufficient to melt them, doos in great perfection. The ealcined matter,
                    powdered, is of a dusky red, and requires no further preparation.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">ERASS-Colour,</hi> one prepared by the braziers and
                    colourmen to imitate brass. There are two sorts of it, the red brass or bronze,
                    and the yellow or gilt brass. The latter is made only of coppcr-fiīings, the
                    smallest and brightest that can be found; with the former it is usual to mix
                    some red ochre, finely pulverized; and both are used with varnish. In order to
                    make a fine brass that will not take any rust or verdigris, it must be dried
                    with a chafing-dish of coals as soon as it is applied. The finest brass-colour
                    is made of powdered brass imported from Germany, diluted into a varnish, whieh
                    is prepared and used after the following manner: The varnish is eomposed <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> one pound four ounces <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    spirits of wine, two ounces of gum-lae, and two ounces of sandarae; these two
                    last drugs being pulverized separately, and afterwards put to dissolve in spirit
                    of wine, and care being taken to fill the bottle but half full. The varnish
                    being made, mix a quantity <hi rend="italic">of</hi> it with the pulverized
                    brass, and apply it with a small brush to that whieh it is intended to brass
                    over. But too mueh must not be mixed at once, beeause the varnish being very apt
                    to dry, it would not be possible to employ it all soon enough. It is therefore
                    better to make the mixture at several times. In this manner are brassed over
                    figures of plaster, which look almost as well as if they were of cast brass.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Brass</hi><hi rend="italic">Leaf</hi> is
                    made of eopper, beaten into very thin plates, and afterwards rendered yellow.
                    The German artists, particularly those <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Nuremberg and
                    Augsburg, are said to possess the best method of giving to these thin plates of
                    eopper a fine yellow eolour like gold, by simply exposing them to the fumes of
                    zine, without any real mixture of it with the metal. These plates are cut into
                    little pieces, and then beaten out fine like leaves of gold; after which they
                    are put into books of coarse paper and sold at a low priee for the vulgar kinds
                    of gilding. The parings or shreds of these very thin yellow leaves, being well
                    ground on a marble plate, are rcdueed to a powder similar to gold, which serves
                    to eover, by means <hi rend="italic">of</hi> gum-water or some other glutinous
                    fluid, the surfaec of various mouldings or pieees of eurious workmanship, giving
                    them the appearance of real bronze, and even of fine gold, at a very trifling
                    expense, because the gold eolour of this metallie powder may be easily raised
                    and improved by stirring it in a wide earthen bason over a slow fire.</p>
