                    consanguinity; by the canon law they are in the first degree. By the Mosaic law
                    the brother of a man who died without issue was obliged to marry the widow of
                    the deeeased. Deuter, xxv. 7. The aneients applied the term brother
                    indifferently to almost all who stood related in the collateral line, as uneles
                    and nephews, eousin germans, and the like. This we learn not only from a great
                    many passages in the Old Testament, but also from profane authors. Cicero, in
                    his Philippics, says, Antonia was both wife and sister of Mark Antony, beeause
                    she was daughter of his brother C. Antonius. And as to eousins, Tullus
                    Hostilius, in Dionysius Halicarnasseus, ealls the Horatii and Curiatii brothers,
                    because they were sisters’ children. The language of the Jews, Bishop Pearson
                    observes, ineluded in the name of brethren not only the <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193740759?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0705-0759-0592"/>strict
                    relation of fraternity, but also the larger one of consanguinity. We are
                    brethren, says Abraham to Lot, Gen. xiii. 8, whereas Lot was only his nephew. So
                    Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, Gen. xxix. 12, whereas he
                    was only her father’s nephew. This consideration has been urged with good
                    advantage against the Antidicomarianites, who, from the mention made of the
                    brethren of Jesus, John ii. 12, Matt. xii. 46, have impugned the perpetual
                    virginity of the mother of Christ. Among us it is customary for kings to give
                    the title of brother to each other; the unction in coronation being esteemed to
                    create a kind of brotherhood. Nor is the custom modern. Menander mentions a
                    letter of Cosroes king of Persia to the emperor Justinian, beginning thus:
                    “Cosroes, king of kings, to the emperor Justinian my brother.” Kings now also
                    give the same appellation to the electors of the empire. In the civil law,
                    brothers, <hi rend="italic">fratres,</hi> in the plural, sometimes comprehends
                    sisters; as <hi rend="italic">Lucius</hi><hi rend="italic">et Titia,
                        fratres</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">tres fratres,
                        Titius,</hi><hi rend="italic">Moevius,</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                        Seia.</hi><hi rend="italic">Foster-B</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                        roτhers,</hi> those who have been suckled by the same nurse. The French call
                    them <hi rend="italic">fratres</hi><hi rend="italic">du</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >lait,</hi> or brothers by milk; which is most properly used in respect of a
                    person who had been suckled by a nurse at the same time with the nurse’s own
                    child.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Brother</hi> was also used by the writers of the
                    middle ages for a <hi rend="italic">conies,</hi> or governor of a province.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Brother</hi> is applied, in a less proper sense, to
                    denote a person of the same profession; in which sense judges, bishops, priests,
                    call each other brothers.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Brother</hi> is also a customary term by which
                    priests of the same persuasion address one another: but it is more particularly
                    used to denote the relation between monks of the same convent; as Brother
                    Zachary. In English we more usually say Friar Zachary, from the French word <hi
                        rend="italic">frère,</hi> brother. Preachers also call their hearers <hi
                        rend="italic">my brethren,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">my dear brethren.</hi>
                    This appellation is borrowed from the primitive Christians, who all called each
                    other <hi rend="italic">brothers.</hi> But it is now principally used for such
                    of the religious as are not priests; those in orders are generally honoured with
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">father,</hi> whereas the rest are only simple
                    brothers.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Brother</hi> is also an appellation more peculiarly
                    given to certain orders of religious.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Brothers</hi><hi rend="italic">of
                        Arms,</hi> an appellation given to those who contract a kind of fraternity
                    in war, obliging themselves to the mutual service and assistance of each other.
                    In the military orders the knights are also called <hi rend="italic"
                        >brothers.</hi> In the order of Malta there is a particular class who are
                    called <hi rend="italic">serving brothers,</hi> consisting of such as cannot
                    give proof of their nobility. In Latin they are denominated <hi rend="italic"
                        >fratres</hi><hi rend="italic">clientes.</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
