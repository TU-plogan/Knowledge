                        Alexander</hi></label>, a younger son of Robert Boyd of Pinkill in Ayrshire,
                    was born on the 13th of January 1562. He is said to have comc into the world
                    provided with a couple of teeth. He learned the rudiments of the Latin and Greek
                    languages at Glasgow under two grammarians, but was of so high and untractable a
                    spirit, that they despaired of ever making him a scholar. Having quarrelled with
                    his masters, he beat them both, burnt his books, and forswore learning. His
                    uncle, James Boyd of Trochrig, was at that time archbishop of Glasgow; and, as
                    he soon lost his father, his academical studies were conducted under the
                    superintendence of this relation. After he entered the university, he was
                    engaged in some very riotous proceedings, which have been particularly detailed
                    by the able biographer of Melville. While he was yet a youth he followed the
                    court, and exerted the usual means of obtaining preferment; but the fervour of
                    his temper soon precipitated him into quarrels, from which he came off with
                    honour and safety, though frequently at the hazard of his life. As he was nearly
                    related to Lord Boyd, it is probable that he relied chiefly on his patronage;
                    but, as Lord Hailes remarks, “all that we learn of his proficiency at court is,
                    that he fought one duel, and was engaged in numberless broils.” With the
                    approbation of his friends, he went to serve in the French army, and carried
                    with him his little patrimony, which he soon dissipated at play. He was shortly
                    after roused by that emulation which is natural to superior minds, and applied
                    himself to letters with unremitted ardour, till he attained to no mean
                    proficiency as a scholar. Leaving his native country in 1581, when only in his
                    twentieth year, he was not yet past the age of academical study; and he attended
                    the lectures of several professors in the university of Paris, particularly
                    those of Passerat, professor of eloquence, and of Genebrand, professor of
                    Hebrew. Having next directed his attention to the civil law, he went to Orleans,
                    and became a pupil of J. Robert, “a man principally known for having dared to
                    become the antagonist of Cujacius.” But from the university of Orleans he
                    speedily removed to that of Bourges, where he is said to have obtained the
                    friendship of Cujacius, by writing some verses in obsolete Latin; and, as one of
                    his biographers has suggested, that learned man could not fail to relish verses
                    which approached the standard of the twelve Tables.</p>
                <p part="N">The plague having driven him from Bourges, he sought a place of refuge
                    at Lyon; and, when the infection extended to that city, he retired into Italy,
                    where he contracted a friendship with a person whom he names Cornelius Varus.
                    Having been seized with an ague, he returned to Lyon to try the effect of change
                    of air; and the only regret which he felt in quitting Italy, is said to have
                    arisen from his being thus deprived of the literary conversation and salutary
                    advice of his friend. It was about the year 1585 that he revisited France. In
                    1587 he served with the royal forces opposed to the mercenary army of Germans
                    and Swiss, which had invaded that country to support the king of Navarre. He
                    served under an officer of cavalry, who was a Greek by birth; and, during this
                    campaign, he was wounded by a shot in the ancle. In 1588 he took up his abode in
                    Toulouse, and applied himself to the study of the civil law under Roaldes, a
                    professor of eminence. About the same period he appears to have written several
                    tracts on the science of jurisprudence, and even to have projected a
                    systematical work on the law of nature and nations. But his studies met with an
                    unforeseen interruption, in consequence of the tumults which ensued at Toulouse,
                    and during which the first president Duranty, the advocate-general Dafis, and
                    other individuals of inferior quality, were murdered by the inhabitants. During
                    this season of outrage Boyd was thrown into prison; and, as innocence afforded
                    him no security, he was exposed to immincnt danger of his life; but he owed his
                    deliverance to the intercession of some of his friends. He now retired to
                    Rochelle; but as the climate did not agree with his constitution, he afterwards
                    fixed his residence at Fontenay in Poictou. In this retreat he devoted much of
                    his time to study, and occasionally resumed the avocation of a soldier, for
                    which he retained a violent propensity. He is reported to have acted as
                    preceptor to a young French gentleman of the reformed religion, but of such an
                    engagement his own writings communicate no information. About the year 1591 he
                    appears to have formed a design of reading lectures on the civil law; and the
                    heads of his prelections on the Institutes of Justinian are still preserved
                    among his other papers in the Advocates Library.</p>
                <p part="N">His friends in Scotland, and among others Patrick Sharpe, under whom he
                    had studied in the university of Glasgow, urged him to return to his native
                    country; but, according to his own account, the state of his health had long
                    obliged him to live obscurely in France, and his scanty circumstances would not
                    allow him to make a tolerable figure in Scotland. He endeavoured however to
                    strengthen his interest in his native land, by dedicating to James the Sixth a
                    collection of his poems and epistles, printed at Antwerp, 1592, in 12mo. Three
                    years afterwards, while preparing to return home, he received intelligence of
                    the death of his elder brother William, for whom he apparently cherished a very
                    sincere affection. Of his subsequent history, few particulars have been
                    recorded. We are however informed that he at length returned to Scotland; and,
                    after a short residence having undertaken to accompany the earl of Cassilis in
                    his travels, he completed this engagement, and once more revisited his native
                    country, where he died of a slow fever, on the 10th of April 1601. At the time
                    of his death he was only in the fortieth year of his age.</p>
                <p part="N">Boyd appears to havc been a person of a restless and turbulent
                    disposition; and, as he added courage to strength, his sword must at least have
                    been as formidable as his pen. He was tall, robust, and well-proportioned, and,
                    possessing a handsome and pleasing countenance, he had much of the gallant
                    bearing of a soldier. His literary vanity was not the least conspicuous part of
                    his character. He was however a man of genius; and if his disposition and
                    circumstances had been more favourable for persevering and systematic exertion,
                    he might have secured a high reputation among the scholars of the age.<note
