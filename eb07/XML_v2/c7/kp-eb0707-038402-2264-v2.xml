                        di</hi></label>, a celebrated Italian historian and poet of the sixteenth
                    century, descended of a noble Neapolitan family, and lord of Cantalupo, was born
                    at Naples about the year 1.507. Connected by ties of friendship with Sannazaro,
                    and several other great men who then lived in the capital, he was eneouraged by
                    them in his taste for study, and in the design of writing a history of the
                    kingdom of Naples, which was still a desideratum; the work of Collenuaecio being
                    deemed incomplete, partial, and full of errors. lie employed more than forty
                    years in researches, particularly in the perusal and examination of the old
                    chronicles and ancient titles, and then published at Naples the first part of
                    his work in eight books. This specimen of his labours appeared in the year 1572,
                    in quarto; but the author, being dissatisfied with his performance, set himself
                    to eorrect, augment, and reconstruct it almost from the foundation. At length,
                    in 1582, the work came forth in the shape in which it now appears, under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Istorie del Regno di Napoli
                        dal</hi> 1250 <hi rend="italic">Ji no al</hi> 1489, <hi rend="italic"

                    Aquila, folio, an edition which has now become very scarce even in Italy. The
                    author therein treats of the period from the death of the Emperor Frederick II.
                    to the war of Milan under King Ferdinand I.; and although lie has fallen into
                    some errors, which were perhaps unavoidable in such a work, yet his history of
                    the kingdom of Naples is still regarded as one of the best extant. It was
                    reprinted at Naples, but very incorrectly, in 1710, 4to; and again, but with
                    more care, in 1733, 4to. Lastly, it has been embodied in the great Milan <hi

                    Costanzo, who died at Naples about the year 1591, also occupies a distinguished
                    rank among the poets of his age. His master in poetry was Berardino Rota, whom
                    he greatly surpassed; and although he made no change in the form of the sonnet,
                    which he adopted as he found it, yet he gave it a turn which the best poets have
                    since taken as their model. His poetry in general is distinguished for the union
                    of gravity with sensibility, which, in truth, constitutes its peculiar
                    characteristic. His <hi rend="italic">Rime,</hi> originally scattered throughout
                    different collections, appeared for the first time together at Bologna, in 1709,
                    12mo. They have since been several times reprinted; but of all the editions, the
                    best are those of Comino, Padua, 1723, 1728, and 1738, 8vo.</p>
