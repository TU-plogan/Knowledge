                <p part="N"><label type="entry">CONGRUITY</label>, a suitableness or relation of
                    agreement between things.</p>
                <p part="N">The terms <hi rend="italic">congruity</hi><hi rend="italic">Άηά</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">propriety</hi> are not applicable to any single object; they
                    imply a plurality, and obviously signify a particular relation between different
                    objects. Thus we are accustomed to say, that a decent garb is suitable or proper
                    for a judge, modest behaviour for a young woman, and a lofty style for an epic
                    poem; and, on the other hand, that it is unsuitable or incongruous to see a
                    little woman sunk in an overgrown farthingale, a coat richly embroidered
                    covering coarse and dirty linen, a mean subject in a pompous style, an elevated
                    subject in mean language, a first minister darning his wife’s stocking, or a
                    reverend prelate in lawn sleeves dancing a hornpipe.</p>
                <p part="N">The perception w e have of this relation, which seems peculiar to man,
                    cannot proceed from any other cause than a <hi rend="italic">sense</hi> of
                    congruity or propriety; for, supposing us destitute of this sense, the terms
                    would be to us unintelligible.</p>
                <p part="N">It is a matter of experience that congruity or propriety, wherever
                    perceived, is agreeable; and that incongruity or impropriety, wherever
                    perceived, is disagreeable. The only difficulty is to ascertain what are the
                    particular objects which in conjunction suggest these relations; for there are
                    many objects that do not. The sea, for example, viewed in conjunction with a
                    picture, or a man viewed in conjunction with a mountain, suggest not either
                    congruity or incongruity. It seems natural to infer, what indeed will be found
                    true by induction, that we never perceive congruity or incongruity except among
                    things which are connected together by some relation; such as a man and his
                    actions, a principal and his accessories, a subject and its ornaments. We are
                    indeed so framed by nature, that things thus connected require a certain
                    suitableness or correspondence, termed <hi rend="italic">congnιity</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">propriety</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and hence we feel
                    displeasure when we discover the opposite relation of <hi rend="italic"
                        >incongruity</hi> or <hi rend="italic">impropriety.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">If things connected be the subject of congruity, it is reasonable to
                    expect that a degree of congruity proportioned to the degree of the connexion
                    should be required; and, upon examination, we find this to be fact. Where the
                    relation is intimate, as between a cause and its effect, a whole and its parts,
                    we require the strictest congruity; but where the relation is slight or
                    accidental, as among things jumbled together in the same place, we require
                    little or no congruity. The strictest propriety is required in behaviour and
                    manner of living, because a man is connected with these by the relation of cause
                    and effect. The relation between an edifice and the ground it stands upon is of
                    the most intimate kind; and, therefore, the situation of a great house ought to
                    be lofty; its relation to neighbouring hills, rivers, plains, being that of
                    propinquity only, demands but a small share of congruity. Among members of the
                    same club the congruity ought to be considerable, as well as among things placed
                    for show in the same niche; among passengers in a stage-coach we require very
                    little congruity, and less still at a public spectacle.</p>
                <p part="N">Congruity is so nearly allied to beauty, as commonly to be held a
                    species of it; and yet they differ so essentially as never to coincide. Beauty,
                    like colour, is placed upon a single subject; congruity upon a plurality; and a
                    thing beautiful in itself may, with relation to other things, produce the
                    strongest sense of incongruity.</p>
                <p part="N">Congruity and propriety are commonly reckoned synonymous terms, but they
                    are distinguishable, and the precise meaning of each must be ascertained.
                    Congruity is the genus of which propriety is a species; for we call nothing
                    proper, but that congruity or suitableness which ought to subsist between
                    sensible beings and their thoughts, words, and actions.</p>
