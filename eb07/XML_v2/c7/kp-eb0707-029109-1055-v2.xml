                        rend="italic">consulendo,</hi> and annually chosen in the Campus Martius.
                    The two first consuls were L. Junius Brutus and L. Tarquinius Collatinus, who
                    were chosen in the year of Rome 244, immediately after the expulsion of the
                    Tarquins. In the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751068?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0707-1068-0292"/>first times of the republic, the two consuls
                    were always chosen from patrician families or noblemen; but, in the year of Rome
                    388, the people obtained the privilege of electing one of the consuls from their
                    own body, and sometimes both were plebeians. The first consul elected from among
                    the plebeians was L. Sextius. It was required that every candidate for the
                    consulship should be forty-three years of age, which was called <hi
                        rend="italic">legitimum tempus.</hi> He was always to appear at the election
                    as a private man without retinue; atìd it was requisite, before he canvassed for
                    the office, to have discharged the functions of quaestor, edile, and praetor.
                    But these qualifications were sometimes disregarded. Valerius Corvinus was made
                    consul in his twenty-third year, and Scipio in his twenty-fourth. Young Marius,
                    Pompey, and Augustus, were also under the proper age when they were invested
                    with the office; and Pompey had never been quaestor nor praetor. The power of
                    the consuls was unbounded, and they knew no superior except the gods and the
                    laws; but after the expiration of their office their conduct was minutely
                    scrutinized by the people, and misbehaviour was often punished by the laws. The
                    badge of their office was the <hi rend="italic">proetexta,</hi> a robe fringed
                    with purple, afterwards exchanged for the <hi rend="italic">toga</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">picta</hi> or <hi rend="italic">palmata.</hi> They were
                    preceded by twelve lictors carrying the <hi rend="italic">fasces</hi> or bundles
                    of sticks, in the middle of which appeared an axe. The axe, as be⅛g the
                    characteristic rather of tyranny than of freedom, was removed from the <hi
                        rend="italic">fasces</hi> by Valerius Poplicola; but it was restored by bis
                    successor. By turns monthly they were preceded by the lictors while at Rome,
                    lest the appearance of two persons invested with the badges of royal authority
                    should raise apprehensions in the multitude. While one appeared publicly in
                    state, only a crier walked before the other, and the lictors followed behind
                    without the fasces. Their authority was equal; yet the Valerian law gave the
                    right of priority to the elder, and the Julian law to him who had most children;
                    and he was generally called <hi rend="italic">consul major</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">prior.</hi> As their power was absolute, they presided over
                    the senate, and could convene and dismiss it at pleasure. The senators were
                    their counsellors; and among the Romans the manner of reckoning their year was
                    by the name of the consuls; hence, by <hi rend="italic">Μ. Tull.
                        Cicerone</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">L. Antonio</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Consulibus,</hi> for instance, the year of Rome 689 was always
                    understood. This custom lasted from the year of Rome 244 till 1294, or the 541st
                    year of the Christian era. In public assemblies the consuls sat in ivory chairs,
                    and held in their hand an ivory wand called <hi rend="italic">scipio
                        eburneus,</hi> which had an eagle on its top as a sign of dignity and power.
                    When they had drawn by lot the provinces over which they were to preside during
                    their consulship, they went to the capitol to offer prayers to the gods, and
                    entreat them to protect the republic; after which they departed from the city
                    arrayed in their military dress, and preceded by the lictors. Sometimes the
                    provinces were assigned them without drawing lots, by the will and appointment
                    of the senators. At their departure they were provided by the state with
                    whatever was requisite during their expedition. In their provinces they were
                    both attended by the twelve lictors, and equally invested with regal authority.
                    They were not permitted to return to Rome without the special command of the
                    senate; and they always remained in the province till the arrival of their
                    successor. At their return they harangued the people, and solemnly protested
                    that they had done nothing against the laws or interest of their country, but
                    had faithfully and diligently endeavoured to promote the greatness and welfare
                    of the state. No man could be consul for two years successively; yet this
                    institution was sometimes broken, and we find Marius, after the expiration of
                    his office, re-elected consul during the Cimbrian war. The office of consul, so
                    dignified during the times of the commonwealth, became a mere title under the
                    emperors, and retained nothing of its authority but the useless ensigns of
                    original dignity. Even the duration of the office, which was orginally annual,
                    was reduced to two or three months by Julius Caesar; but they who were admitted
                    on the first of January denominated the year, and were called <hi rend="italic"
                        >ordinarii.</hi> Their successors during the year were distinguished by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">suffecti.</hi> Tiberius and Claudius abridged the time
                    of the consulship; and the Emperor Commodus made no less than twenty-five
                    consuls in one year. Constantine the Great renewed the original institution, and
                    permitted them to remain a whole year in office.</p>
