                <p part="N">In disposing and putting together our thoughts, there are two modes of
                    proceeding equally within our choice; for we may arrange the truths relating to
                    any part of knowledge as they presented themselves to the mind in the course of
                    investigation, carrying on the series of proofs in a reverse order, till at last
                    they terminate in first principles; or, beginning with these principles, we may
                    take the contrary mode, and from them deduce, by a direct train of reasoning,
                    the several propositions we want to establish.</p>
                <p part="N">This diversity in the manner of arranging our thoughts gives rise to the
                    twofold division of method established among logicians. The first is the <hi
                        rend="italic">analytic</hi> method, or the method of <hi rend="italic"
                        >resolution,</hi> inasmuch as it traces things back to their source, and
                    resolves knowledge into its first and original principles. And this stands in
                    contradistinction to the method of composition, or, as it is otherwise called,
                    the <hi rend="italic">synthetic</hi> method; for here we proceed by gathering
                    together the several scattered parts of knowledge, and combining them into one
                    system, in such a manner as that the understanding is enabled distinctly to
                    follow truth through all the different stages of gradation.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Composition,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Music,</hi>
                    is the art of composing airs, which, being either singly or in parts combined
                    together, and accompanied with appropriate harmony, form a complete piece of
                    music.</p>
                <p part="N">Compositions have been generally divided into two capital species; the
                        <hi rend="italic">sacred</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">secular.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Sacred compositions are usually written in strict observance of the
                    rules of harmony, in order to produce a solemn and imposing effect; and to this
                    end also all the parts are conducted in studied and regular progressions. Hence
                    this species has been called rigorous or severe. Albrechtsberger limits the
                    severe style to compositions for voices only, without instrumental
                    accompaniments; but he remarks, at the same time, that they are frequently
                    executed along with the organ and other instruments. The severe style has been
                    accurately observed by the greatest ancient and modern writers, in fugues and
                    other movements of a measured and uniform character; but the species <hi
                        rend="italic">sacred</hi> must not be understood to comprehend the whole
                    range of compositions commonly so called, many of which abound in free and
                    fanciful melodies, with full and rich instrumentation.</p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">secular</hi> species affords a wider range to
                    genius, and subsists in greater variety than the <hi rend="italic">sacred.</hi>
                    The composer in this style is completely unfettered. He may exert all ιis
                    inventive powers to heighten the effect of his music. He is tied down to no
                    rules save those which are dictated by taste and judgment, without which no
                    composition can give real satisfaction. The <hi rend="italic">secular</hi> style
                    is subdivided into two kinds, <hi rend="italic">theatrical</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">chamber</hi> music. The former is that employed in operas; the
                    latter includes solos, concertos, airs, cappricios, fantasias, vocal and
                    instrumental pieces, and, in general, all sorts of composition which do not fall
                    under the sacred or severe style, or belong to the regular stage opera.</p>
                <p part="N">An intimate acquaintance with musical science and the capabilities of
                    instruments, although essential as a foundation, will not of itself confer the
                    power and ability to compose. Conversant with mere mechanical rules, one is no
                    more qualified to understand the art, and operate in the practice of
                    composition, than to form himself for eloquence upon the rules of grammar. The
                    acquisition of such knowledge is only the preparative for composition, <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ii</hi> The composer must find in his own genius,” as
                    Rousseau observes, “the sources of beautiful melody, of sublime harmony, the
                    picturesque and the expressive in music; he must, in short, be capable of
                    perceiving and of forming the order of the whole piece; to follow the
                    relations.and aptitudes of which it is susceptible in every kind; to inflame his
                    soul with the spirit and enthusiasm of the poet, instead of being carried away
                    with the mere sound of the words.”</p>
                <p part="N">Every composition is either vocal or instrumental, and has a determined
                    number of parts. In vocal music the compass of the human voice must be
                    particularly attended to. In instrumental music the extension of the parts is
                    regulated by the compass of the instruments, and the harmony ought always to be
                    subservient to the expression of the melody.</p>
                <p part="N">The great aim in all kinds of musical composition is to produce îimŵ/and
                        <hi rend="italic">variety,</hi> because without these two qualities no work
                    can be essentially pleasing. Their employment must be mutual, and, above all,
                    judicious. A piece of music having unity without variety is poor and monotonous;
                    but possessing variety without unity, it maybe compared to the dress of a
                    harlequin, made up of patches and colours, which, in point of effect, appears
                    altogether ridiculous. Every piece of music must, therefore, have at the same
                    time both <hi rend="italic">unity</hi> and <hi rend="italic">variety.</hi> It is
                    then a genuine production of art, the result of well-directed talent, and a
                    model for artists. <hi rend="italic">Variety</hi> is attained by avoiding
                    monotony; <hi rend="italic">unity</hi> by connecting ideas in a free and
                    perspicuous manner, attending to just proportion, and keeping clear of
                    heterogeneous construction.</p>
                <p part="N">It is easy to define what is termed unity in the other fine arts,
                    because they are chiefly addressed to the understanding, which judges for
                    itself. Thus, for instance, there is no difficulty in observing the unities of
                    time, place, and action in dramatic poetry, in which there are fixed principles
                    to guide an author with the utmost certainty. But in music, which is an art in
                    which the understanding cannot competently judge, and where every thing is
                    dictated and created by feeling only, it is impossible to indicate in what <hi
                        rend="italic">variety,</hi> and particularly <hi rend="italic">unity,</hi>
                    in music actually consist. Clear perception, well-regulated taste, and genius,
                    are all essential to enable a composer to attain facility in composition.
                    Incalculable benefit will be reaped by carefully analyzing the best models of
                    art, such as the works of Handel, Jomelli, Cimarosa, Mozart, Haydn, and
                    Beethoven. The monotony of sounds, progressions, and cadences, is relieved by
                    pleasing and natural modulations, which do not affect unity. A happy mixture of
                    diapasons, pianos, and fortes, different rhythms, long and short phrases, and
                    periods symmetrically distributed, together with notes of different length, and
                    well proportioned intervals, all tend to produce <hi rend="italic"
                        >variety</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whilst, on the other hand, whatever is
                    confused, either in modulation or ideas, is oflensive to feeling, and
                    consequently detrimental to <hi rend="italic">unity.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">It has been observed that a multiplicity of different ideas, crowded
                    together in one piece, is reprehensible. It is for that reason desirable that
                    the composer should revert to his primarily-divulged ideas, and continue to
                    develope, modify, and vary them. The best works of Haydn are constructed on two
                    or three leading ideas. That celebrated composer used to say, “When I found a
                    happy idea, I obliged myself to conduct it according to the rules of art. <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:194749794?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-9794-0194"
                    />It is by neglecting tłiis that so many composers have erred. Their ideas are
                    no sooner given out than they are discussed. Thus their compositions leave no
                    permanent impression on the hearer."</p>
                <p part="N">The composer must be thoroughly versed in all kinds of counterpoint, and
                    generally in the whole theoretical and practical mechanism of his art. For such
                    instruction we refer to Music, and other articles relating to musical science,
                    in this work. In conclusion, we may remark, that nothing conduces so
                    beneficially in forming an accomplished composer, as a careful and diligent
                    study and practice of the <hi rend="italic">fugue,</hi> which, as remarked by
                    Reicha in his <hi rend="italic">Traité de Mélodie,</hi> will teach him, <hi
                        rend="italic">first,</hi> to give every possible variety to passages; <hi
                        rend="italic">secondly,</hi> to modulate with accuracy; <hi rend="italic"
                        >thirdly,</hi> to develope his ideas in every beautiful form; and, <hi
                        rend="italic">lastly,</hi> to preserve the strictest unity in his
                    compositions. It was by a profound conception of the genius of the fugue that
                    Handel and Haydn acquired such distinguished proficiency in music; and it is to
                    it that we are consequently indebted for a great proportion of the most sublime
                    produetions of these two illustrious composers.</p>

                    figures, the choice of attitudes, and so forth. Composition, therefore, consists
                    of two parts; one of which finds out, by means of history, proper objects for a
