                    preserving the memory of the number of soldiers, and of the order observed in
                    any military expedition. They had another kind of military column, which they
                    called <hi rend="italic">columna bellica,</hi> standing before the temple of
                    Janus, at the foot of which the consul declared war by throwing a javelin

                    was a column of marble raised by order of Augustus in the middle of the Roman
                    forum, and whence, as a centre, the distances of the several cities and stations
                    of the empire were reckoned, by other milliary columns disposed at equal
                    distances on all the great roads. This column was of white marble, the same with
                    that which is now seen on the balustrade of an edifice in the capitol at Rome.
                    Its proportion is massive, being a short cylinder, the symbol of the globe of
                    the earth. It was called <hi rend="italic">milliarium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >aureum,</hi> as having been gilt, at least the ball, by order of Augustus.
