                    learned prelate, and principal pillar of the Reformation, was born at Whaddon in
                    Buckinghamshire, in the year 1499. From Eton school he went to Cambridge, where
                    he obtained a scholarship in King’s College, of which he became a fellow in
                    1519. He was thence invited to Oxford by Cardinal Wolsey, and was there made one
                    of the junior canons of Cardinal College. In 1525 he was incorporated bachelor,
                    and the following year he took the degree of master of arts in the same
                    university. In this situation he became remarkable for his learning and poetical
                    abilities; but his attachment to the opinions of Luther rendered him hateful to
                    his superiors, who stripped him of his preferment, and threw him into prison on
                    a suspicion of heresy. Being, however, soon released, he was chosen master
                    ofEton school, which flourished remarkably under his care. In 1537 he commenced
                    doctor of divinity at Cambridge; in 1540 was made archdeacon of Ely; and in the
                    following year be became prebendary of that cathedral, on its being founded of
                    new by King Henry VIII. In 1546 he was made dean of Christ Church, Oxford. By
                    the recommendation of Archbishop Cranmer and Bishop Goodrich, to the latter of
                    whom he had been chaplain, he not only obtained the above preferments, but was
                    also chosen preceptor to Prince Edward,, on whose accession to the throne he
                    became a favourite at court, was sworn of the privy council, and made king’s
                    almoner. In 1547 he was elected chancellor of Oxford, in 1548 canon <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> Windsor, and the next year dean of Westminster. About
                    this time he was appointed one of the commissioners to visit the university of
                    Oxford; in which office his zeal for reformation was so excessive that he
                    destroyed a number of curious and valuable books, for no better reason than
                    because they were written by Roman Catholics. On the accession of Queen Mary he
                    was stripped of all his preferments, and committed to the Marshalsea. He was,
                    however, soon released, and immediately left the kingdom. Having resided some
                    time at Strasburg with his intimate friend Peter Martyr, he returned to England
                    on the death of Queen Mary, and, with other divines, he was appointed to revise
                    the liturgy. He often preached before the queen; and in 1559 he was preferred to
                    the see of Ely, which he continued to enjoy upwards of twenty-one years. He was,
                    however, no favourite with the queen; the reason assigned for which was, his
                    zealous opposition to her retaining the crucifix and wax candles on the altar of
                    the royal chapel, and his strenuous defence of the marriage of the clergy, which
                    her majesty always disapproved. He died on the 22d of July 1581, aged
                    eighty-one. He was a man of considerable learning, a zealous and rigid bulwark
                    of the church of England, and an implacable enemy of both Papists and Puritans.
                    In a letter to Archbishop Parker, he advises him to proceed vigorously in
                    reclaiming or punishing the Puritans, and not to be discouraged by the frown of
                    the court favourites who protected them; assuring him that he might expect the
                    blessing of God on his pious labours to free the church from their dangerous
                    attempts, and to establish uniformity. This zealous reformer we find had not
                    totally lost sight of the text, “Compel them to come in but a stronger proof of
                    his implacability and self-importance appears in his letter to the lord
                    treasurer Burghley, in which he warmly expostulates with the council for
                    interposing in behalf of the Puritans, or meddling in affairs of the church,
                    admonishing them to keep to their own sphere. ∙ Such language from a bishop
                    would probably make a modem privy council stare. His works are, 1. Two Latin
                    Orations on the Dispute between Dr Tresham and Peter Martyr, Lond. 1549, 4to; 2.
                    Liturgy of the Church of England, in compiling, and afterwards correcting which,
                    he was principally concerned; 3. The Lord’s Prayer in Verse, commonly printed at
                    the end of David’s Psalms by Sternhold and Hopkins; 4. Translation of the Four
                    Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Epistle to the Romans, in the new
                    translation of the Bible in the reign of Queen Elizabeth; 5. Resolutions of some
                    Questions concerning the Sacrament in the Collection of Records at the end of
                    Burnet’s History of the Reformation; 6. Several Letters to the Queen and others,
                    published in Strype’s Annals of the Reformation. He is also said to have been
                    concerned in framing the declaration concerning the divine institution of
                    bishops, and to have assisted Lyle in his Grammar.</p>
