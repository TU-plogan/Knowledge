                    of the leaves, are of a pure white, and have a very grateful odour. The fruit,
                    which is the only useful part, resembles a cherry. When it comes to be of a deep
                    red, it is gathered for the mill, in order to be manufactured into those <hi
                        rend="italic">coffee-beans</hi> now so generally known. The mill is composed
                    of two wooden rollers, furnished with iron plates eighteen inches long and ten
                    or twelve in diameter. These movable rollers are made to approach a third, which
                    is fixed, and which is called the <hi rend="italic">chops.</hi> Above the
                    rollers is a hopper, in which is put the coffee, whence it falls between the
                    rollers and the chops, where it is stripped of its first skin, and divided into
                    two parts, as may be seen by its form after it has undergone this operation,
                    being flat on the one side and round on the other. From this machine it falls
                    into a brass sieve, where the skin drops between the wires, while the fruit
                    slides over them into baskets placed ready to receive it. It is then thrown into
                    a vessel full of water, where it soaks for one night, and is afterwards
                    thoroughly washed. When the whole is finished and well dried, it is put into
                    another machine called the <hi rend="italic">peeling-mill.</hi> This is a wooden
                    grinder, turned vertically upon its trundle by a mule or horse. In passing over
                    the coffee it takes off the parchment, or thin skin, which detaches itself from
                    the berry in proportion as it grows dry. The parchment being removed, it is
                    taken out of this mill to be put into another, which is called the <hi
                        rend="italic">winnowing-mill.</hi> This machine is provided with four pieces
                    of tin fixed upon an axle, which is turned by a slave with considerable force;
                    and the wind produced by the motion of these plates clears the coffee of all the
                    pellicles that are mixed with it. It is afterwards put upon a table, where <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:194747480?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-7480-0018"
                    />the broken berries, and any filth that may remain among them, are separated by
                    negroes; after whieh the eoffee is fit for sale.</p>
                <p part="N">The coffee-tree is cultivated in Arabia, Persia, the East Indies, the
                    Isle of Bourbon, and several parts of America and the West Indies. It is also
                    raised in botaníe gardens in several parts of Europe. It delights particularly
                    in hills and mountains, where its root is almost always dry, and its head
                    frequently watered with gentle showers <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> It prefers a
                    western aspeet, and ploughed ground without any appearance of grass. The plants
                    should be plaeed at eight feet distanee from eaeh other, and in holes twelve or
                    fifteen feet deep. If left to themselves, they would, as already observed, rise
                    to the height of sixteen or eighteen feet; but they are generally stinted to
                    five, for the convenience of gathering their fruit with the greater ease. Thus
                    dwarfed, they extend their branches so that they cover the whole spot round
                    about them; and they begin to yield fruit the third year, but are not in full
                    bearing till the fifth. With the same infirmities that most other trees are
                    subjeet to, they are likewise in danger of being destroyed by a worm, or by the
                    scorehing rays of the sun. The hills where the eoffee-trees are found have
                    generally a gravelly or ehalky bottom. In the latter soil it languishes for some
                    time and then dies; in the former, its roots, which seldom fail to strike
                    between stones, obtain nourishment, and keep the tree alive and fruitful for
                    thirty years. This is nearly the period for plants of the eoffee-tree. The
                    proprietor, at the end of this period, not only finds himself without trees, but
                    has his land so reduced that it is not fit for any kind of culture; and unless
                    he be so situated that he can break up a spot of virgin land, to make himself
                    amends for that whieh is totally exhausted by the coffee-trees, his loss is
                    irreparable.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Coffee</hi> also denotes the drink prepared from
                    these berries, whieh has been familiar in Europe for a hundred years, and among
                    the Turks for a hundred and seventy.</p>
                <p part="N">Its origin is not well known. Some aseribe it to the prior of a
                    monastery, who being informed by a goatherd that his cattle, when they happened
                    to browse on the tree, remained awake and capered all night, beeame curious to
                    prove its virtue; and accordingly he first tried it on his monks, to prevent
                    their sleeping at matins. Others, following Schehabeddin, refer the invention of
                    eoffee to the Persians, from whom it was learned in the fifteenth eentury by
                    Gemaleddin, mufti of Aden, a eity near the mouth of the Red Sea, and who having
                    tried its virtues himself, and found that it dissipated the fumes which
                    oppressed the head, inspired joy, opened the bowels, and prevented sleep,
                    without producing any countervailing inconvenience, first recommended it to his
                    dervises, with whom he used to spend the night in prayer; and their example
                    brought coffee into vogue at Aden; the professors of the law, artisans,
                    travellers, in short, every body at Aden, drinking coffee. It next passed to
                    Mecca, where the devotees first, then the rest of the people, took coffee. From
                    Arabia Felix it passed to Cairo; and in 1511, Kahie Beg prohibited it, from a
                    persuasion that it inebriated, and inelined to things forbidden; but Sultan
                    Causon immediately after removed the prohibition, and coffee advanced from Egypt
                    to Syria and Constantinople. The dervises declaimed against it from the Alcoran,
                    whieh declares that eoal is not of the number of things ereated by God for food;
                    and the mufti accordingly ordered the eoffee-houses to be shut; but his
                    successor declaring coffee not to be <hi rend="italic">coal,</hi> they were
                    again opened. During the war in Candia, the assemblies of newsmongers making too
                    free with state affairs, the grand visier Cuproli suppressed the coffeehouses at
                    Constantinople; but this did not prevent the public from using this beverage;
                    and it has ever since been tolerated, if not legalised. Thevenot the traveller
                    was the first who brought it into Franee; and a Greek servant, named Pasqua,
                    brought into England by Mr Daniel Edwards, a Turkey merchant, in 1652, first
                    commenced the profession of <hi rend="italic">coffee-man,</hi> and introduced
                    the beverage into this island.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Coffee Trade.</hi> From the great increase in the
                    consumption of eoffee in this as well as in other countries, the value of the
                    article, the amount of eapital and labour employed in its production, and the
                    quantity of shipping required for its transport, it has beeome a commodity of
                    great eommereial importance. The duties which have been levied upon it have
                    varied considerably at different periods. In 1819 the duty was raised from
                    sevenpenee to one shilling per lb.; and the quantity entered for home
                    consumption in 1824 was 7,993,041 lbs., yielding a revenue of L. 407,544. 4s.
                    3d. In 1824, however, the duty was lowered to sixpence per lb., and the quantity
                    entered for home consumption, in 1825, was 10,766,112 lbs. In 1828 it increased
                    to 16,522,422 lbs., and at present may be estimated at 22,000,000 lbs.,
                    producing a revenue of about L. 580,000. In the year ending January 1831, the
                    quantity imported into the united kingdom from all parts was 40,952,163 lbs.,
                    and the quantity exported to all parts 20,087,994 lbs. The following is an
                    estimate of the annual exports of eoffee from the principal plaees where it is
                    produced, and of its annual consumption in those countries into whieh it is
                    imported from abroad at the present time:</p>
                <p part="N">The diserepaney here between the supply and the demand is in some
                    measure to be accounted for from the eireumstanee that we are without the means
                    of arriving at very aeeurate conclusions, either as to the supply or the
                    consumption of coffee. The above, however, is as close an approximation to the
                    truth as can be obtained.</p>
