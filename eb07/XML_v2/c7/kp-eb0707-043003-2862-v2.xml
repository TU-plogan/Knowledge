                <p part="N"><label type="entry">COUNT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Comes</hi></label>, a
                    nobleman who possesses a domain erected into a county. English and Scottish
                    counts we distinguish by the title of Earls; foreign ones still retain their
                    proper designation. The dignity of count is intermediate between that of duke
                    and baron. According to the modern use, most plenipotentiaries and ambassadors
                    assume the title of counts though they have no county. Anciently, all generals,
                    counsellors, judges, and secretaries of cities under Charlemagne were called
                    counts; the distinguishing character of a duke and count being this, that the
                    latter had but one town under him, whereas the former had several.</p>
                <p part="N">A count has a right to bear on his arms a coronet, adorned with three
                    precious stones, and surmounted with three large pearls, those in the middle and
                    extremities of the coronet advancing above the rest.</p>
                <p part="N">Counts were originally lords of the court, or of the emperor’s retinue,
                    and bad their name of <hi rend="italic">comites</hi> either <hi rend="italic"
                        >α</hi><hi rend="italic">comitando</hi> or <hi rend="italic">a

                    the palace, or at the emperor’s side, were called <hi rend="italic">counts
                        palatine,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">comites a latere.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">In the times of the commonwealth, <hi rend="italic">comites</hi> among
                    the Romans was a general name for all those who accompanied the proconsuls and
                    propraetors into the provinces, there to serve the commonwealth; as the
                    tribunes, prefects, scribes, and others.</p>
                <p part="N">Under the emperors, <hi rend="italic">comites</hi> were the officers of
                    the palace. The origin of what we now call counts seems to date from the time of
                    Augustus, who took several senators as his <hi rend="italic">comites,</hi> that
                    is, to accompany him in his voyages and travels, and to assist him in the
                    hearing of causes, which were thus judged with the same authority as in full
                    senate. But Gallienus seems to have abolished this council, by forbidding the
                    senators to appear in the armies; and none of his successors re-established
                    it.</p>
                <p part="N">These counsellors of the emperor were really counts, <hi rend="italic"
                        >comites,</hi> or companions of the prince; and they sometimes took the
                    title accordingly, but always with the addition of the name of the emperor whom
                    they accompanied; so that it was rather a mark of their office than a title of
                    dignity. Constantine was the first who converted it into a dignity, and under
                    him the name was first given absolutely. But the title being once established,
                    it was in a little time indifferently conferred, not only on those who followed
                    the court, and accompanied the emperor, but also on most kinds of officers, a
                    long list of whom is given by Du Cange.</p>
                <p part="N">Eusebius tells us that Constantine divided the counts into three
                    classes: the first bore the title of <hi rend="italic">illustres;</hi> the
                    second that of <hi rend="italic">clarissimi,</hi> and afterwards <hi
                        rend="italic">spectabiles;</hi> whilst the third were called <hi
                        rend="italic">perfectissimi.</hi> Of the first two classes the senate was
                    composed; those of the third had no place in the senate, but enjoyed several
                    other of the privileges of senators.</p>
                <p part="N">There were counts who served on land, and others aťsea; some in a civil,
                    some in a religious, and some in a legal capacity; as <hi rend="italic"

                    and so on'.</p>
                <p part="N">The Franks, Germans, and other nations, on passing into Gaul and
                    Germany, did not abolish the form of the Roman government; and as the governors
                    of cities and provinces were called counts, <hi rend="italic">comites,</hi> and
                    dukes, <hi rend="italic">duces,</hi> they continued to be so designated. They
                    commanded during war, and in time of peace they administered justice. Thus,
                    under Charlemagne, counts were the ordinary judges and governors of the
                    cities.</p>
                <p part="N">These counts of cities rankedbelow the dukes and counts who presided
                    over provinces. The counts of provinces were in nothing inferior to dukes, who
                    themselves were only governors of provinces. Under the last of the second race
                    of French kings, their dignity was rendered hereditary, and they even usurped
                    the sovereignty. When Hugh Capet came to the crown, his authority was not
                    sufficient to oppose their encroachments; and hence it is that they date the
                    privilege of wearing coronets in their arms. They assumed it then, as enjoying
                    the rights of sovereigns in their particular districts or counties; but by
                    degrees most of the counties became reunited to the crown.</p>
                <p part="N">The quality of count has now become very different from what it was
                    anciently, being no more than a title, which a king grants upon erecting a
                    territory into a county, with a reserve of jurisdiction and sovereignty to
                    himself. At first there was no clause in the patent of erection intimating the
                    reversion of the county to the crown in default of heirs male; but Charles IX.
                    to prevent their being too numerous, ordained that duchies and counties, in
                    default of heirs male, should revert to the crown.</p>
                <p part="N">The point of precedence between counts and marquises was formerly much
                    controverted; and the reason was, that there were counts who were peers of
                    France, but no marquises. The point, however, was given up, and marquises took
                    precedence; although anciently, when counts were governors of provinces, they
                    were on a level even with dukes.</p>
                <p part="N">William the Conqueror, as is observed by Camden, gave the dignity of
                    counts in fee to his nobles, annexing it to this or that county or province, and
                    allotting for their maintenance a certain proportion of money arising from the
                    prince’s profits in the pleadings and forfeitures of the provinces.</p>
                <p part="N">The Germans call a count <hi rend="italic">graaf</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">graff,</hi> which properly signifiesjw¢¾’e, and is derived
                    from <hi rend="italic">gravio</hi> or <hi rend="italic">graffio,</hi> formed 1
                    from ygαpω, <hi rend="italic">I write.</hi> They have several kinds of counts or
                    graffs, as land-graves, march-graves, burg-graves, and palsgraves or counts
                    palatine. These last are of two kinds; the one of the number of princes, with
                    the investiture of a palatinate, while the others have only the title of count
                    palatine, without the investiture of any palatinate. Some assert that, by
                    publicly professing the imperial laws for twenty years, a person acquires the
                    title of count palatine; and there are instances of professors in law who have
                    assumed the title accordingly; but this right has been much disputed.</p>
