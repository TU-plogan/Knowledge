                    Fusignano, near Imola, in the territory of Bologna, in February 1653. He
                    received his first instructions in counterpart from Matteo Simonelli of the
                    Papal chapel; and, entertaining an early inclination for the violin, he was put
                    under Bassani, a master of that instrument, at Bologna. Having completed his
                    musical studies, in which he rapidly acquired uncommon proficiency, Corelli
                    visited Germany, and was retained in the service of the Duke of Bavaria. He

                    settled at Rome, where he composed hĩs first twelve sonatas, and became leader

                    throughout all Europe, and many persons went to Rome to study under the greatest
                    master on the violin who had then been heard of. In 1685 he published his second
                    set of sonatas, which he entitled <hi rend="italic">Balletti di Camera.</hi> In
                    1690, his third, and in 1694 his fourth operas appeared. Of these four sets of
                    sonatas, which are written as trios for two violins and violoncello, with an
                    additional part for the organ, the third is generally accounted the best, but
                    all of them are remarkable for ingenious contrivance. Corelli subsequently gave
                    to the world his <hi rend="italic">Concerti</hi><hi rend="italic">grossi,</hi>
                    and other well known and highly esteemed works; but the most celebrated of all
                    his productions, and that by which he acquired the greatest reputation during
                    his lifetime, was his <hi rend="italic">Solos,</hi> composed in 1700, which have
                    been long and justly regarded as the foundation of all good schools for the
                    violin, and are said to have cost him three years to revise and correct
                    them.</p>
                <p part="N">During his residence at Rome, Corelli enjoyed the favour and patronage
                    of Cardinal Ottoboni, the general encourager of polite arts and learning, at
                    whose house he became acquainted with the celebrated Handel. Cres-cembini
                    informs us, that he led an <hi rend="italic">academia</hi> or concert given by
                    the cardinal every Monday evening; and having been appointed permanent director
                    of music, he continued to reside in the palace of his patron till the day of his
                    death, which happened on the 18th of January 1713. He was buried in the church
                    of the Rotunda or Pantheon, in the first chapel on the left hand of the entrance
                    of that beautiful temple, where a monument, with a marble bust on it, was
                    erected near that of the great painter Raffaelle, by Philip William, count
                    palatine of the Rhine, under the care of Cardinal Ottoboni. For many years after
                    his decease he was commemorated by a solemn service, consisting of pieces
                    selected from his own works, on the anniversary of his death; a solemnity which
                    continued as long as his immediate scholars survived to conduct and perform in
                    it. A bust was also erected to his memory, in the Vatican, with this
                    inscription: <hi rend="italic">Corelli</hi><hi rend="italic">princeps
                        Musicorum.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Corelli was a passionate admirer of pictures, and lived in an
                    uninterrupted friendship with Carlo Cignani and Carlo Marati, who were rivals
                    for his favour, and for a series of years presented him at times with pictures,
                    as well of their own as of other masters. He thus became possessed of a large
                    and valuable collection of original paintings, which, together with about L.6000
                    in money, be bequeathed to his friend and patron Cardinal Ottoboni, who,
                    reserving the pictures to himself, generously distributed the rest of his
                    effects among the relations of the testator.</p>
                <p part="N">Of the private life and moral character of the composer little
                    information has been preserved; “but,” as Dr Burney remarks, “if we may judge of
                    his equanimity and natural disposition, by the mildness, sweetness, and even
                    tenor of his musical ideas, his temper must have endeared him to all his
                    acquaintance, as much as his talents.” He was not, however, insensible of his
                    acquirements, as we are told that on one occasion, while playing a solo at
                    Cardinal Ottoboni’s, having remarked the cardinal and another person engaged in
                    discourse, he immediately laid down his instrument; and being asked the reason,
                    replied, that he feared the music interrupted their conversation.</p>
                <p part="N">The compositions of Corelli are distinguished no less for elegance and
                    purity of melody, than for the harmony which results from the music of the
                    several parts. His talents were displayed to advantage in the most solemn, as
                    well as in the most lively style. Several of his movements are referred to by
                    musicians as quite perfect in their kind. His <hi rend="italic">allemands</hi>
                    are remarkable for spirit, force, and delicacy; his <hi rend="italic">gigas</hi>
                    are gay and sprightly; and his <hi rend="italic">adagios</hi> are expressive and
                    imposing. Some difference exists among modern musicians as to the manner of
                    executing the compositions of Corelli, particularly when they admit of extempore
                    ornament from the performer. On this point, however, we have the authority of an
                    English musical gentleman, who heard them performed at Rome by the scholars of
                    the master, for asserting that his works ought to be played in a slow, firm, and
                    distinct manner, just as they are written, and without changing the passages in
                    the way of embellishment.</p>
                <p part="N">Geminiani’s estimate of the character of Corelli as a composer is upon
                    the whole a just one. “His merit,” says he, “was not depth of learning, like
                    that of Scarlatti; nor great fancy, or rich invention in melody or harmony; but
                    a nice ear and most delicate taste, which led him to select the most pleasing
                    harmonies and melodies, and to construct the parts so as to produce the most
                    delightful effect upon the ear.” It is indeed, we may add, in their peculiarly
                    beautiful construction, that the charm of Corelli's compositions chiefly
                    consists. Taken as a whole, they do not display great inventive power; and all
                    the varieties in harmony, modulation, and melody they contain, might be
                    comprised in a narrow compass; but by an inimitable combination, or, as we may
                    term it, dovetailing of the parts, the composer has succeeded in producing
                    effects which, while they give a character of inexpressible fascination to his
                    music, have rendered it impregnable against the attacks of time and fashion.
                    Notwithstanding the striking changes that have been wrought upon musical art
                    during the last century, the tasteful musician looks with reverence and respect
                    on the time-honoured compositions of Corelli. Unfaded in worth, they are still
                    continually resorted to as the primitive but pure and copious emanations of a
                    refined and skilful genius, which has exercised no mean influence over the
                    progress of musical science to its present highly cultivated state. (z. z.)</p>
