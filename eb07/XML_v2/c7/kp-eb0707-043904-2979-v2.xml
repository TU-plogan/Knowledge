                    was born at Aldborough, in Suffolk, on the 24th December 1754, and was the son
                    of an officer of the customs. He appears to have been designed by his father
                    first for an employment similar to his own, and afterwards for the medical
                    profession. He was apprenticed to an apothecary, and received an education
                    merely sufficient to qualify him for such an occupation, and by no means to
                    advance him in that literary career in which he became eventually distinguished.
                    His poetical taste was first elicited by the casual perusal of some verses in
                    the Philosophical Magazine, which his father, who was a mathematician, and
                    averse to poetry, had separated from the scientific portions of that periodical,
                    and thrown aside as unworthy. The spark thus kindled burnt steadily; and even
                    while a schoolboy he versified much, and made sundry ambitious attempts in the
                    highest walks of composition. The attainment of a prize offered by the editor of
                    the Lady’s Magazine, for a poem on Hope, although a humble species of success,
                    sufficed to encourage him to renewed exertions; and in 1778 he quitted the
                    profession of medicine, which he had always disliked, and repaired to London,
                    determining to apply himself to literature. His early efforts in his new career
                    were attended with disheartening circumstances. The first poem he offered for
                    publication could find no publisher. From the first that was printed he obtained
                    no profit, in consequence of the publisher’s bankruptcy. It was entitled <hi

                        Monthly Reιdeιv,</hi> and appeared anonymously in 1780. Soon afterwards he
                    became acquainted with Mr Burke, an acquaintance from which may be dated the
                    dawn of his literary rise. Without an introduction, impelled by distress, he
                    applied to 'Mr Burke, who kindly took him by the hand, afforded him the
                    advantage of his criticism and advice, recom-I mended him to Dodsley the
                    publisher, invited him to his house, and made him known to many distinguished
                    men 'of that time, among whom were Reynolds, Johnson, and Fox. Crabbe’s first
                    published poems, after the commencement of his acquaintance with Burke, were,
                        <hi rend="italic">The Library,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Village,</hi>
                    both of which received the benefit of iBurke’s observations, and the second of
                    which was in a great measure composed at Beaconsfield. In 1781 Crabbe, ∣who by
                    the recommendation of Burke had been qualifying himself for holy orders, was
                    ordained a deacon, and took priest’s orders the following year. Through the
                    influence of this generous and distinguished friend, he, after serving a short
                    time as curate at Aldborough, was introduced to the Duke of Rutland, and became
                    his domestic chaplain. Nor did Burke’s kindness stop here; for he obtained for
                    him from Lord Thurlow, in 1783, a presentation to the rectory of Frome St
                    Quentin, in Dorsetshire, which he held for six years. About this time he
                    married, and resided for some time at Swefiing, county of Suffolk, officiating
                    as curate to the minister of Great Yarmouth. About 1789 he was presented,
                    through the instrumentality of the Duchess of Rutland, to the rectories of
                    Muston in Leicestershire, and West Allington in Lincolnshire. In 1813 he was
                    preferred to the rectory of Trowbridge, county of Wilts, which, together with
                    the smaller living of Croxton Kerrycl, in Leicestershire, lie held to the time
                    of his death. After <hi rend="italic">The Village,</hi> published in 1783, which
                    had received the corrections and commendations <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Dr
                    Johnson, Crabbe next produced <hi rend="italic">The Newspaper,</hi> published in
                    1785. After this time his poetical labours were long suspended, owing probably
                    to the dedication of his time to the care of a family and the duties of his
                    profession, or, as he himself ascribes it, to the loss of those early and
                    distinguished friends who had given him the benefit of their criticism. He had,
                    however, the satisfaction of seeing his next work, <hi rend="italic">The Parish
                        Register,</hi> published in 1809, read and approved by Fox. The success
                    obtained by these poems, which far exceeded that which had attended his earlier
                    efforts, encouraged him to write again; and in 1810 he published onc of his best
                    poems, <hi rend="italic">The Borough,</hi> and in 1812, <hi rend="italic">Tales
                        in Verse.</hi> His last publication was entitled <hi rend="italic">Tales of
                        the Hall,</hi> and appeared in 1819. The latter years of his life he spent
                    in the tranquil and amiable exercise <hi rend="italic">of</hi> his domestic and
                    clerical duties, at his rectory of Trowbridge, esteemed and admired by his
                    parishioners, among whom he died, after a short illness, on the 8th February
                    1832, aged seventy-seven, and was.buried in the chancel of Trowbridge church. Mr
                    Crabbe’s only prose publications were, a <hi rend="italic">Funeral Sermon on
                        Charles l)uke of Rutland,</hi> preached at Beloni, and an Essay on the
                    Natural History of the Vale of Beloni, written for Nichols’ <hi rend="italic"
                        >History of Leicestershire,</hi> in which it is thankfully acknowledged. His
                    fame rests solely on his poems, of which <hi rend="italic">The Parish
                        Register</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Borough</hi> are destined to a
                    reputation, if not as brilliant, yet probably as enduring, as that of any other
                    contemporary productions.</p>
                <p part="N">Crabbe is one of the most original of our poets; and his originality is
                    of that best kind, which displays itself not in tumid exaggeration or flighty
                    extravagance,—not in a wide departure from the sober standard of truth,—but in a
                    more rigid and uncompromising adherence to it than inferior writers venture to
                    attempt. He is pre-eminently the poet of reality in humble life; and to its
                    representation he has applied himself with a rigorous fidelity, which startled
                    the timid· fastidiousness of many readers. He discarded the aid of those
                    pleasing illusions with whieh huιfi-ble life had previously been enveloped;
                    condemned aś fictitious the prevalent representations, and in their stead
                    fearlessly exhibited the stern, harsh, naked truth, and determined to rely for
                    popularity on the fidelity and vigour of his delineations. His chief
                    characteristics are force and accuracy; and through these, and the originality
                    of his style, he compels us to bestow our attention on objects that are usually
                    neglected. His poetry, unlike, that of others, directs our sympathy where it is
                    well for the cause of humanity that it should be directed, but whence the
                    squalidness of misery and want too frequently repels it. Much of his success
                    arises from his graphic delineation of external objects, but more from his
                    knowledge of the human heart, and his powerful treatment of the passions. Both
                    the milder and the more violent emotions are pourtrayed with ability, but in the
                    latter he is most strikingly successful. Despair and remorse are exhibited with
                    a tragic strength that has been rarely equalled; and madness has been seldom
                    drawn with a more powerful hand than in his poem of <hi rend="italic">Sir
                        Eustace Grey.</hi> He has been called the satirist of the poor; but we must
                    be careful lest we attach to this expression too harsh an acceptation. It is
                    true, he discountenances those romantic day-dreams which associate virtue
                    inseparably with poverty, and an Arcadian innocence<pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194752992?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2992-0440"/> with rural
                    life. He shows that demoralization is the attendant of distress, and that
                    villagers may be equally dissipated and more dishonest than the profligates of a
                    wealthier class; but he shows this in a spirit rather of pity than of anger; and
                    whilst he denounces and exposes crime, he makes us interested, not so much in
                    its punishment, as, what is still better, in its prevention. He spares not the
                    vices of the poorer classes; but at the same time he does more justice to thejr
                    virtues, and renders them more important objects of consideration, than perhaps
                    any other imaginative writer.</p>
                <p part="N">With many sterling merits as a poet, Crabbe has numerous defects. His
                    descriptions are forcible and exact, but they are too detailed. They have too
                    much of the minuteness of a Dutch picture; and it is a minuteness exhibited in
                    the representation of disgusting objects. He never shrinks from the irksome task
                    of threading the details of vice and misery. Abject depravity is a too favoured
                    subject of his pen; and he does not seem sufficiently aware, that there is a
                    species of wickedness which counteracts our sympathy with suffering, and a
                    degree of insignificance which extinguishes our interest in guilt. His skill in
                    displaying the morbid anatomy of our moral nature, has rendered him too prone to
                    that unplcasing exercise of his talents; and his habit of tracing the
                    deformities of character have given to his expositions too much the appearance
                        <hi rend="italic">of</hi> invective. His taste is very inferior to his other
                    powers. Even with subjects naturally pleasing, he is apt to blend disagreeable
                    images. His descriptions of natural scenery, graphic as they are, have little in
                    them of elevation. There is no genial glow about them, as if the contemplation
                    of nature had warmed and inspired him. His deficiency of taste displays itself
                    also sometimes in his humour, which is apt to verge upon buffoonery. His style
                    is little to be commended. It is too often clumsy and ungraceful; diffuse
                    without freedom, homely without being easy, and antithetical without being
                    pointed. His diction is frequently harsh and quaint, and compels us to feel that
                    the merit of his works resides rather in their ideas than in the dress in which
                    he clothes them. His lines are deficient in refinement and polish, and
                    frequently offend the ear by something uncouth and prosaic in the sound, and the
                    absence <hi rend="italic">of</hi> musical rhythm. Such are the defects which
                    have conduced to deprive him of that popularity which his merits would otherwise
                    have obtained for him. (γ. γ.)</p>
