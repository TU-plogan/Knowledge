                <p part="N"><label type="entry">COLBERT, <hi rend="smallcaps">John
                        Baptiste</hi></label>, Marquis of Segnelay, one of the greatest statesmen
                    whom France ever produced, was born at Paris in 1619, and descended from a
                    respectable family which lived at Rheims in Champagne. His grandfather is said
                    to have been a wine merchant, and his father at first followed the same
                    occupation, but afterwards became clerk to a notary. In 1648, his relation John
                    Baptiste Colbert, lord of St Pouange, preferred him to the service of Le
                    Tellier, secretary of state, whose sister he had married; and here he discovered
                    such diligence and exactness in executing all the commissions which were
                    intrusted to his care, that he quickly became distinguished. One day his master
                    sent him to Cardinal Mazarin, who was then at Sedan, with a letter written by
                    the queen mother, and ordered him to bring it back after that minister had seen
                    it. Colbert carried the letter, and refused to return without it, though the
                    cardinal treated him roughly, used several arts to deceive him, and obliged him
                    to wait for it several days. Some time afterwards, when the cardinal returned to
                    court, and found himself in want of a secretary or amanuensis, he desired Le
                    Tellier to furnish him with a fit person for that employment; and Colbert having
                    been presented to him, the cardinal, who had some remembrance of the young man,
                    desired to know where he had seen him. Colbert was afraid of putting his
                    eminence in mind of Sedan, lest the recollection of his importunacy, in
                    demanding the queen’s letter, should renew the cardinal’s anger; but the
                    cardinal, who divined character better than any man of his time, was so far from
                    disliking him for his fidelity to his former master, that he received him on
                    condition that he should serve him with equal zeal and devotion.</p>
                <p part="N">Colbert applied himself wholly to the advancement of his master’s
                    interests, and gave so many marks of his diligence and skill, that the cardinal
                    afterwards made him his intendant. And he accommodated himself so dexterously to
                    the inclinations of the minister, by retrenching his superfluous expenses and
                    otherwise, that he was intrusted with the management of the gainful trade of
                    selling benefices and governments. It was by Colbert’s counsel that the cardinal
                    obliged the governors of frontier places to maintain their garrisons out of the
                    contributions they had exacted; a suggestion with which his eminence was
                    extremely pleased. He was sent to Rome to negotiate the reconciliation öf
                    Cardinal de Retz, for which the pope had showed some concern; and to persuade
                    his holiness to consent to the disincameration of Casto, according to the treaty
                    concluded with his predecessor Urban VIII. Upon the whole, Mazarin had so high
                    an opinion of Colbert’s abilities, and withal so strong a sense of his faithful
                    services, that at his death, which happened in 1661, he earnestly recommended
                    his protege to Louis XIV. as the most proper person to regulate the finances,
                    which at that time stood in great need of reformation. Louis accepted the
                    recommendation, and made Colbert intendant of the finances. The latter applied
                    himself to their regulation, and succeeded in his object, although it procured
                    him many enemies, and exposed him to some affronts. France is also indebted to
                    this minister for establishing her trade with the East and West Indies; a
                    project from which she derived innumerable advantages.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1664 Colbert became superintendent of buildings, and from that time
                    applied himself to the enlarging and adorning of the royal edifices, which
                    became masterpieces of architecture in their peculiar style; witness the palace
                    of the Thuilleries, the Louvre, St Germain, Fontainbleau, and Chambord. In the
                    same year he founded the Academy of Inscriptions, and in 1666 the still more
                    celebrated Academy of Sciences. France also owes to Colbert all the advantages
                    she has derived from the union of the two seas; a work begun in 1666, and
                    finished in 1680.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1669 Colbert was made secretary of state, and intrusted with the
                    management of naval affairs; and his services in this department were answerable
                    to the confidence his majesty reposed in him. He suppressed several offices,
                    which were chargeable, but useless; and perceiving the king’s zeal for the
                    extirpation of heresy, he shut up the chamber instituted by the edicts of Paris
                    and Rouen. He proposed several new regulations concerning criminal courts, and
                    was extremely severe to the parliament of Thoulouse for obstructing the measures
                    he took to carry these improvements into execution. His main design in reforming
                    the tedious methods of proceeding at law, was to give the people more leisure to
                    apply themselves to trade; for the advancement of which he procured an edict,
                    erecting a general insurance office at Paris for merchants and others» In 1672
                    he was appointed minister of state; but how busied soever he might be in the
                    regulation of public affairs, he never neglected his own or his family’s
                    interest and grandeur, nor missed any opportunity of advancing either. He had
                    been married many years, and had sons and daughters grown up, all of whom, as
                    occasion served, he took care to marry to great persons; for though he had no
                    reason to doubt of his master's favour, yet he wisely secured his fortune by
                    powerful alliances.</p>
                <p part="N">This great minister died of the stone, on the 6th September 1683, in his
                    sixty-fourth year, leaving behind him six sons and three daughters. In his last
                    moments he was attended by Bourdaloue; and w hen his wife attempted to talk to
                    him of public affairs, he repulsed her, saying, “Vous ne me laisserez donc pas
                    même le temps de mourir.” He was of a middle stature, his mien was low and
                    dejected, his air gioomy, and his aspect stern. He slept little, and was very
                    sober. He was of slow conception, but spoke judiciously of every thing after he
                    had once comprehended it. He filled the most important offices with high
                    reputation and credit; and his influence diffused itself throughout every
                    department of the government. Upon the whole, he was a wise, active,
                    public-spirited minister, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194748013?mode=fullsize"

                    happiness of the people, the progress of arts and manufactures, and, in short,
                    to every thing that could advance the credit and interest of his country. Though
                    an enlightened patron of science and literature, Colbert was not himself an
                    author. The work entitled <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Testament
