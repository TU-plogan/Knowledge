                <p part="N"><label type="entry">COIMBETOOR</label>, a small province in the south of
                    Hindustan, situated between the 10th and 12th degrees of north latitude. It is
                    bounded on the south by Dindigul, on the east by Salem and Kistnagherry, on the
                    north by Mysore, and on the west by the province of Malabar. This district is
                    divided into North and South Coimbetoor. The former is a highly cultivated and
                    productive country, where wells and reservoirs abound, and are rendered
                    subservient to the purposes of agriculture. Rice is the grain chiefly
                    cultivated; and the country also produces sugar, cotton, tobacco, &amp;c. To the
                    east, the Ghauts rise to the height of 1500 or 2000 feet above the level of the
                    upper country, which is better cultivated than in Mysore. The soil in many
                    places is very good; and the remains of many hedges, and traces of cultivation,
                    show not only that the whole country was once cultivated, but that it was
                    cultivated in a manner much superior to that which is now practised; but it has
                    been greatly injured by the devastations of war. When it was invaded by General
                    Meadows, cultivation came to a stand for two years; and all the grain in the
                    country was indiscriminately swept away by the defending and invading armies.
                    The inhabitants were driven to the hills, where they subsisted on grain produced
                    in places inaccessible to the military; but numbers died from misery and hunger,
                    and great part of the lower country was in a state of desolation.</p>
                <p part="N">Near to the town of Coimbetoor the soil is in general good, and
                    tolerably clear of rocks and stones. The waste fields do not appear to amount to
                    more than a half of those that are arable. There are few hedges, and still fewer
                    trees; but there is a good deal of rice ground watered by reservoirs. All kinds
                    of soil are also cultivated for gardens; and the value of the ground and the
                    rent which it pays are regulated by the depth of water which stands upon it. The
                    gardens produce betel and cocoa nut palms, also tobacco; but throughout the
                    whole province of Coimbetoor the wet cultivation is little more than three per
                    cent, of the total cultivation. In South Coimbetoor the rice grounds along the
                    banks of the Amaravati are extensive, and fully cultivated. Some earths are
                    found in this province impregnated with muriatic salts, and others with
                    nitrates. Much of the well water has also a saline taste.</p>
                <p part="N">The rains are usually considered as more regular and greater in quantity
                    above the Ghauts than below; Dr Buchanan, however, thinks that this is doubtful.
                    The westerly winds bring the heaviest rains, but the country below the Ghauts
                    enjoys a considerable portion of the rain from the other monsoon, which prevents
                    it from ever being parched up by drought. From April till about the middle of
                    June the winds are moderate, with a short interval of ten or fifteen days, when
                    violent squalls come from the westward, with thunder and lightning, heavy
                    showers, and hail. In the succeeding two months, for about ten days there are
                    heavy showers, with fogs on the hills, and in the interval the heat is moderate,
                    with cloudy weather. From about the middle of August till December there are
                    occasional heavy rains, and more temperate weather in the summer than is usual
                    in Hindustan; and in winter there are sometimes showers, with heavy dews, a very
                    cold air, and south-easterly winds. The spring is generally dry, with light
                    breezes from the south, and moderate dews. Fevers and fluxes are epidemic among
                    the inhabitants from about the middle of October.</p>
                <p part="N">Many sheep are bred in the country, of which there are two kinds; the
                    one short bodied, with a short small tail; the other of a thinner make, with
                    long ears and scanty wool. Though small, they are of good quality, fattening
                    readily, and making most delicious meat. The pasture, though it looks bare,
                    seems to be more nutritious than that on the banks of the Ganges. Here is also a
                    breed of goats; but they are very inferior to those which are reared above the
                    Ghauts. A good sheep costs only from 2s. lid. to 2s. 6d. The wild animals are
                    nearly the same as in other parts of India. In the hills there are many black
                    bears, which are harmless, living chiefly on white ants, wild fruit, and the
                    palmyra tree. They are dangerous when disturbed, and in this case often kill the
                    intruder, though they never devour him. They are very strong, and not afraid to
                    encounter the tiger.</p>
                <p part="N">The inhabitants of Coimbctoor have made little progress in the arts of
                    civil life, and are as far inferior to the people of Mysore in intelligence and
                    in mechanical knowledge as these are to the natives of Madras and Calcutta. The
                    only manufacture is that of weaving.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal towns are Coimbetoor Errood, and Caroor. At a place called
                    Perura is a celebrated Hindu temple, which is said to be 3000 years old. It is
                    highly ornamented with numerous figures, some of which are very indecent. This
                    temple, which is called Mail Chittumbra, was excepted by Tippoo, with two other
                    places, when he issued an order for the destruction of the Brahmin temples.
                    Coimbetoor was first annexed to Mysore about the year 1746. It was taken
                    possession of by the British in <pb break="no"

                    was restored to Tippoo at the conclusion of the war. It was again conquered by
                    the British in 1790, and was taken final possession of by them in 1799. Since
                    this period it has been governed by a European judge and collector under the
                    presidency of Madras.</p>

                        >Coimbetoor,</hi> a town of Hindustan, and capital of the province of the
                    same name. This city suffered deeply, along with the whole province, in the wars
                    which took place between the British and the Mysore sovereigns. Since it fell
                    into the hands of the English, the town has recovered considerably, and contains
                    2000 houses, which is considerably more than half the number it contained under
                    Hyder’s government. It has a mosque, built by Tippoo, who sometimes made
                    Coimbetoor the place of his residence. It is defended by a citadel or small
                    fort. It was conquered by the Mysore family about the year 1645, and the fort
                    was then enlarged. One of Hyder’s deputies built a house which is called by the
                    natives a palace, but is nothing better than an inconvenient pile of mud, and
                    now serves as a barrack for cavalry. The hereditary chief of Coimbetoor is of
                    the Vaylalar tribe. It was twice taken by the British; first in 1783, and
                    secondly in 1790. It was afterwards besieged by the troops of the sultan, who,
                    in an attempt to storm it, were repulsed by a weak garrison; but it subsequently
                    surrendered to Tippoo, who broke the capitulation and imprisoned the garrison.
                    It came permanently under the jurisdiction of the British in 1799. Long. 77. 6.
