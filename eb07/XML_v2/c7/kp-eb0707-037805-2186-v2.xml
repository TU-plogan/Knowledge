                    conqueror of Mexico, was bornât Medellin, a small town of Estremadura, in 1485.
                    He was descended from a noble family of decayed fortune, who destined him for
                    the bar, and sent him at an early age to the university of Salamanca. But being
                    soon disgusted with a species of study ill suited to his ardent genius, he
                    embraced the military profession, in hopes of signalizing himself, under the
                    celebrated Gonsalvo de Cordova. A dangerous malady, however, having prevented
                    his embarking for Naples, his hopes were baffled; but when his health was
                    re-established he turned his attention towards the West Indies, which were then
                    a source of riches and glory to the Spaniards. In 1504 Cortes set out for St
                    Domingo, where he was kindly received by Ovando, the governor. He was then only
                    nineteen, and remarkable for a graceful physiognomy and amiable manners, as well
                    as for skill and address in all military exercises. He remained in St Domingo,
                    where Ovando had successively conferred upon him several lucrative and
                    honourable employments, until 1511, when he accompanied Diego Velasquez in his
                    expedition to the island of Cuba, where he became alcalde of St Iago, and
                    displayed great talents on several trying occasions. To the fire and impetuosity
                    of youth had now succeeded an indefatigable activity, united with the coolness
                    and self-command which are so necessary for the execution of great designs.
                    Grijalva, lieutenant of Velasquez, had just discovered Mexico, but without
                    attempting to effect a settlement. This displeased the governor of Cuba, who
                    superseded Grijalva, and intrusted the conquest of the newly-discovered country
                    to Cortes. The latter hastened his preparations, and, on the 18th of November
                    1518, he set out from St Iago, with ten vessels, six or seven hundred Spaniards,
                    eighteen horsemen, and some pieces of cannon. Scarcely had he set sail, however,
                    when Velasquez, repenting his choice, and apprehensive that his lieutenant would
                    carry off all the glory as well as profit of the enterprise, recalled the
                    commission which he had granted to Cortes, and even ordered him to be put under
                    arrest; but the attachment of the troops, by whom he was greatly beloved,
                    enabled him to disconcert all the designs of the governor; and on the 4th of
                    March 1519 he landed on the coast of Mexico. Advancing along the gulf, sometimes
                    caressing the natives, and sometimes spreading terror by his arms, he took
                    possession of the town of Tabasco. The noise of the artillery, the appearance of
                    the floating fortresses which had transported the ∙ Spaniards over the ocean,
                    and the horses on which they fought, all new objects to the natives, inspired
                    them with astonishment mingled with terror and admiration; they regarded the
                    Spaniards as gods, and sent them ambassadors with presents. Cortes here learned
                    that the native sovereign was called Montezuma; that he reigned over an
                    extensive empire, which had lasted for three centuries,∙∣ that thirty vassals,
                    called caciques, obeyed him; that his riches were immense and his power
                    absolute. No more was necessary to inflame the ambition of Cortes, who hesitated
                    not to undertake the conquest of this great empire, which could only be effected
                    by combining stratagem and address with force and courage. He laid the
                    foundation of the town of Vera Cruz, caused himself to be elected
                    captain-general of the new colony, and, like Agathocles, burned his vessels, to
                    cut off the possibility of retreat, and <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi><pb

                    show his soldiers that they must cither conquer or perish. He then penetrated
                    into the interior of the country, drew to his camp several caciques hostile to
                    Montezuma, and induced these native princes to facilitate his progress. The
                    republic of Tlascala alone opposed him; but he routed its army, which had
                    resisted all the forces of the Mexican empire, dictated peace on moderate terms,
                    converted the people into powerful auxiliaries, and, surmounting all obstacles,
                    arrived, with six thousand natives and a handful of Spaniards, in sight of the
                    immense lake on which was built the city of Mexieo, the capital of the empire.
                    Montezuma received him with great pomp, and his subjects, believing Cortes to be
                    a descendant of the sun, prostrated themselves before him. The first care of
                    Cortes was to fortify himself in one of the beautiful palaces of the prince; and
                    he was only thinking how to get hold of the riches of so opulent an empire, when
                    intelligence reached him that a general of the emperor, who had received secret
                    orders, had just attacked the garrison <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Vera Cruz and
                    killed several of his soldiers. This event undeceived the Mexicans, who had
                    hitherto believed the Spaniards to be immortal, and overturned the whole policy
                    of Cortes. Struck with the greatness of the danger, surrounded by enemies, and
                    having only a handful of soldiers, he conceived and instantly executed a most
                    daring project. Having repaired with his officers to the palace of the emperor,
                    he announced to Montezuma that he must either accompany him or perish. Being
                    thus master of the person of the monarch, he then demanded that the Mexican
                    general and his officers who had attacked the Spaniards should be delivered into
                    his hands; and when this had been done he caused these unfortunate men, who had
                    only obeyed the orders of their sovereign, to be burned alive before the gates
                    of the imperial palace. During this cruel execution Cortes entered the apartment
                    of Montezuma, and caused him to be loaded w ith irons, in order to force him to
                    acknowledge himself a vassal <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Charles V. The unhappy
                    prince yielded, and was restored to a semblance of liberty on presenting the
                    fierce conqueror with six hundred thousand marks of pure gold, and a prodigious
                    quantity of precious stones. Scarcely had he reaped the fruits of his audacity,
                    however, when he was informed of the landing of a Spanish army, under Narvaez,
                    which had been sent by Velasquez to compel him to renounce his command. In this
                    emergency Cortes acted with his usual decision and courage. Leaving two hundred
                    men at Mexico, under the orders of his lieutenant, he marched against Narvaez,
                    whom he defeated and made prisoner, and then enlisted under his standard the
                    Spanish soldiers who had been sent to attack him. On his return to the capital,
                    however, he found that the Mexicans had revolted against the emperor and the
                    Spaniards, and that dangers thickened around him. Montezuma perished in
                    attempting toaddress his revolted subjects; upon which the latter, having chosen
                    a new emperor, attacked the headquarters of Cortes with the utmost fury, and, in
                    spite of the advantage of fire-arms, forced the Spaniards to retire, which alone
                    saved them from destruction. Their rearguard, however, was cut in pieces, and
                    they suffered severely during the retreat, which was continued during six days.
                    Elated with their spccess, the Mexicans offered battle in the plain of Otumba.
                    This was what Cortes desired, and it proved their destruction. Cortes gave the
                    signal for battle, and, on the 7th of July 1520, gained a victory which decided
                    the fate of Mexico. Immediately afterwards, he proceeded to Tlascala, assembled
                    an auxiliary army of natives, subjected the neighbouring provinces, and then
                    marched a second time against Mexico, which, after a gallant defence of several
                    months, was retaken on the 13th of August 1521. These successes were entirely
                    owing to the genius, valour, and profound but unscrupulous policy of Cortes; and
                    the account of them, which he transmitted to Spain, excited the admiration of
                    his countrymen. The extent of his conquests, and the ability he had displayed,
                    effaced the censure which he had incurred by the irregularity of his operations;
                    and public opinion having declared in his favour, Charles V., disregarding the
                    pretensions of Velasquez, appointed him governor and captain-general of Mexico,
                    at the same time conferring on him the valley of Guaxaca, which was erected into
                    a marquisats, with a considerable revenue. But although his power was
                    thusçonfirméd by royal authority, and although he exerted himself to consolidate
                    Spanish domination throughout all Mexico, the means he employed were such that
                    the natives, reduced to despair, took arms against the Spaniards. This revolt,
                    however, was speedily subdued, and the Mexicans were everywhere forced to yield
                    to the ascendency of European discipline and valour. Guatimozin, who had been
                    recognised as emperor, and a great number of caciques, accused <hi rend="italic"
                        >of</hi> having conspired against the conquerors, were publicly' executed,
                    with circumstances of great cruelty, by order <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Cortes.
                    Meanwhile the court of Madrid, dreading the ambition and popularity' of the
                    victorious chief, sent commissioners to watch his conduct and thwart his
                    proceedings; and whilst he was completing the conquest of New Spain, his goods
                    were seized by the fiscal of the Council of the Indies, and his retainers
                    imprisoned and put into irons. Indignant at the ingratitude of his sovereign,
                    Cortes returned in person to Spain, to appeal to the justice of the emperor, and
                    appeared there with great splendour. The emperor received him with every mark of
                    distinction, and decorated him with the order of St Iago. Cortes returned to
                    Mexico with new titles but diminished authority, a viceroy having been intrusted
                    with the administration of civil affairs, whilst the military department, with
                    permission to push his conquests, was all that remained to Cortes. This division
                    of powers became a source <hi rend="italic">of</hi> continual dissension, and
                    caused the failure of the last enterprises in which he engaged. Nevertheless, in
                    1536, he discovered the peninsula of California, and surveyed a part of the gulf
                    which separates it from Mexico. At length, tired <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    struggling with adversaries unworthy of him, whom the court took care to
                    multiply, he returned to Europe, hoping to confound his enemies. But Charles V.
                    received him coldly'. Cortes dissembled, redoubled the assiduity of his
                    attendance on the emperor; accompanied him in the disastrous expedition to
                    Algiers in 1541, served as a volunteer, and had a horse killed under him. This
                    was his last appearance in the field, and if his advice had been followed, the
                    Spanish arms would have been saved from disgrace, and Europe delivered nearly
                    three centuries earlier from the scourge of organised piracy. Soon afterwards he
                    fell into neglect, and could scarcely obtain an audience. One day, however,
                    having forced his way through the crowd which surrounded the emperor’s carriage,
                    and mounted on the door-step, Charles, astonished at an act of such audacity,
                    demanded to know who he was. “I am a man,” replied the conqueror of Mexico,
                    proudly, “who has given you more provinces than your ancestors left you cities.”
                    This haughty declaration of important services ili-requited could scarcely fail
                    to offend a monarch on whom fortune had lavished her choicest favours; and
                    Cortes, overwhelmed with disgust, withdrew' from court, passed the remainder of
                    his days in solitude, and died, near Seville, on the 2d of December 1554, being
                    then in the sixty-third year of his age. The only writings <hi rend="italic"
                        >of</hi> Cortes are four letters, on the subject of his conquests, which he
                    addressed to Charles V., and which have fortunately been given to the world. The
