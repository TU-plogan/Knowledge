PENNAR, a river of Hindustan, which has its source not far from Nundydroog. It flows at first in a northerly direction until it approaches Gooty, and then takes a southeast course by Gandicotta and Cuddapah; after which it reaches the sea at Gungapatnam by an easterly course, after passing the fortress of Nelloor.
