PHYSHARMONICA, a musical instrument, in which the immediate sonorous bodies are springs of steel or of brass, thrown into vibration by a current of air impelled against them. It was invented by Hackel, at Vienna, and is an instrument of the same kind as the aeolodicon, or aeo-line, which was previously invented by Eschenbach, a Bavarian. The same sort of instrument was reproduced in England a few years ago. On the Continent it has been introduced into organs as a very efficient stop. See the article Music for some notices of similar instruments.
