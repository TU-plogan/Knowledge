PELOPONNESUS, a large peninsula to the south of the continent of Greece. It was called the island of Pelops, though properly not an island, but a peninsula, ending in a point like the leaf of the plane-tree. Anciently called Apia and Pelasgia, this peninsula was second to no other country for nobleness, being situated between the Aegean and Ionian Seas, and resembling a plane-leaf, on account of its angular recesses or bays. It is now called the Morea.
