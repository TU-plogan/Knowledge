PENRITH, a market-town and parish in the ward of Leath, in the county of Cumberland, 284 miles from London, and seventeen from Carlisle. It is an ancient town, which in the wars between England and Scotland frequently changed masters; and near to the town, on the bank of the river Emont, are now shown two curious caverns, said to have been occupied by the peaceable inhabitants during the frontier excursions of the two nations. The parish church is a handsome structure, of old date, but modernized. There are markets, which are held on Tuesday and Saturday; and there are some manufactories for woollen and cotton goods. The population amounted in 1801 to 3801, in 1811 to 4328, in 1821 to 5385, and in 1831 to 6059; but in it is included that of the whole parish, comprehending the townships of Burrogate, Dockray, Middlegate, Sandgate, Carelton, Nether-end-bridge, and Plymton.
