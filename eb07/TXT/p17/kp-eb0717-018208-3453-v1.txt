PELUSIUM, in Ancient Geography, was a strong city of Egypt, without the Delta, distant twenty stadia from the sea, and situated amidst marshes, from which circumstance it derived its name. It was called the key or inlet oj Egypt, because, if taken, the rest of Egypt lay quite open and exposed to an enemy.
