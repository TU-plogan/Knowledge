PILOT, an officer who superintends the navigation of a ship, squadron, or fleet, either upon the sea-coast or upon the main ocean. It is, however, more particularly applied by our mariners to the person charged with the direction of a shipâ€™s course on or near the sea-coast, and into the roads, bays, rivers, havens, and creeks, within his respective district.
