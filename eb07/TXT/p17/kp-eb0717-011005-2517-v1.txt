PASSAGES, a seaport town of the province of Guipuscoa, in Spain. It stands on both banks of the river Oyarzun, near to the place where it falls into the Bay of Biscay, and having its entrance defended by the castle of St Isabel. The harbour was formerly adapted to admit the largest ships, but it is now so injured by the sand accumulated at its mouth, as to be accessible only to vessels'of light draught of water. It still has a naval arsenal and hospital, and capacious storehouses, though but little use is made of them. It has two churches, a chapel, and an hospital, with 520 houses, and 2400 inhabitants, many of whom find employment in the fisheries. Long. 2. 0. 5. W. Lat. 43. 20. 30. N.
