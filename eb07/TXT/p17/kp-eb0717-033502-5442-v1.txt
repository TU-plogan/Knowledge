PETWORTH, a market-town of the county of Sussex, in the rape of Arundel, and hundred of Rotherbridge. It is situated on the river Arun, fifty miles from London, and has a market which is held on Saturday. The streets are irregular, but the whole appearance is clean. The church is a fine object, and has a very lofty spire. The chief object of attraction is the magnificent mansion and park of the Earl of Egremont, the descendant of the celebrated Sir William Wyndham, to whom it, with other large estates, descended from the Percys, Earls of Northumberland, by a female branch. The population in 1801 amounted to 2264, in 1811 to 2459, in 1821 to 2781, and in 1831 to 3114.
