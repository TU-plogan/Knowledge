PENARANDA, a town of Spain, in the province of Avela, and partida of St Jago. It is the capital of a small district called the Sermo de St Vincente. It was once fortified, but its walls are now in a dilapidated state. It has a fortress, three churches, two monasteries, nine hundred and fifty houses, and about 3500 inhabitants, depending for a scanty subsistence chiefly on the cultivation of the soil.
