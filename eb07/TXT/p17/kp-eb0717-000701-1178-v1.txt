PAP Castle, in England, in Bridekirk parish, Cumberland, originally stood two miles from Cockermonth, on the other side of the Derwent. Its antiquity is proved by se veral monuments; and a large green stone vessel found here, with little images upon it, is supposed to have been formerly a Danish font. Pap Castle, which seems to have been so called from Pipard, its owner, is said to have been demolished, and the materials employed in building Cockermouth Castle.
