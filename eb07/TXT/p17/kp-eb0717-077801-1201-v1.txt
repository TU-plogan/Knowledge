PLAIN, or Plane, in general, an appellation given to whatever is smooth and even, or simple, obvious, and easy to be understood; and, consequently, stands opposed to rough, enriched, or laboured.

A plain figure, in Geometry, is an uniform surface, from every point of the perimeter of which right lines may be drawn to every other point in the same. A plain angle is one contained under two lines or surfaces, in contradistinction to a solid angle. See Angle and Geometry. The doctrine of plain triangles, as those included under three right? lines, is termed plain trigonometry. See the article Trigonometry.
