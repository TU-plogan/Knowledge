PATIGUMO, a corruption of the words pate de guimauve, is the name of a sort of paste or cake much used on the Continent as an agreeable and useful remedy for catarrhal defluxions, and supposed by Dr Percival to consist of gum-arabic combined with sugar and the albumen of eggs. It has been said, however, that the powdered substance of the marshmallow is the chief ingredient of the composition.
