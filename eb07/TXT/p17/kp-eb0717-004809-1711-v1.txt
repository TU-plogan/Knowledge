PAPPUS, an eminent philosopher of Alexandria, said by Suidas to have flourished under the Emperor Theodosius the Great, who reigned from 379 to 395. His writings prove him to have been a consummate mathematician. Many of them, however, are lost; and those which remain continued long in manuscript, detached parts only having been occasionally published, until Carolus Manolessius published his remains entire at Bologna in 1660, folio.
