Instead of giving a literal and bald translation of this advertisement, which runs exactly in the style of other quack bills, it may be sufficient to observe, that the medicine recommended is said, when taken inwardly, to raise the spirits, remove costiveness and inveterate coughs; to cure pains of the breast and stomach-aches; to assist respiration, and remove certain female obstructions. When applied externally, it cures wounds and sores, whether old or fresh, removes ringing of the ears, fastens the teeth when loose, and strengthens the gums. All this, and much more, it is said to do in a wonderful manner; and is declared to be the true royal balsam of Jerusalem, and an universal specific.

It is indeed next to a miracle that so many monuments of Grecian literature are still to be found amongst men. Notwithstanding the burning of the famous library of Alexandria, and the almost numberless wars, massacres, and devastations, which have from time to time in a manner desolated those countries where the Greek once flourished; we are told that there still remain about three thousand books written in that language.

We shall now conclude this section with a brief detail of the most distinguished stages and variations through which this noble tongue passed from the age of Homer till the taking of Constantinople, in the year 1453, a period of more than two thousand years.

Homer gave the Greek poetry its colour and consistency, and enriched, as well as harmonized, the language. From the coincidence of epithets and cadence in Homer and Hesiod, it appears that the Greek heroic verse was formed spon - taneously, by the old Aotδoι, a sort of improvisatori ; and that Homer and his early followers adopted their versification. The Iliad and Odyssey have much of the air of extempore compositions; an epithet is never wanting to fill up a verse; and a set of expressions are mechanically annexed to such ideas as were of frequent recurrence. Hence that copiousness and profusion of words in the old Greek bard, which forms such a contrast to the condensed and laboured composition of Virgil.

The Greek prose was of a more difficult structure; and it may be distributed into different styles or degrees of purity. Of the prose authors now extant, the first and best style is that of Herodotus in the natural, and of Plato in the florid or mixed kind, of Xenophon in the pure and simple, of Thucydides and Demosthenes in the austere style. Nothing, perhaps, is so conducive to form a good taste in composition as the study of these writers.

The style of Polybius forms a new epoch in the history of the Greek language. It was the idiotic or popular manner of expression, especially amongst military men, in his time, that is, about the 150th Olympiad. It became the model of succeeding writers, by introducing a simple unstudied expression, and by emancipating them from the anxious labour of the old Greeks respecting the cadence and choice of words. The style of the New Testament, being plain and popular, frequently resembles that of Polybius, as has been fully shown by Raphelius, and by Kirchmaier.^[1. De Parallclismo Novi Testamenti et Polybii, 1725. ]
[7:17:408]

Before this historian, the Alexandrian Jews had formed a new or Hellenistic style, resulting from the expression of oriental ideas and idioms in Greek words, after that language had lost of its purity, in proportion as it gained in general use, by the conquests of Alexander. The Hellenistic is the language of the Septuagint, the Apocrypha, the New Testament, and partly of Philo and Josephus. This mixture in the style of the evangelists and apostles, is one credential of the authenticity of the best of all books, a book which could not have been written except by Jewish authors in the first century.^[2. See the fine remarks of Bishop Warburton, Doctrine of Grace, book i. ch. 8—10. ] Critics lose their labour in attempting to adjust the Scripture-Greek to the standard of Atticism.

The diction of the Greek historians, and geographers of the Augustan age, is formed on that of Polybius, but improved and modernized, like the English of the present age, as compared with that of Clarendon or Bacon. More perspicuous than refined, it was well suited to such compilations as were then written by men of letters, such as Dionysius, Diodorus, and Strabo, without much experience or any eminent rank in public life.

The ecclesiastical style was cultivated in the Christian schools of Alexandria, Antioch, and Constantinople; it was rank and luxuriant, full of oriental idioms, and formed in a great measure on the Septuagint version. Such for instance, is the style of Eusebius. After him, the best Christian writers polished their compositions in the schools of rhetoric under the later sophists. Hence the popular and flowing purity of St. Chrysostom, who has more good sense than Plato, and perhaps as many good words.

On the Greek of the Byzantine empire, there is an excellent dissertation by Ducange, de Causis corruptae Graecitatis, prefixed to his glossary, together with Portius’s Grammar of the modern Greek. This last stage of the Greek language presents a miserable picture of Turkish barbarism; and, what is most surprising, there is no city of Greece where the language is more different from the ancient than at Athens; the reason of which seems to be, that that city has long been inhabited by a mixed multitude of different nations.

In a word, the Greeks have left the most durable monuments of human wisdom, fortitude, magnificence, and ingenuity, in their improvement of every art and science, and in the finest writings upon every subject necessary, profitable, elegant, or entertaining. They have furnished the brightest examples of every virtue and accomplishment, natural or acquired, political, moral, or military. They excelled in mathematics and philosophy; in all the forms of government, in architecture, navigation, commerce, war; as orators, poets, and historians, they stand yet unrivalled, and are likely to remain so for ever; nor are they less to be admired for the exercises and amusements they invented, and brought to perfection, in the institution of their public games, their theatres, and sports.

Let us further observe, that in vain will our readers look for these admired excellencies in any of the best translations from the Greek; they may indeed communicate some knowledge of what the originals contain; they may present the reader with propositions, characters, and events; but allowing them to be more faithful and more accurate than they really are, or can well be, still they are no better than copies, in which the spirit and lustre of the originals are almost totally lost. The mind may be instructed, but will not be enchanted; the picture may bear some faint resemblance, and if painted by a masterly hand may give pleasure; but who would be satisfied with the canvass, when he may possess the real object ? who would prefer a piece of coloured glass to a diamond ? It is not possible to preserve the beauties of the original in a translation. The powers of the Greek vastly exceed those of any other tongue. Whatever the Greeks describe is always felt, and almost seen; motion and music are in every tone, enthusiasm and enchantment possess the mind.

Graiis ingenium, Graiis dedit ore rotundo, Musa loqui.

sect. VIII. OF THE LATIN LANGUAGE.

This language, like every other spoken by barbarians, was in its beginning rough and uncultivated. What people the Romans were, is a point as to which antiquarians are not yet agreed. In their own opinion they were sprung from the Trojans ;^[3. Titus Livius, lib. i. cap. 1, &c. ] Dionysius of Halicarnassus derives them from the Greeks ;^[4. Antiq. Rom. lib. i. ] and Plutarch informs us^[5. Vita Romul. ] that some people imagined they were sprung from the Pelasgians. The fact is, they were a mixture of people collected out of Latium and the adjacent parts, whom a variety of accidents had induced or compelled to establish themselves in that mountainous region, in order to secure their own property, and plunder that of their neighbours. They were in all probability composed of Arcadians, Sabines, Latins, Hetruscans, Umbrians, Oscans, Pelasgians, and others; and if so, their language must have been a mixture of the different dialects peculiar to all these discordant tribes.

The Latin language ought then to be a commingled mass of the Arcadian, that is, the Aeolian Greek,^[6. Strabo, lib. v. Dionysius Halicarnasseus, Antiq. lib. i. ] the Pelasgic, Hetruscan, and Celtic dialects. But these jarring elements, like the people to whom they respectively belonged, gradually incorporated, and produced what was afterwards called the Latin tongue.

The Arcadians were a Pelasgian tribe,^[7. Strabo et Herodotus. ] and consequently spoke a dialect of that ancient Greek produced by the coalition of this tribe with the savage aborigines of Greece. This dialect was the ground-work of the Latin. Every scholar allows, that the Aeolian Greek, which was strongly tinctured with the Pelasgic, constituted the model upon which the Latin language was formed. From this deduction it appears, that the Latin tongue is much more ancient than the modern Greek; and of course we may add, that the Greek, as it stood before it was thoroughly polished, bore a very near resemblance to that language. Hence it may be concluded, that the knowledge of the Latin language is necessary in order to understand the Greek. Let us not then expect to find the real ingredients of the Greek tongue in the academic groves of Athens, or in Smyrna, or in Rhodope, or in Haemus; but let us seek for them on the banks of the Tiber, and on the fields of Laurentum.

A very considerable part of the Latin tongue was derived from the Hetruscan. That people were the masters of the Romans in every thing sacred. From them they learned the ceremonies of religion, the method of arranging games and public festivals, the art of divination, the interpretation of omens, the method of lustrations, expiations, &c. It would, we believe, be easy to prove, that the Pelasgians^[8. Thucydides, lib. vi. ] andHetruscans^[9. The Hetrusci were variously denominated by the Greeks and Romans. The former called them Tυζ rnνo , which was their true name, for they actually emigrated from Tarshish, or the western coast of Asia Minor, and consequently Herodotus everywhere calls them r Γυξ-σ> t v0 . The Aeolians changed a into u ; hence in that dialect they were called Tvρr∏νβι, from Tarsus. The Romans styled them Tusci, probably from the Greek verb 3υω, sacrifico, alluding to the skill which that people professed in the ceremonies of religion. They called their country Hetruria, we think from the Chaldaic word heretum, a magician or sorcerer; a name deduced from their skill in divination, ι ] were the same race of people; and if this was the case, their languages must have differed in dialect only.

The Umbrian or the Celtic enters deeply into the composition of the Latin tongue. In proof of this, we need only [7:17:409] refer to Pelloutier, Bullet’s Mémoires de la Langue Celtic partie premiere, Abbé Pezron’s Origin of Ancient Nations, and other works of a similar kind. Whether the old Celtic differed essentially from the Pelasgic and Hetruscan, would be a matter of curious investigation, were this a proper subject for the present article.

The Latin abounds with oriental words, especially Hebrew, Chaldaic, and Persian. These are certainly remains of the Pelasgian and Hetruscan tongues, spoken originally by people who emigrated from regions where such words formed parts of the vernacular language. The Greeks, in polishing tlιeir language, gradually distorted and disfigured vast numbers of the rough eastern terms, which formed a very great part of it, as we have already shown in tire preceding section.

The Romans, of less delicate organs, left them in their natural state, and their natural air readily betrays their original. We had collected a large list of Latin words still current in the East; but we find that Thomassin^[10. Glossary. ] and Oge-rius,^[11. Gτoeeα et Latina lingua Hebτaizantes, Venice 1763. If these books are not at hand, Dr. Littleton’s Dictionary will, in a great mea-βure, supply their place. ] and especially Μ. Gebelin, in his excellent Latin Dictionary, have rendered that labour superfluous.

In this language, too, there are not a few Gothic terms. How these found their way into the Latin, it is not easy to discover, unless, as Pelloutier supposes, the Celtic and Gothic languages were originally the same; or perhaps it may be conjectured, that such words formed part of a primitive language, which was at one time universal.

There are, besides, in the Latin a great number of obsolete Greek words, which were in process of time obliterated, and others substituted in their stead; so that, upon the whole, we are persuaded, that the most effectual method for distinguishing the difference between the early and modern Greek, would be to compare the ancient Latin with the more recent, especially as there existed very little difference between the ancient Greek and Latin in the earliest periods. But however this may be, it is certain that the Roman letters were the same with the ancient Greek. Forrnae literis Latinis quae veterrimis Graecorurn, says Tacitus,^[12. Tacitus, Anal. lib. i. ] whilst Pliny^[13. Nat. Hist. lib. vii. cap. 58. ] states the same thing, and for the truth of his assertion appeals to a monument extant in his own time. These old Greek letters were no other than the Pelasgian, which we have shown from Diodorus Siculus to have been prior to the Cadmean.^[14. For the figure of these letters, see Astle, Postellus, Montfaucon, (Paloegraphia Gτceca,J Μ. Gebelin, and others. ]

That the Latins borrowed the scheme of their declensions from the Greeks, is evident from the exact resemblance of the terminations of the cases throughout the three similar declensions. In nouns of the first declension, the resemblance is too palpable to stand in need of illustration. In the second, the Greek genitive is oι ; but in Latin the o is thrown out, and the termination becomes i. In the section on the Greek language, we have observed, that the sounds of i and V differed very little; therefore the Latins used t instead of V. The Latin dative ends in o, which is the Greek dative, throwing away t subscriptum, which was but faintly sounded in that language. No genuine Greek word ended in μ or m. The Hellenes seem to have abhorred that bellowing liquid ;' it is certain, however, that they imported it from the East, as well as the other letters, and that they employed it in every other capacity, except in that of closing words. In the termination of flexions, they changed into ν.

The Latins retained m, which had been imported to them as a terminating letter at an era before the Greek language had undergone its last refinement. Hence the Latin accusative in um, instead of the Greek in ov. The vocative case, we imagine, was in this declension originally like the nominative. The Latins have no dual number, because, in our opinion, the Aeolic dialect, from which they copied, had none. It would no doubt, be a violent stretch of etymological exertion, to derive either the Latin genitive plural of the second declension from the same case of the Greek, or that of the latter from the former; we therefore leave this anomaly, without pretending to account for its original formation. The third declensions in both languages are so exactly parallel, that it would be superfluous to compare them. But even here the dative plural is another anomaly, and we think a very disagreeable one, which we leave to the conjectures of more profound etymologists. For the other peculiarities of Latin nouns, as they are nearly similar to those of the Greek, we must beg leave to refer our readers to that section.

The Latins have no articles, which is certainly a defect in their language. The Pelasgic, from which they copied, had not adopted that word in the demonstrative sense. Homer indeed seldom uses it; and the probability is, that the more early Greeks used it less frequently, at least in the sense above mentioned. Thus in Latin, when I say, video hominem, it is impossible to find out by the bare words whether the word hominem intimates a man, or the man, whereas in Greek it would be βλeπω άνθρωπον, I see a man, βλeπω τον άνθρωπον, I see the man. Hence the first expression is indefinite, and the second definite.

The substantive verb sum in Latin seems to be formed partly from the Greek and partly not. Some of the persons of the present tense have a near resemblance to the Greek verb εω or èiµi, whilst others vary widely from that archetype. The imperfect praeterite and praeterperfect have nothing in common with the Greek verb, and cannot, we think, be forced into an alliance with it. The future ero, was of old eso, and is indeed genuine Greek. Upon the whole, in our apprehension, the Latin substantive verb more nearly resembles the Persian verb hesten than that of any other language with which we are acquainted.

» From what exemplar the Latin verbs were derived, it is by no means easy to ascertain. We know that attempts have been made to deduce them all from the Aeolic Greek, and that the Romans themselves were extremely fond of this chimera; but the almost numberless irregularities, both in the formation and conjugation of their verbs, induce us to believe that only a part of them were formed upon that model. We are inclined to think that the terminations in bam, bas, bat, bamus, &c. were produced by their union with a fragment of some obsolete verb, which is now wholly lost. In the verb amo, for instance we are sure that the radix am is the Hebrew word mother ; but how am-abam, am~abo, amarem were fabricated, and connected with the radical am, is not so easily determined. That Latin verbs, as well as the Greek, are composed of an inflexible radix and another flexible verb, cannot be doubted; but what this flexible auxiliary was, cannot now be clearly ascertained. It is not altogether improbable that such parts of the verbs as deviate from the Greek archetype were supplied by fragments of the verb ha, which pervades all the branches of the Gothic language, and has, we conceive produced the Latin verb habeo. When the Greeks began to etymologise, they seldom overpassed the verge of their own language; and the Latins pursued nearly the same course. If their own language presented a plausible etymology, they embraced it; if not, they immediately had recourse to the Greek; and this was the ne plus ultra, of their etymological researches. Cicero, tìuintillian, Festus, and even Varro, the most learned of all the Romans, stop here; all beyond is either doubt or impenetrable darkness. Their opinion above mentioned[7:17:410] we offer only as a conjecture; as to the decision we leave it to more able critics.

The want of aorists or indefinite tenses seems to us to be a palpable defect in the Latin language. The use of these amongst the Greeks entitled the writer to express the specific variations of time with more accuracy and precision than the Latins, who never attempted to specify them by any other tenses but the imperfect and pluperfect. Indeed we should imagine, that both the Greeks and Latins were much inferior to the English in this respect. The Latin word lego, for example, may be translated into English three different ways; as, 1 read, I do read, and I am reading.

The Latins, in reducing their verbs to four conjugations, formed their inflexions in a very irregular manner. Numbers of the first class inflect their praeterite and supine like those of the second; thus, domο, instead of giving avi and atum, has ui and itum, like monui and monitum. Again, not a few verbs of the third conjugation have ivi and itum, as if they belonged to the fourth; e. g. peto, petivi, petitum. Then, some verbs have io in the present, ivi in the praeterite, and itum in the supine, whilst, contrary to the rules of analogy, they in reality belong to the third; such are cupio, cupivi, cupitum, cupere, and others. Some verbs of the second conjugation have their praeterite and supine as if they belonged to the third; thus, juδco, jussi, jussum,jubere, and augeo, auxi, auctum, augere. Some verbs, which are actually of the fourth conjugation, have their praeterite and supine as if they were of the third; thus, sentio, sensi, sensum, sentire, and haurio, hausi, haustum, haurire. If these are not manifest irregularities, we cannot say what deserves the name. The fact seems to stand thus. The Romans were originally a banditti of robbers, bankrupts, runaway slaves, shepherds, husbandmen, and peasants of the most unpolished character. They were engaged in perpetual broils and quarrels at home, and seldom enjoyed repose abroad. Their profession was robbery and plunder. Like old Ishmael, their hands were against every man, and every man’s hand was against them. In such a state of society no time was left for cultivating the sciences. Accordingly, the arts of war and government were their sole profession. This is so true, that their own poet has characterized them in the following manner :—

Excudent alii spirantia mollius aera, Credo equidem: vivos ducent de marmore vultus; Orabunt causas melius; coelique meatus Describent radio, et surgentia sidera dicent s Tu regere imperio populo», Romane, memento: Hae tibi erunt artes: pacisque imponere morem, Parcere subjectis, et debellare superbos.

Another blemish in the Latin language is occasioned by its wanting a participle of the praeterite sense in the active voice. This defect is perpetually felt, and is the cause of an awkward circumlocution wherever it happens to present itself. Thus, Imperator, cum transiiset flumen, aciem instruxit ; the general having crossed the river drew up his army. Here cum transiiset flumen is a manifest circumlocution, which is at once avoided in the Greek ó hγeμων πepασας τοv ποτaμοv, κ. τ. λ. This must always prove an incumbrance in the case of active intransitive verbs. But when active deponent verbs occur, it is easily avoided. Thus, Caesar cohortatus milites, praelii committendi signum dedit ; Caesar having encouraged the soldiers, gave the signal for joining battle. Another palpable defect in this language arises from the want of a participle of the present passive. This again must be productive of inconvenience upon many occasions, as will be obvious to every Latin student.

The two supines are universally allowed to be substantive nouns of the fourth declension. How these assumed the nature of verbs it is not easy to determine. When they are placed after verbs or nouns, the matter is attended with no difficulty; but how they should acquire an active signification, and take the case of the verb with which they are connected, is not so easily accounted for, and certainly implies a stretch of prerogative. The Latin gerunds form another unnatural anomaly. Every scholar knows that these words are nothing but the neuters of the participles in dus of the future passive. The fabricators of the Latin language, however, elevated them from their primary condition, giving them upon many occasions an active signification. In this case we must have recourse to the

Si volet usus, Quem penes arbitrium est, et jus et norma loquendi.

Another inconvenience, which is perhaps more severelyfelt than any of the preceding, arises from the want ofthc use of the present participle of the verb sum. Every body knows what a convenience is derived from the frequent use of the participle ωv in Greek; and indeed it appears to us somewhat surprising that the Latins neglected to introduce the participle ens into their language. In this we believe they were singular. Here again a circumlocution becomes necessary. In such a case as the following, “The senate being at Rome, passed a decree,” instead of saying senatus ens Romae, legem tulit, we arc obliged to say cum senatus Romae esset, legem tulit. If the words ens or existens had been adopted, as in the Greek, this odious circumlocution would have been avoided. Many other defects of a similar kind will occur to every person who shall choose to search for them, and these, too, in the most approved classical authors.

If anyone will take the trouble to compare the structure of the Greek and the Latin languages, he may very soon be convinced that their characteristic features are extremely different. The genius of the former appears easy and natura!; whereas that of the latter, notwithstanding the united efforts of the poets, orators, and philosophers, who wrote in it, still bears the marks of violence and restraint. Hence it appears that the Latin language was pressed into the service, and compelled almost against its peculiar genius to bend to the laws of the Grecian model. Take a sentence of Hebrew, Chaldaic, Arabian, or Persian, and try to translate it into Greek withoutregarding the arrangement of thewords, and you will find it no difficult task; but make the same trial with respect to the Latin, and you will probably discover that the attempt is attended with considerable difficulty. To translate Greek into English is not a laborious task; the texture of the two languages is so congenial, that the words and phrases, and even the idiomatic expressions, naturally slide into each other. But with the Latin the case is quite otherwise; and before elegant English can be produced, one must deviate considerably from the original. Should we attempt to translate a piece of English into Greek, and at the same time into Latin, the translation of the former would be attended with much less difficulty than that of the latter, supposing the translator to be equally skilled in both languages.

This incongruity seems to spring fromthe following cause. Before any man of considerable abilities, either in the capacity of a poet, grammarian, or rhetorician, appeared at Rome, the language had acquired a strong and inflexible tone, too stubborn to be exactly moulded according to the Grecian standard. After a language has continued several centuries without receiving a new polish, it becomes like a fidl grown tree, incapable of being bent to the purposes of the mechanic. For this reason, it is highly probable, tlιat the language in question could not be forced into a complete assimilation with the Greek. But notwithstanding all these obstructions, in process of time it arrived at such an exalted pitch of perfection, as to rival, perhaps to excel, all the other European languages, Greek only excepted. Had men possessingthe taste,judgment, and industry of Ennius, Plautus, Terence, Cicero, and the worthies of the Augustan age, appeared in the early stages of the Roman commonwealth, their language would have been thoroughly reduced to the [7:17:411] Grecian archetype, and thetwo dialects might have improved each other by a rivalship between the nations who employed them.

Without pretending to encumber our readers with a pompous and elaborate account of the beauties of that imperial language, which have been detailed by writers almost without number, we shall endeavour to lay before them as briefly as possible its pristine character, the steps by which it gradually rose to perfection, the period when it arrived at the summit of its excellence, and the means by which it rapidly degenerated until it was finally lost amongst the very people to whom it bad owed its birth.

We have observed already, that the Latin was originally a colluvies of all the languages spoken by the vagrant people who composed the first elements of that republic. The prevailing dialects were the Pelasgian or Etruscan, which we conceive to have been the same; and the Celtic, which was undoubtedly the aboriginal idiom of Italy. Hencethe primarydialect of the Romans was composed of discordant materials, which in our opinion never acquired a natural and congenial union. The Pelasgian or Etruscan part of it retained a strong tincture of the oriental style. But the Celtic portion appears to have been the prevalent one, since we find that most of the names of places, especially in the middle and northern parts of Italy, are actually of Celtic origin.^[15. For proof of this our readers may consult Abbé Pezron, Pelloutier, Bullet’s Mémoires, Gebelin, Proef. Diet. Lαt. and many others. ] It is clear therefore that the dialect of the first Romans was composed of the languages above mentioned. Who those first Romans were, it is impossible to determine with any degree of certainty; indeed the Roman historians afford us as little information upon the subject, as their etymologists do respecting the origin of their language. Their most celebrated writers upon this point were Aelius Gallus, Quintus Cornificius, Nonius Marcellus, Festus, and some others of less note. At the head of these we ought to place Terentius Varro, whom Cicero styles the most learned of all the Romans. But from such writers we need expect no light. Their etymologies are generally childish and futile. Of the language of the most ancient Romans we can only reason by analogy; and by that rule we can discover nothing more than what has already been advanced.

We may rest assured that the dual number, the articles, the participle above mentioned, the aorists, and the whole middle voice, never appeared in the Latin language; and for this reason that they were not current in those languages from which it was derived, at least at the time when it was first fabricated. Besides all this, many circumstances concur to make it highly probable that, in the earliest period of the language, very few inflexions were introduced. First, when the Pelasgians left Greece, the Greek language itself was not fully polished. Secondly, the Arcadians were never thoroughly civilized. They were a rustic pastoral people, and minded little the refinements of a civilized state; consequently the language which they brought into Italy at that era must have been of a coarse and irregular contexture. Thirdly, when the Thessalian Pelasgians arrived inItalyabout the time of Deucalion, the Greek language itself was rude and barbarous;^[16. Dionysius Halicarnasseus, lib· i∙ ] and, whichisof Stillmore consequence, if we may credit Herodotus quoted in the former section, the Greek people had never adopted the Hellenic tongue. Hence it appears, that the part of the Latin language derived from the Pelasgian or Etruscan must have taken a deep tincture from the oriental tongue. If we may judge of the Celtic of that age by the Celtic of the present, the same character must likewise have distinguished its structure.

From these circumstances, we think it appears that the earliest language of the Romans was but very little diversified by means of inflections. It nearly resembled the oriental exemplar, and consequently differed widely from the modern Latin. The effect of this was, that the modern Romans could not understand the language of their early progenitors. Polybius,^[17. See his History, lib. iii. sub initio. ] speaking of the earliest treaty between the Romans and Carthaginians, makes the following observation: “Believe me,” says he, “the Roman language has undergone so many changes since that time to the present, that even those who are most deeply skilled in the science of antiquities cannot understand the words of that treaty except with the greatest difficulty.”^[18. This treaty, according to the same historian, was concluded in the consulship of Lucius Junius Brutus and Marcus Valerius, twentyeight years before Xerxes made his descent upon Greece. ] From this source, then, has flowed that great number of oriental words with which the Latin language is impregnated. Being originally inflexible, they were not disguised as they now are with prefixes, affixes, metatheses, syncopes, antitheses, and the like, but plain and unadorned in their natural dress.

After the Romans had become acquainted with the Aeolian Greeks, who gradually seized upon both coasts of Italy towards the south, which they called Magna Graecia, they began to affect a Grecian air, and to torture their language into a foreign contexture. It appears, however, that at first the Grecian attire had rather an awkward appearance, and that several marks of violence were easily discerned. The most ancient specimen of this kind that we can recollect consists of the remains of the Twelve Tables. Here every thing is rude and of a clumsy cast; for although by this time considerable progress had been made in refinement, and the language of Rome had begun to appear in a Grecian uniform, still those changes were not altogether natural. Soon afterwards appeared Marcus Fabius Pictor and Sisenna, historians often quoted by Livy, but whose works have long since been irrecoverably lost. The Fasti Capitolini are frequently mentioned; but they too perished in the burning of the Capitol during the civil wars between Marius and Sylla. If those monuments had escaped the ravages of time, we should have been able to mark the progress of the Latin language from stage to stage, and to ascertain with the greatest accuracy its gradual configuration in the course of its progress towards the Grecian standard. We must therefore abandon the attempt to trace the Latin during those rude and barbarous periods, and descend to others which are better known and more characteristically marked. The latter, commenced when

Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit, et artes Intulit agresti Latio.

In this period flourished Ennius, who wrote in eighteen books, a Roman history in hexameter verse, which he called Annals, the greater part of which is now unhappily lost. He likewise translated Euhemerus de Origine Deorum, a work often mentioned by the Christian fathers in their disputes with the Pagans, and which is sometimes quoted by Cicero. Then followed Caius Lucilius the famous satirist, and a number of other writers, such as Accius, Valerius, Aedituus, Alpinus, whose fragments were published by the Stephens, at Paris, in 1564. All these imitated the writers of Greece or translated from them. By their perseverance and active exertions, the spirit of the Greek authors was transfused into the Latin language, and its structure accommodated to the Grecian standard.

Plautus and Terence, by translating into their own language, the comedies of Menander and Diphilus taught the Latin muses to breathe their inspirations in Attic Greek. To speak that language was then the fashion of the times, [7:17:412] as it is now with us to chatter French. Greek tutors were retained in every reputable family; and many Romans of the first rank were equally qualified to speak or write both in Greek and in Latin. The original jargon of Latium had now become obsolete and unintelligible; and even Cato the Ancient condescended to learn the Greek language at the age of eighty.

To pretend to enumerate the various, and we may add inimitable, examples of the Augustan or golden age of the Roman language, would be an insult to the understanding of our readers. We shall only take the liberty to translate a few lines from an able and excellent historian,^[19. Velleius Paterculus, lib. i cap. uU. ] who, had his honesty been equal to his judgment, might have rivalled the most celebrated writers of his country. Having observed that the Greek authors, who excelled in every province of literature, had all made their appearance nearly about the same time, and within a very short space of one another, hc adds: “Nor was this circumstance more conspicuous amongst the Greeks than amongst the Romans; for unless we go back to the rough and unpolished times, which deserve commendation only on account of their invention, the Roman tragedy is confined to Accius and the period when he flourished. The charming wit of Latin elegance was brought to light by Cecilius, Terentius, and Afranius, nearly in the same age. As for our historians if wc except Cato and some old obscure writers, they were all confined to a period of about eighty years; so neither has our stock of poets extended to a great space either backwards, or forwards. But the energy of the bar, and the finished beauty of prose eloquence, setting aside the same Cato (by the leave of Crassus, Scipio, Laelius, the Gracchi, Fannins, and Ser. Galba, be it spoken), broke out all at once under Tully the prince of his profession; so that one can now be delighted with none before him, and admire none except such as have either seen that orator or been seen by him.”

From this quotation it evidently appears, that the Romans themselves were convinced of the short duration of the golden age of their language. According to the most judicious critics, it commenced with the era of Cicero’s oratorical productions, and terminated with the reign of Tiberius, or rather, perhaps, it did not reach beyond the middle of that prince’s reign. It is generally believed that eloquence, and with it every thing liberal, elevated, and manly, was banished from Rome by the despotism of the Caesars. But we imagine that the transition was too instantaneous to have been entirely produced by that cause. Despotism was firmly established amongst the Romans about the middle of the reign of Augustus; and yet that period produced such a group of learned men as never perhaps adorned any other nation in so short a space of time. Despotism, we acknowledge, might have affected the eloquence of the bar, the noble and important objects which had animated the republican orators being now no more; but this circumstance could not affect poetry, history, philosophy, and jurisprudence. The style employed upon these subjects did not feel the fettersof despotism. The reign of Louis XIV. was the golden age of the French language; and we think that age produced a race of learned men, in every department superior in number and equal in genius to the literati who flourished under the noble and envied constitution of Britain during the same period, although the latter is likewise said to have been the golden age of this country. The British Islands, we conceive, still enjoy as much liberty as ever; yet we believe there are few persons who will affirm, that the writers of the present day are equal either in style or in genius to that noble group who flourished from the middle of the reign of Charles I. to the middle of the reign of George II.

In the East the same observation seems to hold true. The Persians have long groaned under the Mohammedan yoke; and yet every oriental scholar will allow, that in that country, and under the most galling tyranny, the most amazing productions of taste, genius, and industry, that ever dignified human nature, have been exhibited. Under the Arabian caliphs, the successors of Mohammed, appeared writers of a most sublime genius, although despotism was never more cruelly exercised than under those fanatics. The revival of letters in Italy during the fourteenth century, was chiefly promoted and cherished by the petty despots of that country. We cannot therefore be persuaded that the despotism of the Caesars banished eloquence and learning from Rome. Longinus indeed has attributed this misfortune to the cause lust stated, and tells us, that it is liberty which is formed to nurse the sentiments of great geniuses, to push forward the propensity of contest, to inspire them with the generous ambition of being the first in the first rank. But when Longinus wrote this, he did not reflect that he himself was a striking instance of the unsoundness of his own observation.

As to science, the fact is undoubtedly on the other side. That Seneca was superior to Cicero in philosophy, cannot be reasonably contradicted. The latter had read, and actually abridged, the whole mass of Grecian philosophy; but this displayed his reading rather than his learning. The former had addicted himself to the Stoic sect; and though he does not write with the same flow of eloquence as Tully, he thinks more deeply and reasons more closely. Pliny⅛ Natural History is indeed a wonderful collection, and contains more useful knowledge than all the writings of the Augustan age condensed into one mass. The historical annals of Tacitus, if inferior to Livy in elegance of style and majesty of diction, are much superior in arrangement and in vigour of composition. In short, we discover in these productions a deep insight into human nature, an extensive knowledge of the true science of government, a penetration which no dissimulation could escape, together with a sincere attachment to truth respecting both events and characters; nor is he inferior in the majesty, energy, and propriety of his harangues, wherever an equal opportunity presents itself. Quintilian, Pliny the younger, Suetonius, Petronius Arbiter, and Juvenal deserve high commendation, and are not inferior to their immediate predecessors. We think there is good reason to conclude, that the loss of liberty amongst the Romans did not produce the extinction of eloquence, science, elevation of sentiment, or refinement of taste. The circumstances which chiefly contributed to produce that revolution were of a different description.

Velleius Paterculus whom we have already quoted assigns some very plausible and judicious reasons for the catastrophe in question. “Emulation,” says he “is the nurse of genius; and one while envy, and another admiration fires imitation. According to the laws of nature, that which is pursued with the greatest ardour mounts to the top; but to be stationary in perfection is a difficult matter; and by the same analogy, that which cannot move forward must go backward. As at the outset we are animated to overtake those whom we deem before us, so when we despair of being able to overtake or to pass by them, our ardour languishes together with our hope; what it cannot overtake it ceases to pursue, and leaving the subject as already engrossed by another, it looks out for some new one upon which to exert itself. That by which we find that we are not able to acquire eminence we speedily relinquish, and try to discover some object elsewhere upon which to employ our intellectual powers. The consequence is, that frequent and variable transitions from subject to subject prove a great obstacle to the attainment of perfection in any profession.”

This was perhaps the case with the Romans. The he·
[7:17:413]

roes of the Augustan age had borne away the prize of eloquence, history, poetry, and elegant literature; and their successors despaired of being able to equal, much less to surpass them, in any of these pursuits. They were therefore placed under the necessity of striking out a new path by which they might hope to arrive at eminence. Consequently Seneca introduced the stile coupe, as the French call it; that is, a short, sparkling, figurative diction, abounding with antitheses, quaintnesses, witticisms, and embellished with meretricious ornaments r 3 ** r hereas the style of the Augustan age was natural, simple, solid, unaffected, and properly adapted to the nature of the subject as well as to the sentiments of the author.

The historian Sallust laid the foundation of the unnatural style here mentioned. Notwithstanding all the excellencies of that celebrated author, he everywhere exhibits an affectation of antiquity, an antithetical cast, an air of austerity, an accuracy, exactness, and regularity, the very opposite of that air dégage which nature displays in her most finished efforts. His words and his clauses seem to be adjusted exactly according to number, weight, and measure, without either excess or defect. Valleius Paterculus imitated this writer; and, as is generally the case with imitators, succeeded best in those points where his archetype had failed most egregiously. Tacitus, however excellent in other respects, deviated from the Augustan exemplars, and is thought to have imitated Sallust; but affecting brevity to excess, he often falls into obscurity. The other contemporary writers employ a cognate style; and because they have deviated from the Augustan standard, their works are held in less estimation, and are thought to beaι∙ about them marks of degeneracy. This degeneracy, however, did not spring from the despotic government under which these authors lived, but from the affectation of singularity into which they were betrayed by an eager though fruitless desire of signalizing themselves in the new mode, as their predecessors had done in the old.

But the mischiefs of this rage for innovation did not reach their sentiments, as it had done their style; for in that point we think they were so far from falling below the measure ofthe writers of the former age, that in many instances they appear to have surpassed them. With respect to sentiment and mental exertions, the authors in question preserved their vigour, till luxury and effeminacy, the consequence of power and opulence, enervated both the bodies and the minds of the Romans. The contagion soon became universal; and a listlessness, or intellectual torpor, the usual concomitant of luxury, spread an indolence over the mental faculties, which rendered them not only averse to, but even incapable of, industry and perseverance. This lethargic disposition of mind seems to have commenced towards the conclusion of the silver age; that is, about the end of the reign of Hadrian. It was then that the Roman eagle began to stoop, and that, in arts as well as in arms, the genius of Rome showed symptoms of decline.

As the Roman genius began, about this period, to decline, so the style of the silver age became gradually vitiated with barbarisms and exotic forms of speech. The multitudes of barbarians who flocked to Rome from all parts of the empire; the ambassadors offoreign princes,and often theprinces themselves, with their attendants; the prodigious numbers of slaves who were entertained in all the considerable families of the capital, and throughout Italy; the frequent commerce which the Roman armies upon the frontiers carried on with the barbarians; all concurred to vitiate the Latin language, and to interlard it with foreign words and idioms. In such circumstances, it was impossible for that or any other form of speech to continue pure and untainted. But this vitiated character both of style and of sentiment became more and more prevalent, in proportion as it descended from the reign of Hadrian towards the era of the removal of the seat of empire from Rome to Constantinople. Then succeeded the iron age, when the Roman language became absolutely rude and barbarous.

Towards the close of the silver, however, and during the whole course of what is called the brazen age, there appeared many λvriters of no contemptible talents. The most remarkable was Seneca the stoic, the master of Nero, whose character both as a man and a writer is discussed with great accuracy by the noble author of the Characteristics, a work to which our readers are referred. About the same time lived Persius the satirist, the friend and disciple of the stoic Cornutus, to whose precepts he did honour by his virtuous life; whilst by his works, though few, he showed an early proficiency in the science of morals.

Under the mild government of Hadrian and the Antonines lived Aulus Gellius, or, as some call him, Agellius; an entertaining writer in the miscellaneous way, and well skilled in criticism and antiquity. His works contain several valuable fragments of philosophy, which are indeed the most curious part of them. With Aulus Gellius we may rank Macrobius; not because he was a contemporary, for he is supposed to have lived under Honorius and Theodosius, but from his close resemblance in the character of writer. His works, like those of Gellius, are miscellaneous, being filled with mythology and ancient literature, intermixed with some philosophy. In the same age with Aulus Gellius flourished Apuleius of Madaura in Africa; a Platonic writer, whose matter in general far exceeds in merit his perplexed and affected style, which is but too conformable to the false rhetoric of the age in which he lived.

Boethius was descended from one of the noblest of the Roman families, and was consul in the beginning of the sixth century. He wrote many philosophical works; but his ethical work on the Consolation of Philosophy deserves great encomiums, both for the matter and the style, in which last respect, he approaches the purity of a far better age than his own. By command of Theodoric the king of the Goths this great and good man suffered death; and with him the Latin language, and the last remains of Roman dignity, may be said to have sunk in the western world. There were, besides, a goodly number both of poets and historians who flourished during this period, such as Silius Italicus, Claudian, Ausonius, and others, for a list of whom the reader may consult Fabricii Bibliotheca Latina. A number of ecclesiastical writers, some of whom deserve great commendation, also flourished about the same period. The chief of these is Lactantius, who has been deservedly dignified with the proud title of the Christian Cicero.

The Roman authors amount to a very small number in comparison of the Greek. At the same time, when we consider the extent and duration of the Roman empire, we are surprised to find so few writers of character and reputation in so vast a field, and think we have good reason to agree with the prince of Roman poets in the sentiment which has been already quoted.

Upon the whole, the Latin language deserves our attention beyond any other ancient tongue now extant. The grandeur of the people by whom it was spoken; the high genius of its writers; the empire which it still maintains amongst ourselves; the necessity we are under of learning it in order to obtain access to almost all the sciences, nay even to the knowledge of our own laws, judicial proceedings, and charters; all these circumstances, and many others too numerous to be detailed, render the acquisition of that imperial and universal language in a peculiar manner at once improving and interesting. Spoken by the conquerors of the ancient nations, it partakes of all their revolutions, and bears continually th eir impression. Strong and nervous whilst they were employed in nothing but battles and carnage, it thundered in the camps, and made the proudest people to tremble, and the most despotic monarchs to bend their stubborn [7:17:414] necks to the yoke. Copious and majestic, it became the learned language of Europe, when the Romans, weary of battles, inclined to vie with the Greeks in science and refinement; and by its lustre it caused to disappear the jargon of savages which disputed with it the possession of that quarter of the globe. After having controlled by its eloquence, and humanized byits laws, all those tribes, it became the language of religion; and it will continue to be studied and esteemed as long as good sense and classical taste remain in the world.

SECT. IX. CELTIC, GOTIÏIC, AND SCLAVONIAN LANGUAGES.

§ 1. Of th e Celtic Language. In treating of the origin of the Latin language, we observed that a great part of it had been derived from the Celtic. We shall now endeavour to give some account of the origin and extent of that ancient language, leaving the minutiae to grammars and dictionaries, as we have done with respect to the other dialects which have fallen under our consideration. The object of this treatise is to discuss questions in philology alone, not to enter into grammatical details, or lexicographical explanations.

The descendants of Japhet having peopled the western parts of Asia, at length entered Europe. Some broke into that quarter of the globe by the north, and others found means to cross the Danube near its mouth. Their posterity gradually ascended towards the source of that river; but afterwards they advanced to the banks of the Rhine, which they passed and thence spread themselves as far as the Alps and the Pyrenees.

These people, were, in all probability, composed of different families; allofthem,however,spoke the same language; their manners and customs bore a near resemblance; and there was no variety amongst them except that difference which climate always introduces. A ccordingly, they were all known, in the more early times, by the general name of Celto-scythae. In process of time, becoming exceedingly numerous, they were divided into several nations, which were distinguished by different names and territorial appellations. Those who inhabited that large country which is bounded by the ocean, the Mediterranean, the Rhine, the Alps, and the Pyrenees, were denominated Gauls or Celts. This people multiplied so prodigiously in the space of a few centuries, that the fertile regions which they then occupied could not afford them the means of subsistence. Some of them now passed over into Britain; others crossed the Pyrenees, and formed settlements in the northern parts of Spain. Even the formidable barrier of the Alps could not impede the progress of the Gauls. They made their way into Italy, and colonized those parts which lie at the foot of these mountains, whence they extended themselves towards the centre of that rich country.

By this time thcGreekshadlandcdon the south-eastern coast of Italy, and founded numerous colonies in those parts. The two nations having each apparently a redundant population, and always planting colonies in the course of their progress, at length met about the middle of the country. This central region was at that period called Latium; and here the two nations formed one society, which was called the Latin people. The languages of both nations were blended together; and hence, according to some, the Latin is a mixture of Greek and of Celtic.

As the Gauls were a brave and numerous people, they certainly maintained themselves in their pristine possessions, uninvaded and unconquered, until their civil animosities and domestic quarrels exposed them as a prey to those very Romans whom they had so often defeated, and sometimes driven to the brink of destruction. They were not a people addicted to commerce; and upon the whole, considering their situation both in their primary seats and afterwards in Italy, they had little temptation or opportunity to intermingle with foreigners. Their language, therefore, must have remained unmixcd with foreign idioms. Such as it was when they settled in Gaul, such it must have continued until the Roman conquests. If therefore there is one primitive language now existing, it must be found in the remains of the Gaulic or Celtic. It is not, then, surprising, that some very learned men, upon discovering the coincidenccof great numbers of words in some of the Greek dialects with other words in the Celtic, have been inclined to establish a strict affinity between these languages. The ancient Pelasgic and the Celtic must at least have nearly resembled each other; admitting only a dialectical difference, and that discrimination which climate and a long period of time must always produce.

Some writers have thought that the Gauls lost the use of their native language soon after their country was conquered by the Romans; but Μ. Bullet, in his Mémoires de la Langue Celtique, has proved almost to demonstration, that the vulgar amongst this people continued to speak it several centuries after that period. When a great and populous nation has for many ages employed a vernacular idiom, nothing can ever make them entirely relinquish the use cf it, and adopt unmixed that of their conquerors.

Many learned men, amongst whom is the lexicographer above mentioned, have shown that all the local names in the north of Italy are actually of Celtic extraction. These names generally point out or describe some circumstances relating to the physical character of the situation; such as exposure, eminence, lowness, moistness, dryness, coldness, heat, and the like. This is a very characteristic feature of an original language; and in the Celtic it is so prominent, that the Erse names of places all over Scotland, are, even to the present day, peculiarly distinguished by this quality. We have heard a gentleman, who was well skilled in that dialect of the Celtic still spoken in the Highlands of Scotland, propose to lay a bet at very great odds, that if anyone should pronounce the name of any village, mountain, river, gentleman’s seat, or other place, in the old Scottish dialect, he would be able, by its very name, to give a pretty exact description of its local situation.

To discover the real sources from which the Celtic language was derived, we must have recourse to various expedients. In the first place, we must consult the Greek and Latin authors, who have preserved some Gaulic or Celtic terms in their writings. Secondly, we must have recourse to the Welsh and Basse Bretagne dialects, in which-, indeed, there are many new words, though these are easily distinguishable from the primitive stock. Thirdly, if we w ould trace another source of the Celtic, we must converse with the country people and peasants, who live at a distance from cities, in those countries where this was once the vernacular tongue. We have been credibly informed, that a Highland gentleman crossing the Alps on his way to Italy, accidentally met with an old woman, a native of those parts, who spoke a language so nearly akin to his native Erse, that he could understand her with little difficulty; and that she, on the other hand, understood most of his words. That an event of this nature should actually take place is by no means surprising, when we consider that the dialect spoken in the Highlands of Scotland is perhaps the most genuine remnant of the Celtic now existing, and at the same time reflect that there may be remote cantons amongst those wild and inaccessible mountains, the Alps, where some remains of that tongue may still be preserved. Fourthly, we have said that the most genuine remains of the Gaelic tongue are to be found in the Highlands of Scotland. The reason of this is obvious. The Scottish Highlanders are the unmixed unconquered posterity of the ancient Britons, into whose barren domains the Romans never penetrated; not, we imagine, because they were not able, since they subdued both North and South Wales, equally inaccessible, but because they found no inducement either to excite their ambition or provoke their avarice. Amidst all the revolutions which from time to time shook and convulsed Albion, these mountainous regions were [7:17:415] left to their primitive lords, who, though like their southern progenitors, hospitable in the extreme, did not suffer strangers to reside long amongst them. Their language, accordingly, remained unmixed, and in a great measure continues so even unto this day, especially in the most remote parts and unfrequented islands.

The Norwegians subdued the western islands of Scotland, at a time when the Scottish monarchy was still in its minority; and the same people erected a kind of principality over them, of which the Isle of Man was the capital. But though they maintained the sovereignty of these islands for some centuries, built many forts, which they strengthened with garrisons, and were the lawgivers and administrators of justice amongst the natives, yet we have been informed by the most respectable authority, that there is not at this day a single term of the Norse or Danish language to be found in use amongst these islanders. This fact demonstrates the superstitious attachment with which they adhered to their vernacular dialect.

The Welsh dialect cannot, we should think, be pure and unsophisticated. The Silures were conquered by the Romans, to whom they were actually subject for the space of three centuries. During this period a multitude of Italian exotics must have been transplanted into their language; and indeed many of them are discernible at this day. Their long commerce with their English neighbours and conquerors has also adulterated their language, so that a great part of it is now of an English complexion. The Irish is still spoken by a large portion of the native population of Ireland. The historians of that country have brought the Milesian race from the confines of Asia, through a variety of adventures, to people an island extra anni solisquc vias. But however much this genealogical fable may please the people for whom it was fabricated, we may still suspect that the Irish are of Celtic extraction, and that their forefathers emigrated from the western coast of Britain at a period anterior to all historical or even traditional annals. Ireland was once the native land of saints; and the principal actors on this sacred stage were Romanists, deeply tinctured with the superstition of the times. They pretended to improve the language of the natives; and whatever their success may have been, they improved it in such a manner as to make it deviate very considerably from the original Celtic; so that it is not in Ireland that we are to look for the genuine characters of the language which we are now considering.

Though, in our opinion, the Hibernian dialect differs considerably from the original Celtic, yet some very ingenious essays have been published by the learned and laborious members of Antiquarian Society of Dublin, in which the coincidence of that idiom with some of the oriental dialects, has been supported by very plausible arguments. Ina dissertation published in the year 1772, the authors have exhibited a collection οCPunico-Maltese words compared with words of the same import in Irish, and it must be allowed that in these the resemblance is palpable. In the same dissertation they have compared the celebrated Punic scene in Plautus with its translation into the Irish, and shown that the words in the two languages are surprisingly similar. If these criticisms are well founded, they tend to prove that the Celtic is coeval and congenial with the most ancient languages of the East; a conclusion which we think highly probable. But however this maybe, the Danes and Norwegians formed settlements in Ireland; and the English have long been the sovereigns of that island. These circumstances must have affected the vernacular idiom of the natives, and not to mention the necessity which the people were under of adopting the language of the conquerors in law, in sciences, and in the offices of religion, they must have contributed much to impair its original purity.

The inhabitants of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland are the descendants of those Britons who fled from the power of the Romans, and sheltered themselves amongst the rocks and fastnesses of those rugged mountains and sequestered glens. They preferred the wastes and wilds of the north, with liberty and independence, to the pleasant and fertile valleys of the south, where plenty was embittered by slavery. They no doubt carried their language along with them, and that language was a branch of the Celtic. With them, probably, fled a number of the druidical priests,^[20. The probability here assumed cannot very easily be admitted, because we have little else than conjecture to guide us, Mr. Malcolm Laing, in his Dissertation on Ossian, has shown that the opinion expressed in the text is altogether unsupported by any thing deserving the name of evidence; be even contends, that the probability is strongly the other way; and those ancient remains, which have so often been appealed to, as favouring the opinion in question, are considered as of Runic, not Druidical origin. Besides, in the traditional superstitions of the Highlands, there is nothing as far as we kuow, accords with the account given by Caesar of the religious rites practised by the British Druids· ] who unquestionably knew their native dialect in all its beauties and varieties. In process of time these fugitives formed a regular government, elected a king, and became a considerable state. They were sequestered by their situation from the rest of the world. Without commerce, without agriculture, without the mechanical arts, and without objects of ambition or emulation, they addicted themselves wholly to the pastoral life as their business, and to hunting and fishing as their diversion. This people were not distinguished by an innovating genius; and consequently their language must have remained in the same state in which they received it from their ancestors. They received it genuine Celtic, and such they preserved it.

When the Scots had become masters of the low country, and their kings with a great part of the nobility embraced the Saxon manners, and adopted the Saxon language, the genuine Caledonians still tenaciously retained tiιeir native dialect, dress, manners, clanships, and feudal customs, and never cordially assimilated with their southern neighbours. Their language, therefore, could not be polluted with words or idioms borrowed from a people whom they hated and despised. Indeed, it is plain from the whole tenor of the Scottish history, that neither Caledonian chiefs, nor their vassals were ever steadily attached to the royal family after they fixed their residence in the low country, and became Sassenach, as the Highlanders called them by way of reproach. Indeed, the commerce between them and those of the south, till about a century and a half ago, was only transient and accidental; nor was their native dialect in any material degree affected by this casual intercourse.

Their language, however, did not degenerate, because there existed amongst them a description of men whose profession obliged them to guard against that misfortune. Every chief retained in his family a bard or poet laureate, whose province it was to compose poems in honour of his lord, to commemorate the glorious exploits of his ancestors, and to record the genealogy and connections of the family; in a word, to amuse and entertain the chief and his guests at all public entertainments, and upon all solemn occasions. These professors of the poetical art used to contend with each other; and the chiefs of families often assembled their respective bards, and encouraged them by considerable premiums to exert their poetical talents. The victor was rewarded and honoured; and the chief deemed it an honour to himself to entertain a bal’d who excelled his brethren in song. The ancient Gauls, as we learn from Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Tacitus, Lucan, and others, entertained persons of that profession; and certainly the ancient Britons did the same. The bards were highly revered; their persons were deemed sacred; and they were always rewarded with salaries in lands or in cattle. The members of this tuneful fraternity must [7:17:416] have watched over their vernacular dialect with the greatest care and anxiety; because in their compositions no word was to be lost, and as many as possible gained.

The use of letters was not known amongst the ancient Cel~ tae ; indeed their druidical clergy forbade the use of them. All their religious rites, their philosophical dogmas, their moral precepts, and their political maxims, were composed in verses which their pupils were obliged to commit to memory. Accordingly letters were unknown to the Caledonian Scots, till they learned them either from their southern neighbours, or from the Romans. The Irish, indeed, pretend to have letters of a very ancient date; but the Highlanders of the country in question make no claim to the use of that invention. Their bards, therefore, committed every thing to memory; and consequently the words of their language must have been faithfully preserved.

In order to exhibit the genius of the Celtic in as striking a light as the nature of our present design will permit, we shall lay before our readers a very short sketch or outline of the Gaelic or Caledonian dialect as it now stands; which, we trust, will go a great way to convince them that the latter is the genuine offspring of the other. In doing this we shall borrow many hints from the work of a gentleman^[21. The writer here referred to is Mr. Grant, whose Essays contain much curious information on the subject of which this section treats. ] whose learning seems to have equalled his zeal for his native language, which, in compliance with the modern practice, we shall for the future distinguish by the name of Gaelic.

The Gaelic, then, is not as far as we know derived from any other language, being obviously reducible to its own roots. Its combinations are formed of simple words of a known signification; and these words arc resolvable into the simplest combinations of vowels and consonants, and even into simple sounds. In such a language we may expect that some traces will be found of the ideas and notions of mankindlivingin astate of primitive simplicity; and if so,a monument is still preserved of the original manners of the Celtic race whilst as yet under the guidance of simple nature, without any artificial restraint or control.

The sudden sensations of heat and cold, and bodily pain, are expressed by articulate sounds, which, however, are not used in this language to denote heat, cold, or bodily pain. A sudden sensation of heat is denoted by an articulate exclamation hait ; of cold, by id; of bodily pain, by oich. All these sounds may be called interjections, being parts of speech which discover that the mind is affected by some passion. Few of the improved languages of Europe present so great a variety of sounds which instantaneously convey notice of a particular passion, of bodily pain or mental feeling.

The pronouns he and she are expressed by the simple sounds e and ⅛ and these again are the marks of the masculine and feminine genders; for the neuter gender isquiteunknown in the Gaelic. The compositions of rude and barbarous ages are universally found to approach to the style and numbers of poetry; and this too is a distinguishing character of the Gaelic. The means of subsistence must always be the principal concern of an uncultivated people. Accordingly ed or eid is used upon the discovery of any animal of prey or game, and is meant to give notice to the hunting companion to be in readiness to seize the animal; and hence edo to eat in Latin, ed in Irish, signifying cattle, and edal in Scotch, literally signifying the offspring or generation of cattle. Coed or cued, a share or portion of any subject of property, is literally common food; faced, hunting, literally gathering of food; edra, the time of the morning when cattle are brought home from pasture to be milked, literally meal-time. These are words importing the simplicity of a primitive state, and are common in the Gaelic idiom. Traces of imitative language may alsobe found in all countries.

The word used for cow in the Gaelic language is bo, plainly in imitation of the lowing of that animal.

In joining together original roots in the progress of improving language and rendering it more copious, its combinations discover an admirable justness and precision of thought, which one would scarcely have expected to find in an uncultivated dialect. Upon examination, however, it will be discovered that the Gaelic language, in its combinations of words, specifies with accuracy the known qualities, and expresses with precision the nature and properties which were attributed to the object denominated. An, for instance, appears to have been a word of frequent use in this language, and seems to have been originally a name applied indefinitely to any object. According to Bullet, it was employed to signify a planet; and hence the sun had the name of griαη, which is a compound of gri, hot, and an a planet. Re signifies originally and radically division. The changes of the moon and the variety of her phases were early employed to indicate the divisions of time. The present name for the moon is geulach, a word derived from her whiteness of colour. To these we might add a vast number more, the signification of which precisely indicates their shape, colour, effects, or other accidents. Many of these would be found exactly similar to Greek and Latin words of the same sound and signification. In order to satisfy our curious readers, we shall annex a few, though some of them may perhaps be questionable.

The Venus of the Latins is supposed to be a compound of ben and jus, which literally signify the first woman, the letter b in Gaelic being softened into v. Eδαp and dδαp signify food. These words are compounded of the Gaelic words ed or eid and ar, the former simply denoting food, and the latter ploughed land ; and they are the roots of the Greek and Latin words eδω, edo ; αpoω, aro. Εδρα, which signifies a seat, has also an evident reference to food. It is compounded of two Gaelic words ed and ira, which literally signify mealtime. Eδι>α, which signifies the presents that a bridegroom made to his bride, is a compound of two Gaelic words ed and ηa or nuah, literally signifying raw food. From ar there are many Greek derivatives. Αρουρα signifies ploughedland, and also a crop of corn; and àpros means bread. In Gaelic a crop of corn and bread are expressed by arbhar, which is commonly pronounced arar and aran, both being equally derivatives of the root ar. So the Greek and Latin words apoτοs, arabilis, arable; αpoτpov, aratrum, a plough; αporηρ, arator, a ploughman; and many others, are evidently derived from the same source. From this coincidence, however, we are not υrepared to maintain that either the Greek or the Latin languages were derived from the Gaelic; we are rather inclined to think that these are remains of a primeval tongue, which are still retained in all the three, and we produce them upon the present occasion as presumptions that the Gaelic is an original, un derived language, and of course the most pure and unadulterated relic of the Celtic now existing.^[22. If our readers should incline to know more of this subject, they may consult Pezron’s Oτiyiη of Anáent Nations, Bullet’s Mémoires de la Langue Celtique, Parson’s Rem. of Japhet, and Gebelin’s Monde Primitif. ]

When the Celtic language was generally spoken throughout Europe, it seems to have been amazingly copious. By consulting Bullet’s Mémoires, it will be seen that its names for the common and various objects of nature were very numerous. The words denoting water, river, wood, forest, mountain, lake, and other natural objects, were most precisely accommodated to specify each modification and variety, with such peculiar exactness that even the Greek, witlιall its boasted idiomatical precision and copiousness, has not been able to equal it. The appearances which diversify the visible face of animated nature, arrest the attention of men in an uncultivated state. Unaccustomed to thought and abstract reasoning, their minds expandandexcrcisetheirpowers [7:17:417] upon sensible objects, and of course mark every minute and almost imperceptible distinction with an accuracy which to us seems impossible. It therefore appears to us, that the Celtic formed one of the dialects of the primitive language; thatanciently it overspread byfar thegreatest partofEurope; and that the Gaelic now spoken in the northern parts of Scotland and the adjacent islands is the purest and most unmixed relic of that language anywhere existing at the present time.

We would willingly refer our readers to some well arranged Gaelic grammar; but in point of fact wc know of none which deserves particular recommendation. That by Dr. Stewart, however, is the best of its class, and considering the difficulty of the undertaking, it must be regarded as a creditable performance, notwithstanding its deficiency in philosophical precision, and simplicity of arrangement. The Dictionary of the Highland Society, in two volumes quarto, and that by Dr. Armstrong, in one volume of the same size, though neither of them, perhaps, what could in all respects be desired, must, nevertheless, afford great facilities to the student of Gaelic.^[23. The Dictionary of the Highland Society is executed with great ability to the extent of between two-thirds and three-fourths of the whole; but the subsequent portion betrays that it had fallen into inferior hands; and some of the Latin definitions are such as can scarcely fail to astonish the accurate scholars of the Continent. The death of Mr. Maclachlan, of Aberdeen, the original conductor, proved a great calamity to the work. Equally eminent as a classical, oriental, and Celtic scholar, and profoundly learned in philology, his place could not be supplied; and though occasional assistance was obtained from men equally conversant with Latin and with Celtic, such as the late Rev. Mr. Macdonald of Crieff, the elegant author of the Plιiηgαleis, yet the master mind was removed, and the work suffered in consequence. Still, with all its acknowledged defects, it is a valuable present to the philologist as well as the scholar, and does honour to the liberal and patriotic spirit of the National Association under whose auspices it was brought out. ] These works, together with the excellent translation of both the Old and New Testaments into Gaelic, which was long a great desideratum amongst the Highlanders, many of whom are still unacquainted with English, will contribute to preserve their ancient tongue, and to disseminate the knowledge of the truth amongst the natives of the mountains.

Every assistance towards acquiring the knowledge of a language which was once diffused over a great part of Europe, is certainly an acceptable present to the public. The antiquary, who is desirous of tracing the affinity of languages, and who wishes to mark the migrations of different races, ought to apply himself to the study of its remaining branches; and, if we are not mistaken, he will soon be convinced, that they all breathe a spirit congenial to the manners and sentiments of people who are just entering upon the first stage of improvement and civilization.

Perhaps it may be expected, that, before we conclude this short sketch of the Celtic language, we should give some account of the origin of the words Gaul and Gal, the two names by which this people were distinguished by the Greeks and Romans. Mr. Macpherson imagines, that the appellation of Celt is an adjective derived from Gael, the aboriginal name of the inhabitants of ancient Gaul. For our part, we can see no connection whatever between Gael and Kelt, nor do we think that the latter is an adjective. We believe that this people called themselves Gael and not Gael; and there is little room for doubt that Caledonia, that is, Cal-doη or Cal-dun, was an ancient name of the mountainous parts of Scotland.

Though many different opinions have been advanced respecting the etymology of this word, we imagine that none is so probable as that which supposes that it is compounded of the two Celtic words, Cal or Kal, that is, Gal or Gaul, and dun, which signifies a hill or mountain. Upon this ground, the Caledones will import the Gauls of the mountains, or which is the same, the Highland Gauls. The Irish and Highlanders reciprocally denominate themselves Cael, Gael, or Gauls. They also distinguish themselves, as the Welsh originally did, and as the Welsh distinguish them both at present, by the appellation of Guidhill, Guethel, and Gathel. The intermediate th, they say, is left quiescent in the pronunciation, as it is in many words of the British language, so that Gathel would immediately be formed into Gael; and Gathel is actually sounded like G⅛eZboth by the Irish and by the Highlanders. The appellation of Gathel, therefore, say they, was originally the same with Gael, and the parent of it. The quiescent letters in the British are frequently transferred from the middle to the conclusion of the word; by which means Gathel is changed into Galath, Galat, Galt, and Celt. It is true, that the Gael of the continent are universally denominated Galatae and Celtaeby the Grecians,and Gallt and Gallta↑iy the Irish. The appellations, therefore, of Gathel-i, Galli, Gallat-ae, Calet-es, An-calit-es, and Celt-ae, are all one and the same denomination, only varied by the astonishing ductility of the Celtic, and disguised by the alterations ever incident to a language which has for ages been merely oral.^[24. We must caution our readers, however, not to confound Gael with Gal or Gall, which, in the Celtic, signifies a stranger. ]

It may perhaps appear presumptuous in us to differ from two such respectable authorities as Macpherson and Whitaker; but we must, nevertheless, acknowledge, that neither the one nor the other appears to us to be well founded in his views. Besides, they convey no idea of the signification of the words, though in the Celtic language these must have been significant. The name Cael, the same with Gal, was probably given them in the East from the Greek καλ, which in many oriental languages denotes fair ; and γαλατία may be easily derived from γdλ or γαλαθ, Gal or Galath ; a denomination which might be given them by their neighbours, in allusion to their fair complexion.

§ 2.— Of the Gothic Language.

The Celtic and Gothic languages at one period divided Europe between them. Both were of equal antiquity, both originated in Asia, and both were dialects of the original language of mankind. The Celtic, however, was first imported into Europe. The Gauls or Celts had penetrated farthest towards the west, a circumstance which plainly intimates the priority of their arrival. In the population of countries, it may be held as a maxim, that the colonies who first emigrated were generally impelled by succeeding emigrants; and that consequently the most early were pushed forward to the parts most distant. The Celts, then, having overspread the most western parts of Europe, must have been the first who established themselves in those regions.

The Goths and Getae were the same race of people, according to Procopius^[25. De Bello Gothico, lib i. c∙ 2. ]; and Strabo informs us, that they spoke the same language with the Thracians, from whose confines they had spread themselves northward as far as the western banks of the Danube.^[26. Lib. ii. cap. 23. ] Vopiscus, in the History of Probus, tells us, that this emperor obliged “the Thracians, and all the Getic tribes, either to surrender or accept of his friendship,” an expression which indicates, that the Thracians and the Getic tribes were deemed the same race of people.^[27. Lib. vii. p. 295; ibid. p. 305, Casaubon. From this passage it appears, that the Greeks were of opinion that the Getae were Thracians. Pliny (Nat. Hist. lib. iv. cap. 11.) mentions a tribe of the Getae called Gaudoe. ] From this deduction then, it is clear, that the Getae and Thracians were brethren, andspokethe same language ;— and that their laws, manners, customs, and religious tenets, were the same, might easily be shewn, were this the proper [7:17:418] place for such an inquiry. The Thracian language, as might be démonstrated from names of persons, offices, places, and customs, amongst the people who spoke it, was nearly related to the Chaldaic and other oriental languages.

The Goths arc thought to have been the descendants of Tiras, one of the sons of Japhet, and consequently must have preserved the speech of the Noachic family. The Gothic language abounds with Pahlavi, or old Persian words, which are no doubt remains of the primitive dialect of mankind. The Thracians peopled a considerable part of the northern coast of Asia Minor; and consequently we meet with many names of cities, mountains, rivers, and other objects in those parts, exactly corresponding with many names in Europe, evidently imposed by our Gothic progenitors. These any person tolerably acquainted with the remains of the Gothic language, will be able to trace with little difficulty.

We learn from Herodotus,^[28. Lib. iv. passim. ] that Darius in his expedition against the wandering Scythians who lived on the other side of the Ister or Danube, subdued in his progress the Getae; and in the same passage the historian informs us, that this people held the immortality of the human soul, and were the bravest and justest of all the Thracians. After this period, we find them mentioned familiarly by almost every Greek writer; for, in the comedies of that nation, Gcta is a common name for a slave. The Getae then occupied all that large tract of country which extended from the confines of Thrace to the banks of the Danube; they were a brave and virtuous people, who spoke the same language as the Thracians, with whom they are often confounded both by the Greek and the Roman historians. But the name of Goths is not by any means so ancient. It was utterly unknown to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The first time that the name Goth is mentioned is in the reign of the emperor Decius, about the year of Christ 250. About that period they had burst out of Getia, and rushing like a torrent into the empire, laid waste every thing with fire and sword. The name of their leader or king was Cneva ; andDecius,in endeavouring to expel them from Thrace, was vanquished and slain.

After this irruption, we find them frequently mentioned by the Latin authors under the namcof G⅛i<≡or Gothi, though the Greeks generally denominate them Scythae. Torfaeus tells us, that get and got are in reality the same word, and according to him, anciently denoted a soldier.^[29. History of Norway, lib· i. ] Got in Icelandic signifies a horse or horseman, and gata a wanderer; and this was perhaps the import of the term Geta, because the Getae were originally an unsettled and vagrant people. As nations generally assume to themselves some high and auspicious denomination, it may be presumed that the Goths did the same. We may therefore be satisfied, thatthe Getae assumed the Icelandic name above mentioned as their national one; or perhaps, that, notwithstanding their Greek denomination, they from the beginning called themselves Gots or Goths.

The original seat of the Goths was the country now called Little Tartary, into which they had extended themselves from the frontiers of Thrace. This country was called Little Scythia by the Greek writers; and it was the station whence those innumerable swarms advanced, which, in conjunction with the Alani and other barbarous tribes, at length overran and subverted the western empire. One part of the Gothic nation was allowed by Constantine to settle in Moesia. Before the year 420 of our era, most of the Gothic nations who had settled within the limits of the Roman empire had been converted to the Christian faith; but, unhappily, the greater part of the apostles by whom they had been proselytized were Arians; and this proved fatal to many of the orthodox Christians, whom the Arian Goths persecuted with unrelenting cruelty.

About the year 367, Ulphilas, bishop of the Moesian Goths, translated the New Testament into the language of that peo ple. The remains of this translation furnish a genuine, and at the same time a venerable, monument of the ancient Gothic dialect. Of that valuable translation no more is now extant than the four Gospels, and another fragment containing part of the epistle to the Romans. The Gospels have been repeatedly published since the first edition by Junius which appeared in the year 1665. There have also been discovered other fragments of the Gothic language which the curious reader may find in Lye’s notes to his edition of the Gothic Gospels. The fragment of the Epistle to the Romans was discovered in the library at Wolfenbuttle, and published by Knitel arch-deacon of Wolfenbuttle, as has been fully explained in another article of this work (Palimpsests). Prior to the age of Ulphilas, the Goths were ignorant of the use of alphabetical characters. But that bishop fabricated for them an alphabet, which consists of a medley of Greek and Roman letters, though rather inclining to the former.

The Gothic alphabet is composed of twenty-five letters. Junius has carefully analyzed these letters, and pointed out their powers and sounds, in the alphabet prefixed to his Glossarium Gothicum. They were long retained in all the European languages which acknowledged the Gothic as the source whence they had been derived, and which will be enumerated in the sequel.

What kind of language the ancient Gothic really was, may be inferredfrom the fragments above mentioned; but in what respects it agrees with the oriental tongues, or differs from them, is not easy to ascertain with precision. In the section on the Greek, we have observed that a considerable part of that language must have been derived from the Thracian, which, according to Strabo, was the same with the Getic or Gothic; and we are convinced that the Thracian language will, on comparison, be found analogous to the Chaldaic or Syriac. The German, which is a genuine descendant of the Gothic, is full of Persian words; and the old Persian or Pahlavi appears to have been a dialect of the Chaldaic. Junius, in his treatise on the Gothic alphabet, remarks that a very considerable part of the Gothic language is borrowed from the most ancient Greek; but, perhaps, it would have been nearer the truth, if he had reversed this observation, and stated that the ancient Greek was in a great measure derived from the Gothic.

The learned Ihre in his Glossarium Suio-Gothieum, and Wachter in his excellent German and Latin Dictionary, remark the coincidence of Gothic and German words with oriental nouns of a similar sound and the same signification. In the old Saxon, which is another ramification from theGothic stem, numberless terms of the very same complexion appear. Hence it appears that the Gothic in its original and unmixed state as spoken by the ancient Getae, was a dialect of the primeval language, which the sons of Tiras had brought with them from the plains of Shinar, Armenia, or some other region, where “the world’s grey fathers” had fixed their residence.

The Thracian tribes, in all probability, first took possession of those parts of Asia Minor which stretch towards the east; and thence crossing the Hellespont, they spread themselves northward. Strabo supposes that they first settled in the regions to the north of this strait, and thence transported numerous colonies into Asia Minor. The reverse was probably the case; but be this as it may, it is universally agreed, that both sides of the Hellespont were at one time peopled with Thracians.

In Asia Minor we meet with the city Perga, which, throwing away the a, is Perg. But in every tongue descended from the Gothic, the word Berg signifies a rock, and metaphorically a town or burgh, because towns were originally built upon rocks for the sake of defence. Hence likewise Pergamus, the fort or citadel of Troy. Beira, in Thracian,signified [7:17:419] a city; whilst the Chaldaic and Hebrew word Peer imports a well, and is possibly the original of the Gothic word beer, ale. In ancient times, especially in the East, it was customary to build cities in the neighbourhood of fountains. The ancients called the Phrygians Bpvy«, Bryges, or Bruges, a name which is obviously of Gothic origin. Thjndymus, the name of a city sacred to Cybele, is compounded of two Gothic words dun and durn, both signifying a height or an eminence, and hence a town or an inclosure. The word tros seems to be the Gothic word trosh, signifying brave, valiant. The words fader, rηader, dοchter, brader, are so obviously Persian, that almost every etymologist has assigned them to that language.

Many fiιtile etymologies have been given of the sacred name God, which is in reality the Persian word Choda, commonly applied by them to their Hormuzd or Oromasdes. The Persian bad or bod signifies a city; and the same word in Gothic imports a house, a mansion, an abode. Band, in Persian, is a strait place; in Gothic, it signifies to bend. Heim or ham, a house, is generally known to be of Persian origin. Much critical skill has been displayed in tracing the etymology of the Scotch and old English word Yule or Christmas. Yule, derived from iul, was a festival in honour of the sun, which was originally celebrated at the winter solstice. Wick or wich is a Gothic term still preserved in many names of towns; it signifies a narrow corner, or small strip of land jutting into the sea, or into a lake or river; hence the Latin vicus, and Greek φοικοs. In Spanish we have many old Gothic words, and amongst the rest hijo, a son, the same with the Greek iâoj. In some places of Scotland we call any thing that is little, or small, wee, originally spelled wi, which if we mistake not, is formed from the very same word.

These examples we have thrown together, without any regard to order, being persuaded that almost every word of the language, which is truly Gothic, may with a little pains and judgment be traced to some oriental root or cognate term. We may observe in passing, that many Gothic nouns end in α, like the Chaldaic and Syriac; that their substantive verb very much resembles that of the Persian, Greek, and Latin; and that their active and auxiliary verb has,furnished the common preterperfect tense of Greek verbs in the active voice. That verb is haban, but was originally ha, as the common people pronounce itatthis day, especiallyin the north of Scotland, and amongst the Swedes, Danes, Norwegians, and Icelanders.

Leaving the inferior arrangementsof this ancient language to grammarians and lexicographers, we shall now proceed to inquire what modern tongues have been derived from it as their source, and which of them makes the nearest approach to its simplicity and rusticity. We have already observed that the Goths, formerly Getae, were possessed of a vast extent of country, reaching from the frontiers of Thrace to the banks of the Ister or Danube. We have also seen that a colony of them settled in Moesia under Constantine II.; after which they spread themselves throughout Dacia, and thence passed into Germany. All these countries were situated in Such a manner, that the progress of population was commensurate with the natural course of emigration. From Germany they extended themselves into Scandinavia, that is, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. All the ancient Edda, Sagas, and Chronicles, shew that the Goths arrived in Scandinaviaby this route, without, however, fixing the era of that event with any tolerable degree of accuracy. BytheGermans, the ancients most probably understood all the nations eastward, westward, and northward, reaching from the Danube on the south to the extremity of Scandinavia in the northern ocean, and from the Rhine and German ocean on the west, to the river Chronus or Niemen on the east. But all the nations included within these limits spoke one or other ofthe Gothic dialects, some approaching nearer, and others deviating farther from, the parent language.

TheFrancic is plainly a dialect ofthe Teutonic, Tudesque, or old German; and the Gospels of Ulphilas bear such a resemblance to the Francic, fragments of which are preserved in the early French historians, that some learned men have pronounced these gospels part of an old Francic version; but others of equal respectability have refuted this opinion, both from history and a comparison of the dialects. Schilter has given us several specimens of the Tudesque or old German in the seventh century, which evidently prove that the Gothic of Ulphilas is the same language; and Wachter’s learned glossary of the ancient German confirms the position of Schilter. Ihre, after hesitating whether the Gospels of Ul-philasbear most resemblance to the Germanor Scandinavian dialect of the Gothic, declares at last in favour of the former. The Anglo-Saxon is also known to be a venerable dialect of the Tudesque; and is so intimately connected with the gospels, that some valuable works on this subject are wholly built upon that supposition.

The Icelandic is the most ancient relic of the Scandinavian. It begins with Arius Frode in the eleventh century, and is a dialect of the German. The remains we have of it are more modern by four centuries than those of the German; and they are also more polished. The words are shortened, not only because they are more modern than the German, but because the Icelandic was polished by a long succession of poets and historians almost equal to that which does so much honour to Greece and Rome. Hence the Icelandic, being a more polished language than the German, has less affinity with the parent Gothic. The Swedish is more nearly related to tbe Icelandic than either the Danish or Norwegian. That the Swedish is the daughter of the Gothic, hasbeen very clearly shewn by Ihre, in his Glossarium Suio-Gothicum. There is, therefore, no manner of doubt as to the identity of the Gothic, preserved in Ulphilas and other ancient remains, with the German and Scandinavian tongue. The modern German, resembles the Gothic Gospels more than the present Danish, Norwegian, or Swedish, and has certainly more ancientstamrwα. Itsresemblance to the Asiatic tongues, in harshness and inflexible thickness of sound, is likewise very apparent.^[30. It is a pity that the learned author of this treatise did not pursue the ingenious and profound thought which here suggested itself to his mind. If he had done so, he would, beyond all question, have anticipated the continental philologists in the discovery of a new principle of classifying languages, and more particularly in separating from the mass that great family which has been so aptly denominated Indo-European. But all the elements of the new classification are to be found in the present treatise. The affinity of the Greek and the Gothic, the parentage of the old German, and the oriental origin of both, are as distinctly intimated as in any of the works of Klaproth or his contemporaries; and if the author had known Sanscrit, he would, at the first glance, have anticipated the most important discovery which has rewarded the philological research of the nineteenth century. ]

Busbequius shews that the peasantry of Crim Tartary, who are remains of the ancient Goths, speak a language almost German. These peasants were no doubt descendants of the ancient Goths, who remained in their native country after the others had emigrated. It is therefore apparent from the whole of this investigation, that the Gothic was introduced into Europe from the East, and that it is probably a dialect of the language originally spoken by the founders of human society.

§ 3.— Of the Sclαvonian Language.

There is another language which pervades a considerable part of Europe, and which, like the Gothic, seems to have originated in the East. The language we allude to is the Sclavonic or rather Slavonic, which prevails to a great extent in the eastern parts of this division of the globe. It is spoken by the Dalmatians, by the inhabitants of the Danubian provinces[7:17:420], by the Pôles, Bohemians, and Russians. The word slab, that is, slave, whence the French word esclave, and our word slave, signifies noble, illustrious; but because in the lower ages of the Roman empire, vast multitudes of this people were spread over all Europe in the quality of slaves, that word came to denote the servile tribe by way of distinction, in the same manner as the words Geta, Davus, and Syrus, did amongst the Greeks at a more early period.

The Slavi dwelt originally upon the banks of the Borysthenes, now called the Dnieper or Nieper. They were one of the tribes of the European Sarmatians, who in ancient times inhabited an immense tract of country, bounded on the west by the Vistula, and on the south-east by the Euxine or Black Sea, the Bosphorus Cimmerius, the Palus Maeotis, and the Tanais or Don, which divides Europe from Asia. In this vast tract of country 7 , there dwelt aboriginally many considerable tribes. To enumerate these, however, would not much edify our readers; andweshall only inform them, that amongst the Sarmatian clans were the Roxolani, now the Russians, and likewise the Slavi, who dwelt near the Borysthenes. The Slavi gradually advanced towards the Danube; and in the reign of Justinian having passed that river, they made themselves masters ofthat portion of Illyricum which lies between the Drave and the Save, and is to this day called Sclavoniα. By degrees these barbarians overran Dalmatia, Liburnia, the western parts of Macedonia, and Epirus; and on the east they extended their conquests to the western bank of the Danube, where that river falls into the Euxine. In all these countries the Sclavonian was deeply impregnated with the Greek; which indeed was a matter of course, as the barbarian invaders settled in these regions, and mingled with the aborigines, who spoke a corrupt dialect of the Greek language.

The Poles are the genuine descendants of the ancient Sarmatians,^[31. This appears by their character, their laws, their manners, their form of government, their military equipage, their impetuosity, their aristocratic splendour. ] and consequently speak a dialect of the language of that race, though much adulterated with Latin words, in consequence of the attachment this people have long professed to the Roman tongue. The Silesians andBohemians have corrupted their dialects in a similar manner. In these countries, then, we are not to search for the genuine remainsof the ancient Sarmatian.

The modern Russians, formerly called Rhoxani or Roxolani, are the posterity of the Sarmatae, and constitute a branch of the Slavi. They inhabit a part of the country which that people possessed before they fell into the Roman provinces; they also speak the same language, and wear the very same dress. If then the Slavi are Sarmatae, the Russians must of course be the descendants of the same people. They were long a sequestered people, and consequently altogether unconnected with the other nations of Europe. They were unacquainted with commerce, inhospitable to strangers, tenacious of ancient usages, averse to improvements of every kind, wonderfully proud of their imaginary importance, and, in a word, a race of men just one degree above absolute barbarism. A people of this character are, for the most part, enemies to innovations; and if we may believe the Russian historians, no nation was ever more averse to changes than their own. From the ninth century, at which era they embraced Christianity, it does not appear that they moved one step forward towards civilization, until Peter the Great, little more than a century ago, compelled them by his despotic authority to adopt the manners and customs of their more polished neighbours.

We may then conclude, that, during the period in question, the Russians made as little change in their language as they appear to have done in their dress, habits, and manner of living. Whatever language they spoke in the ninth century, the same they employed at the beginning of the eighteenth. They were, indeed, according to Appian, once conquered by Diophantus, a general of Mithridates; but that conquest was for a moment only. They were likewise invaded, and their country was overrun, by the great Timur or Tamerlane; but this invasion proved like a torrent from the mountains, which spreads devastation far and wide whilst it rages, but makes little alteration on the face of the country. We find, likewise, that upon some occasions they made incursions upon the frontiers of the Roman empire; but we hear of no permanent settlements formed by them in the countries which they overran. Upon the whole, the Russians, with respect to their language, were in nearly the same predicament with the Highlanders and Islanders of Scotland, who, according to the general opinion, have preserved the Celtic dialect pure and entire, solely from their never having mingled with foreigners.

From this deduction we may infer two things; first, that the Russian language is the genuine Sclavonian; and, secondly, that the latter is the same, or nearly the same, with the ancient Sarmatian. In the Russian, there are found a great number of words resembling, both in sound and signification, the old simple roots of the Greek; its grammatical genius is nearly the same; and we are informed by the very best authority, that there exists in this language a translation of Epictetus, in which there are whole pages, both in the original and the translation, without one single transposition. Μ. Lévêque, who published a translation of a history of Russia, was so entirely convinced of the strict analogy between the ancient Greek and the modern Russian, that he became positive as to the former having been derived from the latter. Μ. Fréret, a very learned French academician, also adopted the same opinion. We are persuaded, however, that this opinion is ill-founded, and rather conceive, that these coincidences arise from the relics of the primitive language of mankind, vestiges of which, we believe, are to be found almost in every tongue now extant.

It is, however, we admit, exceedingly difficult to render a reason for the syntaxical analogy of the two languages, without admitting the truth of the one or other of the hypotheses mentioned. We have examined with some care a goodly number of Russian words, and compared them with Greek words of the same signification; but we have not found such a resemblance as we consider necessary to support the position above advanced. We have indeed discovered a very strong resemblance between the former and many oriental words, especially Hebrew, Chaldaic, and old Persian, of which we could produce several instances, did the nature of our present inquiry admit such a deviation. Everybody knows that the Sarmatians were divided into two great nations, the Asiatic and the European. The former extended very far to the eastward, behind the mountain Caucasus, the northern shore of the Euxine Sea, and probably derived their language from the original form of speech long before the Greek language existed. But this, in comparison with the Hebrew, Phoenician, Egyptian, Arabian, and Chaldean, was but of yesterday. The Greek, most learned men are now convinced, was a late composition of many different dialects, incorporated with the jargon of the aboriginal Ionim or Greeks. The Sarmatian, on the contrary, was the language of a great and populous nation, civilized, in all appearance, long before the Greeks began to emerge from a state of barbarism. We are, therefore, by no means disposed to allow, either that the Greek is derived from the Russian, or that the Russian is derived from the Greek. We believe there is just the same reason for this conclusion, that the Abbé Pezron and Μ. Gebelin pretend to have discovered, for supporting their position that the Greek is derived from the Celtic. Certain it is, that the resemblance amongst the oriental languages, of which we conceive the Sarmatian to [7:17:421] have been one, is so palpable, that any person of moderate capacity who is perfectly master of one, will find but little difficulty in acquiring any other. If, therefore, the coincidence between the Greek and Russian should actually exist, we think this circumstance will not authenticate the supposition, that either of the two is derived from the other.

In the course of this argument, our readers will be pleased to observe, that we all along suppose, that the Sclavonian, of which we think the Russian is the most genuine remain, is the same with the old Sarmatian. We shall now take the liberty to hazard a conjecture with respect to the syntaxical coincidence of that language with the Greek; for we acknowledge that we are not so profoundly versed in the Russian dialect of the Sclavonian as to pretend to pronounce a definitive sentence.

As the Russians were a generation of savages, there is no probability that they were acquainted with the use of letters and alphabetical writing until they acquired that art by intercourse with their neighbours. It is certain that few nations had made less proficiency in the fine arts; and there is little appearance of their having learned this art previously to their conversion to Christianity. It appears, indeed, that the Slavi, who settled in Dalmatia, Illyria, and Liburnia, had no alphabetical characters till these were furnished with them by St. Jerome. The Servian character, which very nearly resembles the Greek, was invented by St. Cyril; and on this account the language written in that character is denominated Chiurilizza. But these Sclavonic tribes knew nothing of alphabetical writing prior to the era of their conversion; and the Moesian Goths were in the same condition till their bishop Ulphilas fabricated for them a set of letters. If, then, the Slavi and Goths, who resided in the neighbourhood of the Greeks and Romans, had not learned alphabetical writing prior to the era of their conversion to Christianity, it follows, a fortiori, that the Russians, who lived at a great distance from these nations, knew nothing of this useful art antecedent to the period of their embracing the Christian faith.

The Russians pretend that they were converted by St. Andrew; but this is known to be a fable. Christianity was first introduced amongst them in the reign of the grand duke Woladimir, who having married the daughter of the Greek emperor, Basilius, became her convert about the year 989. About this period they were taught the knowledge of letters by the Grecian missionaries, who were employed in teaching them the elements of the Christian doctrines. Their alphabet consists of thirty-one letters, with a few obsolete additional ones; and these characters resemble so exactly those of the Greeks that there can be no doubt of their being copied from them. It is true, the shape of several has been somewhat altered, and a few barbarous characters have been intermingled. The Russian liturgy, as every body knows, was copied from that of the Greeks; and the best specimen of the old Russian is to be found in the church offices for Easter, which are in the very words of Chrysostom, who is called by his name 7Λαto ustii, or golden-mouthed. The power of the clergy in Russia was excessive; and their influence was, no doubt, proportioned to their power. The first race of clergy in that country were undoubtedly Greeks, because we know how active and industrious that people were in propagating their language as well as their religion. The offices of religion might at first be written and pronounced in the Greek language, but it would soon be found expedient to have them translated into Russian; and the persons employed in this work must have been Greeks, who understood both languages.

As it is confessedly impossible that a people so dull and inattentive as the Russians originally were, could ever have fabricated a language so artificially constructed as their present dialect; and as it is obvious, that, until Christianity was introduced amongst them by the Greeks, they could have no correspondence with that people; it must appear surprising by what means their language came to be fashioned so exactly according to the Greek model. We have observed above, that the Russian letters must have been invented and introduced into that country by the Greek missionaries; and we think it probable, that these apostles, at the same time that they taught them a new religion, likewise introduced a change into the idiom of their language. The influence of these ghostly teachers over a nation of savages must have been almost boundless, the force of their precepts and example almost uncontrollable. But if the rude and savage converts accepted a new religion from the hands of Grecian apostles, they might with equal submission adopt improvements in their language. Such of the natives as were admitted to the sacerdotal function must have learned the Greek language, in order to qualify them for performing the offices of their religion; and a predilection for that language would be the immediate consequence. Hence the natives, who had been admitted into holy orders, would co-operate with their Grecian masters in improving the dialect of the country, which, prior to the period above mentioned, must have greatly deviated from the original standard of the Sarmatian language.

Upon this occasion the Grecian apostles, in conjunction with their Russian disciples, probably reduced the language of the country to a resemblance with the idiom of the Greek. They retained the radical terms as they found them, but by a variety of flections, conjugations, derivations, compositions, and other modifications, transformed them into the Grecian air and apparel. They must have begun with the offices of the church; and amongst a nation of newly converted savages, the language of the religion they had been induced to adopt, would quickly obtain a very extensive circulation. When the Grecian garniture was introduced into the church, the laity would in process of time assume a similar dress. The fabric of the Greek declensions, conjugations, and inflections, might be grafted upon Russian stocks without affecting the radical parts of the language. If the dialect in question, like most others of a very ancient date, laboured under a penury of words, such a device would contribute exceedingly to supply that defect. By this expedient the Greek language itself had been enlarged from about three hundred radical terms to the prodigious number of words of which it now consists.

The Latin language, in its original constitution, differed widely from the Greek; but notwithstanding this incongruity, the improvers of the former have pressed it into a very strict agreement with the latter. This, we think, was a still more difficult task, because the genius of the Latin differs in a much greater degree than that of the Russian does from the genius of the Greek. We know that the Gothic language and all its descendants are, in their essential character, much more in unison with the Greek than they are with the Latin. The Spanish, Italian, and French, have cudgelled many of their Gothic, Teutonic, and Celtic verbs, into a kind of conjugations, imitating or rather aping those of the Latin. The Persians have also formed most elegant and energetic dcelensions and conjugations, upon inflexible roots borrowed from the Pahlavi and Deree, and even from Tartarian originals.

Upon the grounds above mentioned we now take the liberty to hazard the following conjectures, which we cheerfully submit to the cognizance of more enlightened philologists, viz. 1. That the Sarmatian was a dialect of the original language of mankind; 2. That the Sclavonian was a dialect of the Sarmatian; 3. That the Russian is the most genuine and unsophisticated relict of the Sclavonian and Sarmatian; 4. That the Russians had no alphabetical characters prior to the era of the introduction of Christianity, that is, towards the end of the tenth century; 5. That they were converted by Grecian missionaries; 6. That these missionaries[7:17:422] formed their present letters from those of Greece, and, in conjunction with the more enlightened natives, reduced the original and unimproved Russian to its present resemblance to the Grecian standard.

The Russian language, like most others, contains eight parts of speech. Its nouns have three genders, masculine, feminine, and neuter; and it has also a common gender for nouns, intimating both sexes. It has only two numbers, singular and plural. Its cases are seven, nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, instrumental, and prepositive. These cases, however, are not formed by varying the termination, as in Greek and Latin, but generally by placing a vowel after the word, as, we imagine, was the original practice of the Greeks. Thus in Russian, pυκ, ruk, the hand; nominative, pυκ-α, the hand; genitive, pυκ-N'of the hand.^[32. See Charpentier, Eléments de la Langue Russe. ] Nouns substantive are reduced to four declensions, but adjectives constitute a fifth. The latter agree with their substantives in case, gender, and number; and they have three degrees of comparison, as is common in other languages, viz. the positive, comparative, and superlative. The comparative is formed from the feminine of the nominative singular of the positive, by changing a into te, that is, aie in English; and the superlative is formed by prefixing πpe, pre, before the positive. These rules are general; with regard to the exceptions, recourse must be had to a Russian grammar.

The numeral adjectives in Russian have like the rest three genders, and they are declined accordingly. Their pronouns have nothing peculiar, being divided and arranged in the same manner as in other languages. Verbs in the Russian language are comprehended under two conjugations. . The moods are only three; the indicative, the imperative, and the infinitive. The subjunctive is formed by placing a particle before the indicative, and its tenses are eightin number; the present, the imperfect, the preterite simple, the preterite compound, the pluperfect, the future indeterminate, the future simple, the future compound. The verbs have their numbers and persons as in other languages. To enter into a detail of the manner of conjugating Russian verbs would neither be consistent with our plan, nor of much consequence to our readers. The remaining parts of speech differ in nothing from those of other languages. The syntax of Russian nearly resembles thatoftheGreekand Latin. But all these accidents must be learned from a grammar of the language. We could have wished to be able to gratify our readers with a more authentic account of the origin of the Sclavonic language; but this we find impossible, owing to the want of materials relating to the state of the ancient Sarmatae. Towards the era of the subversion of the western empire, the nations who inhabited the countries in question were so blended and confounded with each other, and with Huns and other Scythian or Tartar tribes, that the most acute antiquarian would find it impossible to investigate their respective dialects, or even to fix their original residence and extraction.

We have selected the Russian as the most genuine branch of the old Sclavonic, and to this preference we were determined by the reasons above mentioned. We are not sufficiently acquainted with the idiom of the Russian language to be able to compare it with those of the East; but were such a comparison made we are persuaded that the radical materials of which it is composed would be found to have been of oriental origin. The word Tsar, for example, is probably the Phoenician and Chaldean Sar, or Zar, a prince, or grandee. Diodorus Siculus calls the queen of the Massagetae, who, according to Ctesias, cut off the head of Cyrus, Zarina; which still continues to be the national title of the empress of all the Russias. Herodotus calls the same princess Tomyris, which is the very name of the celebrated Timur or Tamerlane the conqueror of Asia. The former seems to have been the title, and the latter the proper name, of the queen of the Massagetae. In the old Persian or Pahlavi, the word gard signifies a city. In Russian, gorod or grad intimates the very same idea; andhencc Constantinople in old Russian iscalled Tsargrad or Tsargorod. These are only a few specimens; but skilful etymologists might, we believe, discover a great number more.

The Sclavonian language is spoken in Epirus, in the western part of Macedonia, in Bosnia, Servia, Bulgaria, in part of Thrace, in Dalmatia, and Croatia, in Poland, Bohemia, Russia, and Mingrelia, and hence it is frequently used in the seraglio at Constantinople. Many of the great men of Turkey understand it, and frequently use it; and all the janizaries who had been stationed in garrisons on the Turkish frontiers in Europe, formerly used it in their ordinary intercourse. The Hungarians, however, and the natives of Wallachia, speak a different language, one which bears evident marks of Tartarian origin, in short a dialect of that language which was spoken by the original Huns. Upon the whole, the Sclavonic is one of the most widely spread languages in Europe, and even extends far into Asia.

SECT. X. MODERN LANGUAGES.

If the different dialects of the various nations which now inhabit the earth, be called languages, the number will be truly great; and vain would be the ambition of that man who should attempt to acquire them, however imperfectly. But there are four, which maybe considered as original or motherlanguages, and which seem to have given birth to all that are now spoken in Europe. These are the Latin, the Celtic, the Gothic, and the Sclavonic. Let it not, however, be imagined, from the term original applied to these languages, that we believe them to have come down to us, without any alteration. We have repeatedly declared our opinion, that there is but one truly original language, from which all others are derivatives variously modified. The four languages just mentioned are original only as being the immediate parents of those which are now spoken in Europe.

Thus, from the Latin came, the Portuguese, the Spanish, the French, and the Italian. From the Celtic came, the Erse or Gaelic of the Highlands of Scotland, the Welsh, the Irish, and the Basse Bretagne. From the Gothic came, the German, the Low Saxon or Low German, the Dutch, the English, in which almost all the noun-substantives are German, and many of the verbs French or Latin, and which is enriched .with the spoils of all other languages, including the Danish, the Norwegian, Swedish, Icelandic.

From the Sclavonian came, the Polish, the Lithuanian or Lettish, the Bohemian, Transylvanian, Moravian, and the modern Vandalian,as it is still spoken in Lusatia and other parts; the Croatian, the Russian or Muscovite, which, as we have seen, is the purest dialect of this language; the language of the Calmucks and Cossacks; with thirty-two different dialects of nations who inhabit the north-eastern parts of Europe and Asia, and who are descended from the Tartars and Hunno-Scythians. There are polyglott tables containing not only the alphabets, but also the principal or distinctive characteristics of all these languages.

The languages which are at present spoken generally in Asia are, the Turkish and Tartarian, with their different dialects; the Persian, the Georgian or Iberian, the Albanian or Circassian, the Armenian, the modern Indian, the Formosan, the Hindustanee, the Malabarian, the Warugian, the Tamu-licor Damulic, the modern Arabic, the Tongussian, the Mongolian, the language of the Nigarian or Akar Nigarian, the Grusinic or Grusinian, the Chinese, and the Japanese. Here, however, we have only enumerated those Asiatic languages of which we have some knowledge in Europe, and even alphabets, grammars, or other books capable of giving us some information concerning them. But in those vast regions and the [7:17:423] adjacent islands, there are doubtless other languages and dialects, of which no distinct account has yet been obtained.

The principal languages of Africa are, the modern Egyptian, the language of the kingdom of Fez, the Moroccan, and the jargons of those savage nations who inhabit the central regions of that great continent. The people on the coast of Barbary speak a corrupt dialect of the Arabic. To these may beaddedthe Chilhic language, otherwise called Tamazeght ; the Nigritiaπ, and that of Guinea; the Abyssinian, and the language of the Hottentots and Caffres.

(o. o. o. o.)

The number of languages which distinguish the different native tribes of America, appears to be still more considerable in that continent than in Africa, where, according to the researches of Seetzen and Vater, there are above a hundred and forty. In this respect, America resembles the Caucasus, Italy previous to the conquest of the Romans, and Asia Minor, when that country contained the Cilicians of Semitic origin, the Phrygians of Thracian or Gothic extraction, the Lydians, and the Celts. Many circumstances contributed to produce the amazing variety of American dialects, but the principal undoubtedly was the absence of all communication between the different native tribes, occasioned partly by their own condition of life, and partly by the nature and configuration of the country they inhabited. But when it is asserted that several hundreds of languages are found in a continent the whole population of which is scarcely equal to that of France, it should be kept in view that we regard as different all those languages which bear the same affinity to each other, not as the German and Dutch, or the Italian and Spanish, but as the Danish and the German, the Chaldaic and the Arabic, the Greek and the Latin. It is a great mistake to suppose, as some have done, that these languages are all separate and independent, having no points of relation, analogy, or resemblance. In proportion as we penetrate into the labyrinth of the American idioms, we discover that several are susceptible of being classed by families; whilst a still greater number remain insulated like the Basque amongst the European, and the Japanese amongst Asiatic languages. This separation, however, may be only apparent; for it may be presumed that languages which appear to admit of no ethnographical classification, have some affinity, either with other languages which have for a long time been extinct, or with the idioms of nations which have never yet been visited by travellers. The greater number of the American languages, even such as exhibit the same differences from each other as the languages of Teutonic origin, the Celtic, and the Sclavonian, bear a certain analogy in the whole of their organization or structure; particularly in the complication of their grammatical forms, in the modification of the verb according to the nature of its syntactical construction, and in the number of particles employed additively either as affixes or as suffixes. Such an uniform tendency of idioms betrays, if not a community of origin, at least a great analogy in the intellectual dispositions of the American tribes from the Arctic regions to the Straits of Magelhaens.^[33. The natives of America may be divided into two great classes. To the first belong the Esquimaux of Greenland, Labrador, and Hudson’s Bay, and the inhabitants of Behring’s Straits, Alaska, and Prince William’s Sound. The eastern and western branches of this family are united by close similarity of language, though separated by a distance of eight hundred leagues; and the inhabitants of the north-east of Asia are believed to be of the same stock. The second race is dispersed over the various regions of the continent, from the northern parts to the southern extremity. They are larger in size, more warlike, more taciturn, and also differ considerably from the northern class in the colour of their skin, which, according to Humboldt, has been but slightly affected, in either class, by climate or other external circumstances. ]

Investigations made with scrupulous exactness, by following a method which had not previously been employed in etymological pursuits have proved that there are but few words which are common in the vocabularies of the New and Old World. In eighty-three American languages, examined by Barton and Vater, one hundred and seventy words have been found, the roots of which appear to be the same; and that tLis analogy is not accidental may be inferred from the circumstance that it does not rest merely on imitative harmony, or that conformity in the organs which produces almost a perfect identity in the first sounds articulated by children. Of the hundred and seventy words which are common to the two continents, three-fifths resemble the Mantchoo, the Tongouss, the Mongul, and the Samoyed; and two-fifths resemble the Celtic and Finnish, the Coptic and the Congo languages. These words have been discovered by comparing the whole of the American languages with the whole of those of the Old World; for as yet we are not acquainted with any American idiom, which appears to have an exclusive correspondence with any of the Asiatic, African, or European languages. Much has been said by some learned writers, respecting the pretended poverty of all the American languages, and the extreme imperfection of their numerical system; but, in the absence of well-authenticated facts, all such statements should be received with caution, being rather deductions from a preconceived theory, than theresult of actual investigation. Besides, several idioms which now form the speech of barbarous nations, appear to be the wrecks of languages, once rich, flexible, and belonging to a far more cultivated state of society. Whether the primitive condition of the human race was rude and brutalised, or whether the savage hordes which still exist are descended from nations, whose intellectual faculties, and the languages which reflect them, were equally developed, is a question into which we cannot at present enter. We shall only observe, that the little we know of the history of the Americans, tends to prove that the tribes, whose migrations have been directed from the north to the south, whilst yet dwelling in the arctic regions, employed various idioms, which are now found under the torrid zone; and from this we may by analogy conclude, that the multiplication of languages is a very ancient phenomenon. Perhaps those which we call American belong no more to America than the Magyar or Hungarian, and the Tschoud or Finnish belongs to Europe. It is doubtless true that the comparison between the idioms of the two continents has hitherto led to no important conclusion. But we may nevertheless indulge the hope that this study will become more productive, when a greater number of materials shall have been accumulated to exercise the sagacity of the learned. At present many languages exist in America, and in central and eastern Asia, the mechanism of which is as much unknown to us as that of the Tyrhenian, the Oscan, the Umbrian, and the Sabine.

It was our original intention to conclude this article with some general remarks on the modern languages of Europe, particularly the French, the Italian, the Spanish, and the Portuguese, on the one hand, and on the German and English, on the other. But the length to which it has already extended, and the facility of access to works containing ample information respecting the genius and structure of these languages, render it inexpedient to enter into details which are more or less within the reach of almost every well-informed reader.
