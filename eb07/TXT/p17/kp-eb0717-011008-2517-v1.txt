PASSAROUANG, a small town and fort on the northern shore of the island of Java. It is the capital of a large principality, and is intersected by a large river, over which there is a wooden bridge. It is pleasantly situated, has a healthy climate, and its native population is numerous. The surrounding country is fertile, and produces abundant crops of rice and maize. The roads are good; posts have been established along the coast; and it appears to be in all respects a busy and well-regulated settlement. It is situated in longitude 113. 10. east, and latitude 7. 3. south.
