PISSASPHALTUM, or Asphaltum, Earth-pitch, a fluid, opaque, mineral body, of a thick consistence, strong smell, readily inflammable, but leaving a residuum of grayish ashes after burning. It arises out of the cracks of the rocks in several parts of the island of Sumatra, and some other places in the East Indies, where it is much esteemed in paralytic disorders. There is a remarkable mine of it in the island of Bua.
