PIERIDES, in fabulous history, the daughters of Pierus, a Macedonian prince, who, presuming to dispute with the muses for the prize of poetry, were turned into magpies. The name of Pierides was also given to the muses, from Mount Pieris in Thessaly, which was consecrated to them; or, according to others, from Pieris, a Thessalian poet, who was the first who sacrificed to them.
