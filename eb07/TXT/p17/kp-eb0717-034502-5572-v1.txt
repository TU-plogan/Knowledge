PHILIBEG, called also a kilt, is a sort of short petticoat reaching nearly to the knees, which is worn by the Scotch Highlanders. It is a modern substitute for the lower part of the plaid, being found to be less cumbersome, especially in time of action, when the Highlanders used to tuck the brechtan into their girdle.
