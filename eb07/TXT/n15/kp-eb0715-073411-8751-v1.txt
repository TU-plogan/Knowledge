NARCISSUS, in fabulous history, the son of the river Cephisus, and of Liriope the daughter of Oceanus. He was a youth of great beauty; and Tiresias foretold that he would live until he should see himself. He despised all the nymphs of the country, and made Echo languish till she became a mere sound, by refusing to return her passion; but one day returning weary and fatigued from the chase, he stopped on the bank of a fountain to quench his thirst, and, seeing his own form in the water, became so much in love with the shadowy image, that he languished till he died. The gods, being moved by his fate, changed him into the flower which bears his name.
