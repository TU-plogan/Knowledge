NASEBY, a parish of the county of Northampton, in the hundred of Guilsborough. It is situated in an agricultural part of the county, containing, in 1801, 538 inhabitants; in 1811, 598; in 1821, 697; and in 1831, 707. It is remarkable from the decisive victory obtained near it by Cromwell over the army of Charles I. in 1645, a victory which terminated the civil war of that period.
