NATURAL, in general, is something which relates to or concerns nature.

Natural, in Heraldry, is a term used where animals, fruits, flowers, and the like, are blazoned with the colours they naturally possess, though different from the common colours of heraldry; and this is done to prevent armories being accused of falsity when blazoned with the names of colours unknown in heraldry.

Natural Note, in Music, is used in opposition to flat and sharp notes, which are called artificial notes. Natural is alsoemployed to indicate something coming immediately out of the hands of nature; in which sense it is opposed to factitious or artificial, which signifies something wrought or produced by art.
