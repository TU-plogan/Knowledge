NAISSANT, in Heraldry, is usually applied to any animal issuing out of the midst of some ordinary, and showing only his head, shoulders, fore feet, and legs, with the tip of his tail, the rest of his body being hid in the shield, or some charge upon it. In this it differs from issuant, which denotes a living creature arising out of the bottom of any ordinary or charge.
