NACHELO, or Nakhilo, a sea-port of Persia, in Laristan, defended by a square fort, flanked by four towers. It is situated at the mouth of a river which falls into the Persian Gulf, where the anchorage would be good if it were not exposed to the north-west winds. This place was for a time under the dominion of the Wahabees, during the prevalence of their power. There is a fishery of pearls in the neighbourhood. It is fifty miles south-southwest of Lar.
