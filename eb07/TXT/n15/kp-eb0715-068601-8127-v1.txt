NAFELS, a town of Switzerland, of the canton of Glaris, the capital of the Catholic division of that canton. It stands on the river Linth, in a fruitful and pleasant district. The small river Rautibach, on its fall into the Linth, forms a fine, and at times a most copious cascade. A great victory was gained here by the Swiss in 1388, and it is still yearly celebrated with religious and military ceremonies. The town contains 220 houses, with 1730 inhabitants, who are chiefly employed in agriculture.
