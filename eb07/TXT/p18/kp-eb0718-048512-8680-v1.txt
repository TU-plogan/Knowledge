POST, a word derived from the Latin positus, set or placed. It is used in several different meanings, but all of them referring either immediately or remotely to the primitive sense of position. Thus the word post signifies a stake, or piece of timber set upright; a station, particularly a military station; an office or employment; an operation in bookkeeping; a conveyance for letters or dispatches; a particular mode of travelling.
