PYRRHICA, in Antiquity, a kind of exercise on horseback, or a feigned combat, for the exercise of the cavalry. It was so called from its inventor Pyrrhichus or Pyrrhus of Cydonia, who first taught the Cretans to march in measure and cadence to battle, and to observe the Pyrrhic pace. Others derive the name from Pyrrhus the son of Achilles, who instituted this exercise at the obsequies of his father; but Aristotle says that it was Achilles himself who invented it. The Romans called it ludus Trojanus, the Trojan games; and Aulus Gellius, decursus. It is doubtless this exercise which we see represented on medals by two cavaliers in front running with lances, and the word decursio on the exergue.
