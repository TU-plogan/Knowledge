POLYSEMASIA, from the Greek πoλu and σημασια, a term applied to such intervals and chords in harmony, as produce upon the ear the same effect, although they may differ from each other in notation; for example, b B G ¢ A G; BDFbA, BD ft E ¢ G, &c. Also such chords as, although expressed by the same notes, are yet referrible to different harmonic foundations.
