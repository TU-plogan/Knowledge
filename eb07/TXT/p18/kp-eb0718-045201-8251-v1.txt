PORT, a harbour, river, or haven, formed either by nature or art to receive and shelter shipping from the storms and waves of the open sea.

Artificial ports are those which are either formed by throwing a strong mound or rampart across the harbour’s mouth to some island or rock, or erecting two long barriers, which stretch from the land on each side like arms or the horns of a crescent, and nearly enclose the haven. The former of these are called mole-heads, and the latter piers. Port, is also a name given on some occasions to the larboard or left side of the ship, as in the following instances. Thus, it is said, “the ship heels to port,” that is, stoops or inclines to the larboard-side. “Top the yard to port,” the order to make the larboard extremity of a yard higher than the other. “Port the helm,” the order to put the helm over the larboard-side of the vessel. In all these senses this phrase appears intended to prevent any mistakes happening from the similarity of sounds in the words starboard and larboard, particularly when they relate to the helm, where a misapprehension might be attended with very dangerous consequences.

Ports, the embrasures or openings in the side of a ship of war, wherein the artillery is ranged in battery upon the decks above and below. ’
