PROGRESSION, in general, denotes a regular advancing, or going forwards, in the same course or manner.

Progression, in Mathematics, is either arithmetical or geometrical. Continued arithmetical proportion is, where the terms increase and decrease by equal differences, and is called arithmetical progression. Geometrical progression is when the terms increase or decrease by equal ratios.
