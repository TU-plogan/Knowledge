PORT-JACKSON, a bay and English settlement on the east coast of New Holland. The two heads through which the entrance lies are distant from each other one mile and three quarters; and the heads on each side are high, steep, [7:18:455] perpendicular cliffs, between which ships may run in safety. It may be entered in all winds. Within, the port divides into two branches, the one stretching eighteen miles west, the other seven miles north-west. Both contain numerous creeks, on one of which is situated the town of Sidney, the chief town of Botany Bay. Long, of Castle Point, 151. 11.49-E. Lat.33. 51. 45.S.
