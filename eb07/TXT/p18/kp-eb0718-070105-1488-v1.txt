PSALM, a divine song or hymn, but chiefly appropriated to the Psalms of David, a canonical book of the Old Testament. Most of the psalms have a particular title, signifying either the name of the author, the person who was to set it to music or sing it, the instrument which was to be employed, or the subject and occasion of the canticle. Some have imagined that David was the sole author of the Book of Psalms; but the titles of many of them prove the contrary, as Psalm xcâˆ™, which appears to have been written by Moses. Many of the psalms are inscribed with the names Korah, Jeduthun, and others, from the persons who were to sing them.
