PROPONTIS, or Sea of Marmora, a part of the Mediterranean, dividing Europe from Asia. It has the Hellespont, or Canal of the Dardanelles, to the south-west, whereby it communicates with the Archipelago, and the ancient Bosphorus of Thrace, or Strait of Constantinople, to the north-east, communicating with the Black or Euxine Sea. It has two castles; that on the Asiatic side is on a cape, where formerly stood a temple of Jupiter. The Castle of Europe is on the opposite cape, and had anciently a temple of Serapis.
