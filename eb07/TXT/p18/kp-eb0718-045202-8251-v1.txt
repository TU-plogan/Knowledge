PORTADOWN, a thriving post-town, in the county of Armagh, Ireland, 66 miles from Dublin. It is situated on the Upper Bann, navigable here for vessels of 60 tons burden, and is by it connected with the Newry Canal. It has of late years been much improved, and its appearance is now highly respectable. The principal trade is in the agricultural produce of the surrounding country, which is forwarded to Newry by the canal, whilst the returning barges bring slates, coal, iron, &c. for the inland market. A good number of hands are employed in the linen and cotton trade. The population in 1831, amounted to 1,591âˆ™
