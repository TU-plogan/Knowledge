PLEDGE (plegvus), in common law, a surety or gage, either real or personal, which the plaintiff or demandant is to find for his prosecuting the suit.

To Pledge, in drinking, denotes to warrant, or to be surety to one, that he shall receive no harm whilst he is taking his draught. The phrase is referred by antiquaries to the practice of the Danes heretofore in England, who used frequently to stab or cut the throats of the natives whilst they were drinking.
