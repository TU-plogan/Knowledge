PYRENEAN Mountains, or Pyrenees, are the mountains which divide France from Spain, and are the most celebrated in Europe, excepting the Alps. They reach from the Mediterranean as far as the Atlantic Ocean, and are about 212 miles in length. They have different names, according to the different places where they stand. Mont Perdu, the highest of the Pyrenees, has an elevation of 11,283 English feet.
