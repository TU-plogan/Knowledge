POLYPLECTRON, from the Greek πoλυ, much, and πλ5jr.rga ’, a musical instrument invented by Dietz about ten years ago, and played upon in the manner of a piano-forte. Its sounds are produced by the friction of numerous narrow slips of leather made to revolve upon a cylinder and over pullies, and brought into contact with the strings by pressing down the finger-keys. The powers of this instrument were highly commended by Prony, Savart, Cherubini, Paer, and others, after they had made trial of it on the 11th of July 1828. According to the touch, firm and legato, or light and staccato, the quality of the tone varied. The lower sounds and medium ones closely resembled those of the double bass, violoncello, and viola. Dietz had not succeeded in imitating the sounds of a violin. The orchestrinο of Poulleau, and some other instruments on the same principle, preceded Dietz’s polyplcctron.
