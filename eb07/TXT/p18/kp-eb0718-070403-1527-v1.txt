PULLICAT, a town of Hindustan, on the sea-coast of the Carnatic, situated on the borders of a salt-water lake, thirty-three miles in length by eleven in breadth, containing several islands, and communicating with the sea. This lake owes its existence to the sea breaking through a low sandy beach, and overflowing the lands within. The Dutch first settled here in 1609, which, after the loss of Negapatam, became the seat of their government on the Coromandel coast. The inhabitants are principally manufacturers and fishermen, who manufactured the handkerchiefs that took their name from this town. In 1795, when war commenced between Great Britain and Holland, the East India Companyâ€™s troops took possession of this place, which is now comprehended in the northern division of the Arcot collectorship. It is twenty-five miles north of Madras. Long. 80. 25. E. Lat. 13. 26. N.
