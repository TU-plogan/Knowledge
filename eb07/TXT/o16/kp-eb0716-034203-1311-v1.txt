ONYCOMANCY, or, as some persons write it, Ony-mancy, a kind of divination by means of the nails of the fingers. 1he word is formed from the Greek oιvξ, a nail, and μαντεια, divination. The ancient practice was to rub the nails of a youth with oil and soot, or wax, and to hold up the nails thus smeared against the sun, when certain figures or characters, showing the thing required, were supposed to appear upon them.
