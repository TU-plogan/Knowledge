OHETEROA, an island about twelve miles in circumference, in the South Pacific Ocean, without either harbour or anchorage, and only a foul and rocky bay on the west coast. The inhabitants are active, well made, and of a dark complexion. They form circles round their arms and legs, but have no figures on the other parts of their body. Their clothing is made of the bark of a tree, and is curiously coloured; and some of them wear bonnets, adorned with feathers, whilst others wear white stuff in the form of a turban. Their arms are lances made of very hard wood, and long pikes. This island was first discovered by Captain Cook in the year 1769. It is well inhabited, though it is not twenty miles in circumference. It has not, like the Society Islands, any coral reef surrounding it. Long. 150. 47. W. Lat. 22. 27. S.
