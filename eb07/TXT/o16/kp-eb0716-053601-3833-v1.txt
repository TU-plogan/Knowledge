ORIGENIANS (Origeniam) were ancientheretics. Epi-phanus speaks of them as existing in his time; but their numbers, he says, were inconsiderable. He seems to fix their rise about the time of the great Origen; but he does not say that they derived their name from that distinguished father of the church. On the contrary, he distinguishes them from the Origenists, whom he derives from Origen Adamantius Ï‚ adding, that they first took their name from one Origen, by which he intimates that it was not the great Origen. St Augustin also asserts that their founder was a different person. Their doctrines were infamous. They rejected marriage; they used several apocryphal books, as the acts of St Andrew; and they erideavoured to excuse their open crimes, by saying that the Catholics committed the same in private.
