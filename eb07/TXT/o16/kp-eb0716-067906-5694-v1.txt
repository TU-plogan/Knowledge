OVERTURE, in Music, a piece of instrumental music which precedes an opera, a ballet of action, a cantata, &c. Amongst the finest modern overtures are Mozart’s to “Il Flauto Magico,” and to “Don Giovanni ;” also some of Cherubini’s and Beethoven’s. Some of Rossini’s, Weber’s, and Spohr’s have likewise great merit.
