OCELLUS the Lucanian, an ancient Greek philosopher of the school of Pythagoras, who lived before Plato. His work τrεp του ∏αντος, or the Universe, is the only production of his which has come down entire to us; it was written originally in the Doric dialect, but has been translated by another hand into the Attic. William Christian, and after him Louis Nogarola, translated this work into Latin; and there are several editions of it, both in Greek and in Latin.
