OZOLAe, or Ozoli, a people who inhabited the eastern part of Aetolia, called Ozolea. This tract of territory lay at the northern extremity of the bay of Corinth, and extended about twelve miles. The name Ozolae, on account of its indelicate signification, was highly disagreeable to the inhabitants; and they therefore exchanged it for that of Aetolians.
