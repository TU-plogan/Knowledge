ORGANIST, a person who plays upon the organ. In Germany and Prussia, the requisites of a good organist are so many in point of musical education, and musical taste, and mechanical skill, that hardly any of the organists of other countries would venture to enter into competition with the German or Prussian organists. All the best works upon the art of organ-playing are in the German language. We may cite, as one of these, Rinkâ€™s work upon organ-playing.
