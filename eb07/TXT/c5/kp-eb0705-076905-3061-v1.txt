CADIZADELITES, a sect of MahommeÄ‘ans very like the ancient Stoics. They shun feasts and diversions, and affect an extraordinary gravity in all their actions; they [7:5:770] are continually talking of God, and some of them make a jumble of Christianity and Mahommedanism. They drink wine, even in the fast of the Ramazan; they love and protect the Christians; they believe that Mahommed is the Holy Ghost; they practise circumcision, and justify it by the example of Jesus Christ.
