CALAMINE, the native carbonate and silicate of zinc, which, though very generally found in the same deposits, differ materially both in their mineralogical and chemical characters. The most prevalent colour of Calamine is white; occasionally, however, it is blue, green, yellow, or brown. It varies also from transparent to opake; has a vitreous lustre; and occurs both crystallized, stalactitic, mamillatcÄ‘, and massive. It is frequently found in veins, associated with blende, and ores of iron and lead. Considerable quantities occur at Bleibcrg and Raibel in Carinthia, Tarnowitz in Silesia, Altenberg near Aix-la-Chapelle, in the Mendip-hills of Somersetshire, at Wanlockhead in Dumfriesshire, and at Alston Moor in Cumberland. It is a very useful ore of zinc, containing generally from sixty to seventy per cent, of that metal. For further particulars see Mineralogy.
