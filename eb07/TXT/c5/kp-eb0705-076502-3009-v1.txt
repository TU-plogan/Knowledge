CABECA, or Cabess, a name given to the finest silks in the East Indies, while those from fifteen to twenty per cent, inferior to them are called barina. The Indian workmen endeavour to pass them off one with the other; for which reason the more experienced European merchants take care to open the bales, and to examine all the skaines one after another. The Dutch distinguish two sorts of cabe-ças, namely, the moor cabeça and the common cabeça.
