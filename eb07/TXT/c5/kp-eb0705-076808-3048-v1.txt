CADARI, or Kadari, a sect of Mahommedans, who assert free will, attribute the actions of men to men alone, not to any secret power determining the will, and deny all absolute decrees, and predestination. The author of this sect was Mabeb ben Kaled al Gihoni, who suffered martyrdom for his doctrine. The word comes from the Arabic, cadara, power. Ben Aun calls the Cadarians the Magi or Manichees of the Moslemins.
