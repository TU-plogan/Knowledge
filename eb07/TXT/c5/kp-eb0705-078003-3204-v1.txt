CAISTOR, a market-town in the hundred of Yarborough and county of Lincoln. It is joined by a canal to the town of GÅ‚anford Brigg. It is a place of great antiquity, said to have been built by the Saxon Hengist. The town is supplied with water by four springs, whose streams, after passing through it, unite and form the river Ancolm. It is 157 miles from London. The market is held on Monday. The inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 1051, in 1821 to 1253, and in 1831 to 1525.
