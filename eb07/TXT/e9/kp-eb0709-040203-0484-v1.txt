EUPHORBUS, a famous Trojan, son of Panth√∂us. He was the first who wounded Patroclus, whom Hector killed; but he perished by the hand of Menelaus, who hung his shield in the temple of Juno at Argos. Pythagoras, the founder of the doctrine of the metempsychosis, or transmigration of souls, affirmed that he had once been Euphorbus, and that his soul recollected many exploits which had been done whilst it animated the body of that redoubted Trojan. As a further proof of his assertion, he showed at first sight the shield of Euphorbus in the temple of Juno.
