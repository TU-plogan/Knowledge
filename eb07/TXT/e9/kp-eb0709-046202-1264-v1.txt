EXCRESCENCE, in Surgery, denotes every preternatural tumour which arises upon the skin, either in the form of a wart or a tubercle. If such tumours are born with a person, as is frequently the case, they are called naevi materni, or marks from the mother; but if they are large, so as to depend from the skin, like a fleshy mass, they are then called sarcomata.
