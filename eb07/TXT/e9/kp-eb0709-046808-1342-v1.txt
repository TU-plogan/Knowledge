EXPRESSION, in Rhetoric, the elocution, diction, or choice of words in a discourse.

Expression, in Painting, a natural and lively representation of the subject, or of the several objects intended to be shown. The expression consists chiefly in representing the human body and all its parts in the action suitable to it; in exhibiting the several passions proper to the figures; and in observing the motions they impress on the external parts.
