EXHIBITION, in Law, a producing or showing of titles, authorities, and other proofs, in a matter contested.

Exhibition, in our old writers, is used to signify an allowance of meat and drink, such as was customary amongst the religious appropriators of churches, who usually made it to the vicar incumbent. The benefactions settled for the maintaining of scholars in the universities not depending on the foundation, are also called exhibitions.
