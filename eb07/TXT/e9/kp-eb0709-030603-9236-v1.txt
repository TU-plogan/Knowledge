EPHYDOR, in Antiquity, an officer in the Athenian courts of justice, whose business it was to provide the plaintiff and defendant with equal water hour-glasses. When the glass had run out, they were not permitted to speak any longer; and therefore we find them very careful not to lose or mis-spend one drop of the water. Whilst the laws quoted by them were reciting, or if any other business happened to intervene, they gave orders that the glass should be stopped.
