EXPERIMENTUM Crucis, a capital, leading, or decisive experiment, which is so termed, either on account of its being like a cross, or direction-post placed in the meeting of several roads, guiding men to the true knowledge of the nature of that thing they are inquiring after; or on account of its being a kind of torture, by means of which the nature of the thing is as it were extorted by force.
