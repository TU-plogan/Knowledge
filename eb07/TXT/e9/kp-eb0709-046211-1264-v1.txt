EXEDRAe, in Antiquity, denoted halls with many seats, where the philosophers, rhetoricians, and men of learning met for discourse and disputation. The word occurs m [7:9:463] ecclesiastical writers as a general name for such buildings as were distinct from the main body of the churches, and yet within the limits of the church taken in its largest sense. Among the exedrae the chief was the baptistery.
