EQUESTRIAN (equestris), a term chiefly used in the [7:9:352] phrase equestrian statue, which signifies a statue representing a person mounted on horseback. The word is formed from the Latin eques, knight or horseman, from eqÎ·us, horse.

Equestrian Games, among the Romans, horse-races, of which there were five kinds; the prodromus or plain horse-race, the chariot-race, the decursory-race about funeral piles, the ludi sevirales, and the ludi neptunales.
