EPITRITUS, in Prosody, a foot consisting of three long syllables and one short. Of these, grammarians reckon four kinds; the first consisting of an iambus and spondee, as sălūtāntēs ; the second, of a trocheus and spondee, as concitātĩ ; the third of a spondee and an iambus, as commumcãns ; and the fourth of a spondee and trocheus, as ĩncãntãre. See the articles Spondeus, Trocheus, and Iambus.
