ERMIN, in Heraldry, denotes a white field or fur, powdered or interspersed with black spots, called powdering. Ermin, an order of knights instituted in 1450, by Francis I. duke of Bretagne, and which formerly subsisted in France. The collar of this order was of gold, composed of ears of corn in saltier, at the end of which hung the ermine, with the inscription a ma vie. But the order expired when the dukedom of Bretagne was annexed to the crown of France.
