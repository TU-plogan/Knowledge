EVIDENCE, in Philosophy, that perception of truth which arises either from the testimony of the senses or from an induction of reason.

Evidence, in Law, signifies some proof by testimony of men upon oath, or by writings or records. See England, Part HI. Government and Laws. Evil, in Philosophy, is either moral or natural. Moral evil is the disagreement between the actions of a moral agent and the rule of those actions, whatever it is. Natural evil is whatever destroys or any way disturbs the perfection of natural beings, such as blindness, disease, and death.

Kings EÎ½iL, or Scrofula. See Medicine.
