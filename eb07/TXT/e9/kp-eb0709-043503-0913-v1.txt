EX, or Exe, a river of England, which rises in a barren tract of land called Exmoor, in the county of Somerset, and after being enlarged by several accessions, passes Tiverton, Exeter, and Topsham. It next receives the waters of the Kew, and falls into the sea at Exmouth. This river is navigable by vessels of considerable burden to Topsham, and was so to Exeter formerly.
