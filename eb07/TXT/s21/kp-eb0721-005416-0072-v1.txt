SYNOECIA, in Grecian antiquity, a feast celebrated at Athens in memory of Theseusâ€™s having united all the petty communities of Attica into one single commonwealth, the seat of which was at Athens, where all the assemblies were to be held. This feast was dedicated to Minerva; and, according to the scholiast on Thucydides, it was held in the month Metagition.
