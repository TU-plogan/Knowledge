JAPYDES, or Iapodes, a people who stretched along the coast of the Adriatic, from the Gulf of Quarnero, as far as Zara, the ancient Jadera, for a distance of 1000 stadia. They occupied the valleys of Mons Albius, which form the extreme point of the Alps to the east, extending in the interior to the Pannonii and the Ister or Danube. They were finally subdued by Augustus after they had twice defeated the Romans within twenty years, attacked Aquileia, and plundered Tergestum or Trieste. Their towns were Metulum, Arupenum, Monettium, and Veudum. They were in the habit of tatooing their bodies. (Strab. vii. 315; Appian. Illyr. 18, 19.)
