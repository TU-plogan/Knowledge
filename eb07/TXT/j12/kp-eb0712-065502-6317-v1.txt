JUSTIFICATION, in Law, signifies a maintaining or showing a sufficient reason in court why the defendant did what he is called to answer.

Justification, in Theology, that act of grace which renders a man just in the sight of God, and worthy of eternal happiness.
[7:12:656]

Different sects of Christians hold very different opinions concerning the doctrine of justification; some contending for justification by faith alone, and others for justification by good works.
