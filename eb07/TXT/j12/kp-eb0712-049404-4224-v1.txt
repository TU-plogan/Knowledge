JAFNAPATAM is the name of a district in the northern extremity of Ceylon. It is considered as the most healthy and populous part of the island, as it escapes, owing to its maritime situation, the intensely hot winds which prevail on the continent. It is clear of woods, produces a variety of fruit and vegetables, and abounds also in poultry and game; whilst the tract that lies between Point Pedro and Jafna is favourable to the breeding of sheep. In the islands dependent on this district, namely, Delft, Harlem, Leyden, and Amsterdam, so named by the Dutch from their native cities, government has an establishment for breeding horses and cattle, for which the islands afford excellent pasture. The woods towards the interior, separating the district from the Candian provinces, are inhabited by a savage race of people known by the name of the Vadahs or BeÄ‘ahs, who are supposed to be the ancient inhabitants of the country.
