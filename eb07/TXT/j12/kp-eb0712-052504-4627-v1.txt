JARCHI, Solomon, otherwise Isaahi Solomon, a famous rabbi, born at Troyes, in Champagne, who flourished in the twelfth century. He was a perfect master of the Talmud and Gemara; and he filled the postils of the Bible with so many Talmudical reveries, as totally extinguished both the literal and the moral sense of it. The greater part of his commentaries are printed in Hebrew, and some have been translated into Latin by the Christians. They are generally esteemed by the Jews, who have bestowed on the author the title of prince of commentators.
