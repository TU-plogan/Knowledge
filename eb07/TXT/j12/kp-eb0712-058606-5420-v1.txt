JOAB, general of the army of King David, who defeated the Syrians and the other enemies of David, and took from the Jebusites the fort of Zion, considered by them as impregnable. He also signalized himself in all David’s wars, but was guilty of basely murdering Abner and Amasa. He procured a reconciliation between Absalom and David; and afterwards slew Absalom, contrary to the express orders of the king· He at length joined Adonijah’s party, and was put to death by the order of Solomon, in the yean before Christ 1014.
[7:12:587]
