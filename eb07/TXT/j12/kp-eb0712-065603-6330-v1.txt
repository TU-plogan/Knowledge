JUSTINIANI, St Laurence, the first patriarch of Venice, descended of a noble family, was born there in the year 1381. He died in 1485, leaving several religious works, which were printed together at Lyons in 1568, in one volume folio, with his life prefixed by his nephew. He was beatified by Clement VII. in 1524, and canonized by Alexander VIII. in 1690.

Justiniani, Augustin, bishop of Nebbio, one of the most learned men of his time, was descended from a branch of the same noble family with the preceding, and born at Genoa in 1480. He assisted at the fifth council of Lateran, where he opposed some articles of the concordat between France and the court of Rome. Francis I. made him his almoner; and he was for five years rcgius professor of Hebrew at Paris. He returned to Genoa in 1522, where he discharged all the duties of a good prelate; whilst learning and piety flourished in his diocese. He perished at sea in his passage from Genoa to Nebbio, in 1536. He composed several pieces, the most considerable of which is Psalterium Hebroewm, Gr cecum, Arabicum, et Chaldaicum, cum tribus Latinis interpretationibus et glossis. This was the first psalter of the kind printed. There is also ascribed to this prelate a translation of Maimonidesâ€™s More Nevochim.
