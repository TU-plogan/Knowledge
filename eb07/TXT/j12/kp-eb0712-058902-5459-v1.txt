JOHANNISBERG, a town of the duchy of Nassau, in Germany, near the Rhine, containing about 700 inhabitants. It is celebrated for its wine. The most famous of the vineyards belonged formerly to the prince-bishop of Fulda, but now to Prince Metternich, who has a castle at the town, and is said to derive from his wine an income of L.4000 per annum. There is much other wine produced from the neighbourhood, of an excellent quality; but it is estimated lower than that of the prince.
