JESSELMERE, a large district of Hindustan, in the province of Ajmeer, situated about the twenty-eighth degree of north latitude, and extending to the sandy desert, which constitutes the western boundary of that province. It is a barren country, being for the most part an uninterrupted tract of sand, without rivers, and the wells being of very great depth under ground. Its complete sterility is, however, in some degree owing to the government, as the whole tract is within the limits of the periodical rains, and, if duly cultivated, would be productive. But it is an almost constant scene of hostility, from the number of petty chiefs among whom it is divided. The original inhabitants, in whose possession it still remains, are of the Hindu Brahminical religion, but few in number. The capital is of the same name, and is governed by an independent chief. Long. 72. 16. E. Lat. 27. 44. N.
