JIB, the foremost sail of a ship, being a large stay-sail, extended from the outer end of the boltsprit, and prolonged by the jib-boom, towards the fore-top mast head. See Sail. Jin-Loom, a boom run out from the extremity of the boltsprit, parallel to its length, and serving to extend the bottom of the jib, and the stay of the foretop-gallant mast. This boom, which is nothing more than a continuation of the boltsprit forward, to which it may be considered as a top-mast, is usually attached to the boltsprit by means of two large boom-irons, or by one boom-iron, and a cap on the outer end of the boltsprit; or, finally, by the cap without and a strong lashing within, instead of a boom-iron, which is generally the method of securing it in small merchant ships.
