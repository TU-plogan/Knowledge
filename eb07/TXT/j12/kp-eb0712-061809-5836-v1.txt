Jonathan, or Jonas, Maccabaeus, brother of Judas, a renowned general of the Jews. He forced Bacchides, the Syrian general, who made war with the Jews, to accept a peace, conquered Demetrius Soter, and afterwards defeated Apollonius, general of that prince; but, being ensnared by Tryphon, he was put to death, 144 before Christ.
