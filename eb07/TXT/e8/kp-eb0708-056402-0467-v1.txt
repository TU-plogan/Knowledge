ELCESAITES, in Ecclesiastical History, were ancient heretics, who made their appearance in the reign of the Emperor Trajan, and took their name from their leader Elcesai. The Elcesaites observed a mean between the Jews, Christians, and Pagans. They worshipped but one God, observed the Jewish sabbath, and practised circumcision and the other ceremonies of the law. They rejected the Pentateuch and the prophets; nor had they any more respect for the writings of the apostles, particularly those of St Paul.
