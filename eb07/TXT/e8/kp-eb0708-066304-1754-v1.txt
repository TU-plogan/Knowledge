ELECTUARY, in Pharmacy, a form of medicine composed of powders and other ingredients, incorporated with some conserve, honey, or syrup, and divided into doses, like boluses.

Vossius observes, that all the remedies prescribed for the sick, as well as the confections taken by way of regale, were called by the Greeks εκλs∕yμαrα, from the verb λs∕χω, I lick ; whence, he thinks, was formed the Latin electarium, and afterwards electuarium. This conjecture he supports from the laws of Sicily, where it is ordained that electuaries, syrups, and other remedies, shall be prepared after the legal manner. The Bollandists, who relate this etymology, seem to confirm it.
