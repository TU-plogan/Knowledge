ENALLAGE, in Grammar, is when one word is substituted for another of the same part of speech: a substantive for an adjective; as exercitus victor, for victoriosus ; scelus, for scelestus ; a primitive for a derivative; as Dardana arma, for Dardania : an active for a passive; as nox humida coelo précipitât, for prcecipitatur ; and so on.
