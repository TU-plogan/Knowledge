ENGINE, in Mechanics, is a compound machine, including one or more mechanical powers, as levers, pulleys, screws, and the like, made in order to raise, cast, or sustain any weight, or produce any effect which could not be easily effected otherwise. The word is formed, through the medium of the French, from the Latin ingenium, by reason of the ingenuity required in the contrivance of engines to augment the effect of moving powers.
