EJECTMENT, in English Law, a writ or action which lies in favour of the lessee for years, on his being ejected or put out of his land before the expiration of his term, either by the lessor or a stranger. It may also be brought by the lessor against the lessee, for rent in arrears, or holding over his term, and the like.
