FULNEK, a town of the circle of Prerau, in the Austrian province of Moravia. It contains 400 houses, and 3045 inhabitants, among whom are many cloth manufacturers. This was the original spot whence issued the respectable Protestant sect of the United Brethren, known in Germany by the name of Hernhutters or Zin-gendorfers, and in England called Moravians. The establishment in Yorkshire of this sect is called by the name of the place of its origin.
