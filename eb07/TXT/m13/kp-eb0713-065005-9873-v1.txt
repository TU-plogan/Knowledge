It is a neat, well-built town, and very ancient, being the place where Owen Glendower assembled his parliament, and exercised other acts of regality, in the year 1402. The market is held on Monday. It is an ancient borough, and, in conjunction with Llanidloes, Llanvilling, Welshpool, and Newton, returns one member to parliament. The population amounted in 1801 to 1118, in 1811 to 1252, in 1821 to 1595, and in 1831 to 1625.
