MAFRA, a small town in Portugal, the principal cele brity of which is derived from a royal convent, one of the most splendid in the kingdom. The convent contains three hundred cells, for as many monks. The church, which is in the centre, is large and handsome; and the marble steps leading to it are peculiarly grand. The interior is ornamented with beautiful marbles, exquisitely wrought. There are in it six organs and twelve altars. The whole pile is enormous, being two hundred and sixty feet in length, containing eight hundred and seventy apartments, and five thousand two hundred windows. Near the convent is an extensive and beautiful royal park, well stocked with game of every kind. It is in the province of Estremadura, and contains 1000 inhabitants.
