MAGI, or Magicians, an ancient religious sect in Persia, and other countries, who maintained that there were two principles, one the cause of all good, the other the cause of all evil; and, abominating the adoration of images, they worshipped God only by fire, which they looked upon as the brightest and most glorious symbol of Oromasdes or the good god, as darkness is the truest symbol of Ahriman or the evil god. This religion was reformed by Zoroaster, who maintained that there was one supreme independent Being, and under him two principles or angels, one the angel of goodness and light, and the other the angel of evil and darkness; that there is a perpetual struggle between them, which shall last to the end of the world; that then the angel of darkness and his disciples shall go into a world of their own, where they shall be punished in everlasting night; and that the angel of light and his disciples shall also go into a world of their own, where they shall be rewarded in everlasting day. The priests of the Magi were the most skilful mathematicians and philosophers of the ages in which they lived, insomuch that a learned man and a magician became equivalent terms. The vulgar looked on their knowledge as supernatural; and hence those who practised wicked and mischievous arts, taking upon themselves the name of magicians, drew on it that ill signification which the word now bears amongst civilised nations.
