MACHUL, a musical instrument amongst the Hebrews. Kircher apprehends that this name was given to two kinds of instruments, one of the stringed, and the other of the pulsatile kind. That of the former sort had six chords; but there is great reason to doubt whether an instrument requiring the aid of the hair-bow, and so much resembling the violin, be as ancient as this would imply. The second kind was of a circular form, made of metal, and either hung round with little bells, or furnished with iron rings suspended on a rod or bar which passed across the circle. Kircher supposes that it was moved to and fro by a handle fixed to it, and thus emitted a melancholy kind of murmur.
