MACEDONIANS, in Ecclesiastical History, the followers of Macedonius, bishop of Constantinople, who, through the influence of the Eunomians, was deposed by the council of Constantinople in 360, and sent into exile. He considered the Holy Ghost as a divine energy diffused throughout the universe, and not as a person distinct from the Father and the Son. The sect of Macedonians was crushed before it had arrived at its full maturity, by the council at Constantinople, in the year 381.
