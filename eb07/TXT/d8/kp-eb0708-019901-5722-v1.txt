DRIVING, in Metallurgy, is said of silver, when, in the operation of refining, the lead being burnt away, the remaining copper rises upon its surface in red fiery bubbles.

Driving, in the sea language, is said of a ship when an anchor being let fall does not hold her fast, nor prevent her sailing away with the wind or tide. The best help in this case is to let fall more anchors, or to veer out more cable; for the more cable she has out, the safer she rides. When a ship is a-hull or a-try, they say she drives to leeward.
