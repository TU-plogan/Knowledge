DICTYS Cretensis, a very ancient historian, who served under Idomeneus, king of Crete, in the Trojan war, and wrote the history of that expedition in nine books. Tzetzes tells us that Homer formed his Iliad upon the plan of that history. It is, however, maintained that the Latin history of Dictys now extant is spurious.
