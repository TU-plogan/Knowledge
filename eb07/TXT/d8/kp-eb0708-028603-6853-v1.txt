DUPONDIUS, in Antiquity, a weight of two pounds, or money of the value of two asses. See As.

Since the as at first weighed a pondo or libra, the dupondius must have weighed two; and hence the name. Though the weight of the as was afterwards diminished, and consequently that of the dupondius, yet they still retained the denomination. See Pound and Libra.
