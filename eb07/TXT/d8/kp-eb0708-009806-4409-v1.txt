DOMAT, or Daumat, John, a celebrated French jurisconsult, born in 1625. Having observed the confused state of the laws, he digested them in four volumes 4to, under the title of Lois Civiles dans leur Ordre Naturel ; an undertaking for which Louis XIV. settled on him a pension of two thousand livres. Domat was intimate with the famous Pascal, who left him his private papers at his death. He himself died in 1696. Besides the Lois Civiles, Domat made in Latin a selection of the most common laws in the collections of Justinian; but this work did not appear until after his death, when it was published separately, under the title of Legum Delectus. Subsequently, however, it was united with the Lois Civiles. Domat may be regarded as the restorer of reason in jurisprudence.
