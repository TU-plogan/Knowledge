DONCASTER, a large town in the wapentake of Strafforth and Tickhill, in the county of York, 158 miles from London. It is a well-built town, and occupies a fine situation[7:8:111] on the river Don, which is thus far navigable. It is celebrated for the wealth of its corporation, the races which are annually held here, and for its magnificent church. These attractions have drawn many residents, who subsist on moderate fortunes. The first power-looms were attempted here near forty years ago. There is some trade by the river, and a large market held on Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 5697, in 1811 to 6935, in 1821 to 8544, and in 1831 to 10,801.
