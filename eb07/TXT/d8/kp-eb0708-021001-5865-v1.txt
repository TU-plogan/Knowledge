DRUM is a martial instrument in the form of a cylinder, hollow within, and covered at the two ends with vellum, which is stretched or slackened at pleasure by means of small cords or sliding knots. It is beat upon with sticks. Drums are sometimes made of brass, but most commonly of wood. The drum is said by Le Clerc to have been an oriental invention, and to have been brought into Spain by the Arabians, or perhaps rather the Moors.

Kettle Drums are two sorts of large basons of copper or brass, rounded in the bottom, and covered with vellum or goat skin, which is kept fast by a circle of iron round the body of the drum, with a number of screws to screw up and down. They are much used among the cavalry, as also in operas, oratorios, concerts, and the like.
