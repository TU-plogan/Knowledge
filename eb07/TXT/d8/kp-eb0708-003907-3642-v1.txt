DIS, an inseparable article prefixed to various words, the effect of which is either to give them a signification contrary to what the simple words have, as disoblige, disobey ; or to signify a separation or detachment, as disposing, distributing.

Dis, a god of the Gauls, the same as Pluto the god of hell. The inhabitants of Gaul supposed themselves descended from that deity.
