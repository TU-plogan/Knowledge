DODWELL, Henry, a very learned controversial writer, of English extraction, born at Dublin in 1641. He wrote an incredible number of tracts, but his services were so little acknowledged, that Bishop Burnet and others accuse him of doing more harm than good to the cause of Christianity, by his indiscreet love of paradoxes and novelties, and thus exposing himself to the scoffs of unbelievers. His pamphlet on the immortality of the soul gave rise to the well-known controversy between Mr Collins and Dr Clarke on that subject. He died in 1711.
