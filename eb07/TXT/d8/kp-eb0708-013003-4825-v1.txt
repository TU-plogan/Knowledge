DOUNE, a village of Scotland, in the southern part of Perthshire, pleasantly situated on the northern bank of the Teith. It consists of three streets radiating from a centre, where stands the market-cross. Its general appearance was much improved in 1826 by the erection of a parish church in the Gothic style, with a handsome tower. In the immediate vicinity is an extensive cotton manufactory.
