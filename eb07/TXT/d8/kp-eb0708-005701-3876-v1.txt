DIU, a celebrated island and fortress of Hindustan, in the province of Gujerat. It is six and a half miles long by one and a half broad, is nearly barren, and contains no good water, excepting what is collected in ponds during the rainy weather. It owes its fame to a noted Hindu temple, which rose to great celebrity, and was reckoned one of the richest places of the East. In the year 1025, Sultan Mahmood of Ghizni having overrun the province, entered the island, which is separated from the main land by a narrow strait only fordable at low water, and having taken the temple, broke the image in pieces, and found in it jewels to an incredible amount, and immense treasures also in the temple. In 1815 the Portuguese gained possession of Diu. They immediately commenced fortifying it, and in ten years rendered it impregnable against all the potvers of India. It soon became a place of great trade and commerce, and was the harbour in which the fleets were laid up in winter. But with the decline of the Portuguese power it fell into decay, and was finally plundered by the Arabs of Muscat in 1670. It has since dwindled into insignificance, and has now little or no commerce. Long. 71. E. Lat. 20. 43. N.
