DURY, Joh N, a Scotch divine, who travelled much, and laboured with great zeal to reunite the Lutherans with the Calvinists. His discouragements in this scheme started another still more impracticable, namely, to reunite all Christians by means of a new explication of the Apocalypse, which he published at Frankfort in 1677. He there enjoyed a comfortable retreat in the country of Hesse; but the time of his death is unknown. His letter to Peter du Moulin, concerning the state of the churches of England, Scotland, and Ireland, was printed at London in 1658, under the superintendence of Du Moulin, and is esteemed curious.
