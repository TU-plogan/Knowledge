DISCRETE or Disjunct Proportion is when the ratio of two or more pairs of numbers or quantities is the ’same, but when there is not the same proportion between all the four numbers. Thus, if the numbers 3 ∙. 6 :: 8: 16 be considered, the ratio between 3: 6 is the same as that between 8: 16, and therefore the numbers are proportional; but it is only discretely or disjunctly, for 3 is not to 6 as 6 to 8; that is, the proportion is broken off between 8 and 3, and is not continued as in the following continual proportionals, 3: 6 :: 12: 24.

Discrete Quantity is such as is not continued and joined together. Sueh, for instance, is any number.
