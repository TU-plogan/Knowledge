DIAPASON, in Music, a musical interval, which most authors who have written on the theory of music use to express the octave of the Greeks.

Diapason, among the musical instrument makers, a kind of rule or scale by which they adjust the pipes of organs, and cut the holes of hautboys, flutes, and the like, in due proportion for performing the tones, semitones, and concords, with precision.

Diapason Diaex, in Music, a kind of compound concord, of which there are two sorts; the greater, which is in the proportion of 10:3; and the lesser, in that of 16:5.

Diapason Diapente, in Music, a compound consonance in a triple ratio, as 3:9. This interval, says Martianus Capella, consists of nine tones and a semitone, nineteen semitones, and thirty-eight dieses. It is a symphony made when the voice proceeds from the first to the twelfth sound.

Diapason Diatessaron, in Music, a compound concord founded on the proportion of eight to three. To this interval Martianus Capella allows eight tones and a semitone, seventeen semitones, and thirty-four dieses. This is when the voice proceeds from its first to its eleventh sound. The moderns would rather call it the eleventh. Diapason Ditone, in Music, a compound concord, whose terms are as 10 :4, or as 5: 2.

Diapason Semiditone, in Music, a compound concord, whose terms are in the proportion of 12 :5.
