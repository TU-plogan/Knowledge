DOCIMENUM Marmor, a name given by the ancients to a species of marble, of a bright and clear white, which was much used in large and sumptuous buildings, such as temples and the like. It derived its name from Do-cimenos, a city of Phrygia, afterwards called Synaia, near which it was quarried, and whence it was eonveyed to Rome. It was accounted little inferior to the Parian in colour, but not eapable of so elegant a polish; and hence it was less used by the statuaries, or in other smaller works. The Emperor Hadrian is said to have used this marble in building the temple of Jupiter; and many of the great works of the Romans are constructed of the same materials.
