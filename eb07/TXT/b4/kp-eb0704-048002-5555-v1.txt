BEAUMONT, Sir John, the elder brother of Mr Francis Beaumont the famous dramatic poet, was born in the year 1582, and in 1626 had the dignity of baronet conferred upon him by King Charles I. In his youth he applied himself to poetry with tolerable success, and wrote The Crown of Thorns, a poem, in eight books; a miscellany, entitled Bosworth Field: Translations from the Latin poets; and several poems on religious and political subjects. He died in 1628. His poetic genius was celebrated by Ben Johnson, Michael Drayton, and others.
