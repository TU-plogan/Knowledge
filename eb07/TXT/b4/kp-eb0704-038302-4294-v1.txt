BARNET, or Chipping Barnet, a market-town in the hundred of Caisho and county of Hertford, 11 miles from London, on the great northern road. Near it, in 1471, was fought the decisive battle between the houses of York and Lancaster, in which the great Earl of Warwick fell. The market, held on Monday, is large, as well as the great cattle fairs. The inhabitants in 1801 amounted to 1258, in 1811 to 1579, and in 1821 to 1755.
