BASILIUS, surnamed the Macedonian, emperor of the Greeks. He was originally a common soldier, and of an obscure family in Macedonia; but having attracted the attention of the emperor Michael by his address in thÂ©- management of horses, he became first equerry, then great chamberlain, and, having assassinated the famous Bardas, was at length associated to the empire in 849. Basilius held the eighth general council at Constantinople deposed the patriarch Photius, but in 858 restored him to the patriarchate; and declared against the popes, who refused to admit him into their communion. He was dreaded by his enemies the Saracens, whom he frequently vanquished, and loved by his subjects on account of his justice and clemency. He died in 886.
