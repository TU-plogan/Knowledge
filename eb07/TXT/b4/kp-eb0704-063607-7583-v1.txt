BIDLOO, Godfrey, author of several treatises on anatomy, was born at Amsterdam on the 12th March 1649. In 1688 he was chosen professor of anatomy at the Hague, and in 1694 at Leyden, when King William III. of England appointed him his physician; an office which he accepted only on condition of holding his professorship, which was readily conceded to him. He published in Latin, 1. The Anatomy of the Human Body, demonstrated in 105 cuts, explained by the discoveries of the ancient and modern writers; 2. An Oration upon the Antiquity of Anatomy; 3. A Letter to Anthony Leeuâˆ™ wenhoeck on the animalcules sometimes found in the liver of sheep and other animals; 4. Two Decades of Dissertations in Anatomy and Chirurgery; and other pieces. He died at Leyden in April 1713.
