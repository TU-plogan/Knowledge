BASTINADO, or Bastinade, the punishment of beating or drubbing a criminal with a stiek. The word is formed from the Freneh baston, a stiek, staff, or eudgel. 1 he bastinade was a punishment used among the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Jews, and still obtains among the l urks. The Romans ealled it fastigatio, fustium admonitio, fustibus ccedi ; whieh differed from the flagellatio in being done with a stiek instead of a rod or seourge. Fustigation was a lighter punishment, and inflicted on freemen; flagellation a severer, and reserved for slaves. It was also called tympanum, because the patient here was beat with sticks like a drum. The punishment of the bastinado is mueh in use in the East at this day; and it is c∣ιiefly administered on the soles of the feet, whieh are sometimes beaten almost to a jelly.
