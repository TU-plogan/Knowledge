BANGOR, a city, the see of a bishop, in the county ot Carnarvon, in North Wales, 253 miles from London, on the magnificent new road to Ireland by Holyhead. A harbour has recently been constructed, at which are loaded numerous vessels with slates, from the extensive quarries in that neighbourhood. The cathedral is very ancient, but neither large nor elegant: it is also used as a parish church. The diocese of Bangor comprehends the whole of Carnarvonshire except three parishes, all Anglesea, and a part of Denbigh, Merioneth, and Montgomery, containing in all 107 parishes. The inhabitants in 1801 amounted to 1790, in 1811 to 2393, and in 1821 to 3579.

Bangor, a town of Ireland, in the county of Down, situated on the south shore of Carrickfergus Bay. Here is a small harbour, and a considerable fishery is carried on for soles, plaise, and turbot, and during the winter for cod and oysters. It is 114 miles N. by E. of Dublin.
