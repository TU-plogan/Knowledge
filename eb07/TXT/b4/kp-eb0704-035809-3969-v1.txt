BARAN, a circle in the Austrian kingdom of Hungary, extending over 1681 square miles, or 1,075,840 acres. It lies at the south-east angle formed by the Danube and the Drave, and comprehends one city, seven towns, and 328 villages, with 223,400 inhabitants. The greater part of the land is fertile, but a portion of it is marshy and unhealthy. The chief products are corn, wine, flax, tobacco, and potash. There are some valuable quarries of marble and millstones, and many mines of fossil coal. It is subdivided into four smaller circles. The capital is Funf-kirchen.
