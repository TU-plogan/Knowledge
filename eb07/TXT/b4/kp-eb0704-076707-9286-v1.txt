BONAVISTA, an island near the western coast of Africa, forming part of the group called Cape de Verd from their vicinity to that remarkable promontory. It was the first of the number discovered by the Portuguese in 1450. Captain Porter describes the island as consisting of a level plain, rising in the centre into rugged and rocky eminences. A great part is capable of cultivation, and might yield in abundance cotton and indigo, were these properly attended to by the indolent natives. There are two good roads for shipping. The northern side, according to Captain Cook, is in long. 22. 59. E. and lat. 16.
