BIRBHOOM, a district of Hindostan, in the province of Bengal, situated about the 24th degree of north latitude, being eighty-five miles in length by thirty in breadth. It is the largest Mahommedan zemindary in Bengal, and is held by a Mahommedan family of the Afghan nation, said to have been fixed there by Shere Shah about the year 1541, for the purpose of defending the frontiers against the barbarous tribes of the mountains. The present inhabitants are chiefly Hindoos. The chief towns are Su-rool, Sooro, and Nagore. In 1801 the population of this district was returned, to the queries of Marquis Wellesley, at 700,000, in the proportion of one Mahommedan to thirty Hindoos.
