BIER, a wooden machine for carrying the bodies of the dead to the place of interment. The word comes from the French bi√®re, which signifies the same thing. It is called in Latin feretrum, from ferendo. Among the Romans the common bier, on which the poorer sort were carried, was called sandapila ; that used for the richer sort lectica, lectica funebris, and sometimes lectus. The former was only a wooden chest, vilis arca, which was burnt with the body; the latter was enriched with gilding and other ornaments. It was carried bare or uncovered when the person died a natural and easy death; when he was much disfigured or distorted it was veiled or covered over.
