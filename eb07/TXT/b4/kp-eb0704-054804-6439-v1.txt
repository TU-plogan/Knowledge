BELLEAU, Remi, a French poet, born at Nogent le Rotrou, in the territory of Perche, and province of Orleannois. He lived in the family of Renatus of Lorraine, marquis of Elbeuf, general of the French galleys, and attended him in his expedition into Italy in 1557. This prince highly esteemed Belleau for his courage; and having also a high opinion of his genius and abilities, intrusted him with the education of his son Charles of Lorraine. Belleau was one of the seven poets of his time who were denominated the French Pleiades. He wrote several pieces, and translated the odes of Anacreon into the French language; but in this he is thought not to have preserved the natural beauties of the original. Belleau died at Paris, in the family of the duke d’Elbeuf, on the 6th of March 1577, and was interred in the church Des Pères Augustines, near the Pont-neuf.
