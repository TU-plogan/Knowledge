BEALE, Mary, distinguished for her skill in painting, was the daughter of Mr Cradock, minister of Walton-upon-Thames, and learned the rudiments of her art from Sir Peter Lely. She painted in oil, in water-colours, and in crayons,and had much business. Her portraits were executed in the Italian style, which she acquired by copying pictures and drawings from Sir Peter Lely’s an∣ the royal collections. Her master, says Mr Walpole, was supposed to have had a tender attachment to her, but as he was reserved in communicating to her all the resources of his pencil, it was probably a gallant rather than a successful one. Mrs Beale died in Pall Mall on the 28th of December 1697, aged sixty-five. Her paintings have a good deal of nature, but the colouring is stiff and heavy.
