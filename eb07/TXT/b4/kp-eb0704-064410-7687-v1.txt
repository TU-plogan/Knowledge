BION, a bucolic poet and native of Smyrna, who lived at the same time with Ptolemy Philadelphus, whose reign reached from the fourth year of the 123d Olympiad to the second year of the 133d. He was an incomparable poet, if we may believe the lamentations of his disciple Moschus; and the few pieces of his which have descended to us are indeed creditable to his muse.

Bion, surnamed βorystheηites, because he was of Borysthenes, was a philosopher possessed of much wit, but of little religion. He flourished about the 120th Olympiad. Like other profane persons, he became superstitious as often as he felt sick, and thus verified the maxim which ascribes a similar tendency to a much greater personage.
