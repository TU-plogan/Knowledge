BELBEIS, a considerable town of Egypt, on the frontier towards Syria. It was formerly considered the bulwark of the kingdom on that side, and was defended by very strong fortifications; but these were suffered to fall into decay till 1798, when Bonaparte ordered them to be put in repair. The population is not now supposed to exceed 5000. Belbeis is thirty-five miles north-east of Cairo.
