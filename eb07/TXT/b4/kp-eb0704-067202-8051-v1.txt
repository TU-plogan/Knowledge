BLAISE, a military order instituted by the kings of Armenia, in honour of St Blaise, anciently bishop of Sebasta in that country, the patron saint of that nation. Justinian calls them knights of St Blaise and St Mary, and places them not only in Armenia, but in Palestine. They made a particular vow to defend the religion of the church of Rome, and followed the rule of St Basil. The precise year of the institution of the knights of St Blaise is not known; but they appear to have commenced about the same time with the knights-templars and hospitallers, to the former of which they bore a near affinity.
