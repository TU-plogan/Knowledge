BARGE (Bargie, Dutch, from Barga, low Latin), a boat of state or pleasure, sometimes furnished with elegant canopies and cushions, equipped with a band of rowers, and decorated with flags and streamers. There are likewise barges of a smaller kind for the use of admirals and captains of ships of war. These are of a lighter frame, and may be easily hoisted into and out of the ships to which they belong.
