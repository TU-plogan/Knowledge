BISCARA, a town in the territory of Algiers, capital of the southern province of Zaab. The district is inhabited by a rude, stout race, who repair to Algiers, and seek the meanest and hardest employments, as sweeping chimneys, cleaning the streets, &c., and having gained a little money, return to their native territory. Biscara contains a castle, on which a few guns are mounted. The place is situated 150 miles S. S. E. of Algiers.
