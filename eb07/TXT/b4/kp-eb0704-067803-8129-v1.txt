BLAZONING, or Blazonry, in Heraldry, the decyphering the arms of noble families. The word originally signified the blowing or winding of a horn, and was introduced into heraldry as a term denoting the description of things borne in arms, with their proper significations and intendments, from an ancient custom observed by the heralds, who were the judges, of winding a horn at jousts and tournaments, when they explained and recorded the achievements of knights.
