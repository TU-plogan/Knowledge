BIDENTAL, in Roman Antiquity, a place blasted with lightning, which was immediately consecrated by an haruspex, with the sacrifice of a bidens. This place was afterwards accounted sacred, and it was unlawful to enter it or to tread upon it; for which reason it was commonly Surrounded with a ditch, wall, hedge, ropes, or other kind of fence.
