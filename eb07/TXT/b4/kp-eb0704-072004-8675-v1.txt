BLUE John, a name applied by the Derbyshire miners to the nodular variety of fluorspar from the Odin mine near Castleton, which in that part of England is turned into vases, and polished for various ornamental purposes.

Blue Vitriol, the sulphate of copper; a salt of a fine blue or bluish-green colour, containing 32âˆ™13 per cent, of copper, 31*57 of sulphuric acid, and 36*30 of water. By surgeons it is employed as an escharotic and astringent, and in the arts it is turned to account in dyeing, printing of cotton, and the like. It owes its existence in nature to the decomposition of other minerals, particularly copper pyrites, and, after having undergone the process of purification, forms regular crystals of a blue colour. It reddens litmus paper, and is soluble in about four parts of cold and two of boiling water. Its chief localities are the Ram-melsberg near Goslar, in the Hartz; Anglcsea in England; and Fahlun in Sweden.
