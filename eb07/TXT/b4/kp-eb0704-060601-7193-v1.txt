BETTOORIAH, a district in the province of Bengal, situated principally between the 24th and 25th degrees of north latitude, now comprehended, with its capital Nat-tore, in the larger division of Raujeshy. It is fertile, and well adapted for the cultivation of rice; being watered bythe Ganges, which is the principal river, and being besides intersected in all directions by smaller rivers, watercourses, and internal lakes, which in the height of the rains join and form one sheet of water.
