BEINASCHI, Giovanni Battista, called Cavalier Beinaschi, an historical painter, and a Piedmontese, was born in 1634. He studied at Rome under the direction of Pietro del Po; and some authors affirm that he was afterwards the disciple of Lan franc. He was a good designer; and as a public acknowledgement of his merit, the honour of knighthood was conferred upon him.
