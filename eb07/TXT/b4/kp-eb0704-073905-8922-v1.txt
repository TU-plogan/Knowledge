BOLANDUS, John, a famous Jesuit, born at Tille-tnont in the Netherlands, in 1696. He distinguished himself by writing the lives of the saints, under the title of Aeta Sanctorum, of which he published five volumes in folio, but died while he was labouring at the sixth, in the seventieth year of his age. The continuators of that work are called Bolandists.
