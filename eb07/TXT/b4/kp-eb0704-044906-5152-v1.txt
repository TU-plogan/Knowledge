BATMANSON, John, prior of the Carthusian monastery, or Charter-house, London. He was for some time a student at Oxford, but it does not appear that he took any degree in that university. He was intimately acquainted with Edward Lee, archbishop of York, at whose request he wrote against Erasmus and Luther. He died in the year 1531, and was buried in the chapel belonging to the Charter-house. According to Bale, lie was a proud forward person; and Erasmus, in one of his letters to the bishop of Winchester, calls him an ignorant fellow. Pits, on the contrary, gives him the character of a man of singular genius, zeal, piety, and learning. He wrote, l. Animadversiones in Annotationes Erasmi in Nov. Testamentum; 2. A Treatise against some of Lutherâ€™s works, which, as well as the former production, he afterwards retracted; 3. Commentaria in Proverbia Solomonis; 4. In Cantica Canticorum; 5. De unica Magdalena; 6. Institutiones Noviciorum; 7. De Contemptu Mundi; 8. De Christo duodeni; 9. On the words, Missus est, &c.
