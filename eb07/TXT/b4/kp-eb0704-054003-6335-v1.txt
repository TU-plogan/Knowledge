BEIT el. Fakih, an unwalled town of Arabia, situated on a barren sandy plain, protected by a castle, in which the governor resides, against the predatory incursions of the Arabs. It carries on an extensive trade in coffee, which grows in the hills, distant thirty-six miles, and is carried to Mocha, the shipping port, and thence exported to Egypt, the East Indies, and to Europe. European houses have had residents in this place, and merchants resort to it from all quarters of the East. The Persians have a caravan which travels to Bussorah; the Turkish and Russian caravans join those of Smyrna; and the Barbary and African caravans join that of Cairo. The trade of Beit el Fakih is carried on solely by the caravans; and the coffee is either sold for specie or for such goods as are required for the use of the inhabitants. It is twenty-four miles E.S.E. of Loheia and Hodeida. Long. 43.23. E. Lat. 14. 32. N.
