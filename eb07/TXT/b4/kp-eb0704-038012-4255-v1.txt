BARLAeUS, Gaspar, professor of philosophy at Amsterdam, and one of the best Latin poets of the seventeenth century. There was scarcely any thing great that happened in the world, while he lived, but he made a pompous elegy upon it, when reasons of state opposed no obstacle to it. He was a great defender of Arminius, and showed his abilities in history by his relation of what passed in Brazil during the government of Count Maurice of Nassau, published in 1647. He died the year after.
