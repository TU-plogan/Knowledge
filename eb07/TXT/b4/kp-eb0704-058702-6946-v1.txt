BERME, in Fortification, a space of ground left at the foot of the rampart, on the side next the country, designed to receive the ruins of the rampart, and prevent their filling up the fosse. It is sometimes palisadoed for the greater security, and in Holland it is generally planted with a quickset hedge. It is also called liziere, relais, foreland, retrait, pays de souris, &c.
