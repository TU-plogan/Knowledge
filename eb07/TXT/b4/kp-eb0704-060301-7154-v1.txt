BETHEL, in Ancient Geography, a city of Samaria, on the borders of the tribe of Benjamin, anciently called Luz. Bethel was properly the place of Jacobâ€™s vision; and Luz, or Lus, an adjoining town, afterwards called Bethel, the former name being lost in that of Bethel. It was twelve miles to the north-east of Jerusalem.
