BERNARDINES, an order of monks founded by Robert, abbot of MolÃªme, and reformed by St Bernard. They wear a white robe with a black scapulary, and when they officiate are clothed with a large gown, which is all white, and has large sleeves, with a hood of the same colour. The Bernardines differ very little from the Cistercians, and trace their origin to about the beginning of the twelfth century.
