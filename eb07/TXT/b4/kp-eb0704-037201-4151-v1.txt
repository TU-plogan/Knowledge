BARCA, the name which has been given by the Arabs to an extensive country between Tripoli and Egypt, occupying the site of the ancient Cyrenaica. It is from this identity, and from the monuments which it presents, that the region in question is now chiefly interesting. Indeed, since the important expeditions of Pacho and Beechey have made us well acquainted with the country, it is under the classic name that it is almost exclusively recognized. We shall therefore describe it and its ancient monuments under the head of Cyrenaica.
