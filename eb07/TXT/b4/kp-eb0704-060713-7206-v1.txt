BEYRAMICH, a city of Asia Minor, the capital of the district called Troas, which belongs to the pasha of the Dardanelles. It is an extensive place, and the houses are better built and more regularly disposed than in Constantinople. Many antiquities are to be seen in this place and the vicinity; amongst which are several sarcophagi, consisting of entire blocks of granite, converted to ordinary purposes in the street. It is distant about sixty miles from the Dardanelles.
