BARMOUTH, a small market-town in the county of Merioneth, in North Wales, 223 miles from London. It is the only port in that division of the Welsh shore, and is much frequented in the summer as a bathing place, to which the picturesque scenery in the neighbourhood largely contributes. It is included in the parish of Corwen in the population returns, and thus the number of inhabitants cannot be ascertained, but they are estimated at about 1000.
