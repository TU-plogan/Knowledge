BARON, Robert, a dramatic author, who lived during the reign of Charles I. and the protectorship of Oliver Cromwell. He received the earlier part of his education at Cambridge, after which he became a member of Grayâ€™s Inn. During his residence at the university he wrote a novel called the Cyprian Academy, in which he introduced the first two of the dramatic pieces mentioned below. The third of them is a much more regular and perfect play, and was probably written when the author had attained a riper age. The names of these productions are, 1. Deorum Dona, a masque; 2. Gripus and Hegio, a pastoral; and 3. Mirza, a tragedy. Mr Baron had a great intimacy with Howell the traveller, in whose collection of Letters there is one addressed to this gentleman, who was then resident at Paris.
