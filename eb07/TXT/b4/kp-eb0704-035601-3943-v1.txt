BAPTISMAL Vow or Covenant, a profession of obedience to the laws of Christ, which persons in the ancient church made before baptism. It was an indispensable part of the obligation on catechumens before they were admitted to the ceremony of regeneration. The vow was made by turning to the east, for what mystical reason is not well agreed on.

Baptismal Presents, in use in Germany, were made by the sponsors to the infant, and consisted of money, plate, or even sometimes fiefs of lands, which by the laws of the country were to be kept for the child until he became of age; the parents having only the trust, not the right of disposing of them.
