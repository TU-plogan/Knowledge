                <p><label type="entry">VULCAN</label>, in Pagan worship the god of subterraneous
                    fire and metals, was the son of Jupiter and Juno; and was said to be so
                    remarkably deformed, that his father threw him down from heaven to the isle of
                    Lemnos, in which fall he broke his leg, and there he set up his forge, and
                    taught men how to soften and polish brass and iron. Thence he removed to the
                    Liparian isles, near Sicily, where, by the assistance of the Cyclops, he made
                    Jupiter’s thunderbolts, and armour for the other gods. Notwithstanding the
                    deformity of his person, he had a passion for Minerva, and by Jupiter’s consent
                    paid his addresses to her, but without success. He was however more fortunate in
                    his suit to Venus; but after their marriage she chose Mars for her gallant, and
                    Vulcan exposed them to the ridicule of the other gods, by taking them in a
                    net.</p>
