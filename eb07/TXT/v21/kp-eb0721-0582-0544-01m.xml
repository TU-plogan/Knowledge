                <p><label type="entry">VALDEPENNAS</label>, a town of Spain, in the province of La
                    Mancha and the partido of Ciudad Real, of which partido it is the capital. It is
                    surrounded with walls, is well built, having a college, three churches, nine
                    monasteries and five hospitals, with about 9000 inhabitants. It has some
                    manufactures of gloves and woollen goods, and some tanneries, <pb break="no"

                    /> and is celebrated for the wine which bears its name. In taste and colour it
                    resembles the best of the Burgandy wine. In former times, a portion of it was
                    always engaged for the table of the king; but very little of it finds its way to
                    other countries, from the want of casks to contain it; and from being conveyed
                    in goats’ skins it acquires a disagreeable flavour. Good wheat is produced in
                    tne neighbourhood. The town is about eighty miles south-east from Toledo, and
                    one hundred and ten south of Madrid.</p>
