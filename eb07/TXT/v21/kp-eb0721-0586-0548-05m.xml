                <p><label type="entry">VALERIUS MAXIMUS</label>, a Latin writer of the age of
                    Tiberius. His <hi rend="italic">praenomen</hi> is by some supposed to have been
                    Publius, by others Marcus. We learn from different passages of his own work,
                    that he served in Asia with Sextus Pompeius, and returned to Rome after the
                    death of Sejanus, or towards the end of the reign of Tiberius. This S. Pompeius
                    was consul during the year when Augustus died. The work of Valerius, “Dictorum
                    Factorumque memorabilium libri novem,” he inscribed to the successor of that
                    emperor. It is valuable, not from any peculiar elegance of diction, but for its
                    copious and variegated collection of ancient anecdotes of public and private
                    life. According to the opinion of some critics, his composition has not
                    descended to our times in its original form, but as it was reduced to an
                    epitome, either by Julius Paris, or by Januarius Nepotianus. It is however far
                    from being certain that his work was remodelled. See Vossius de Historicis
                    Latinis, p. 123, and Fabricii Bibliotheca Latina, tom. ii. p. 50. edit.
                    Ernesti.</p>
                <p>The earliest edition of Valerius Maximus is supposed to have been printed at
                    Strasburg by Mentelin. It is a folio volume without date, but conjectured to be
                    at least as early as the year 1470. An edition which appeared soon after this
                    period, has very frequently been described as the first. It was printed by P.
                    Schoeffer de Gernshem, Mogunt. 1471, fol. And the same year produced an edition
                    by V. de Spira, Venet. 1471, fol. After some intermediate editions, other two
                    proceeded from the press of Aldus, Venet. 1502,1514, 8vo. Many editions
                    afterwards appeared, several with annotations by Pighius, and a few with brief
                    notes by Lipsius. Among the early impressions, we may specify that which
                    contains the annotations of Pighius and Colerus, Francof. 1627, 8vo. A very
                    elaborate and valuable edition, accompanied with a great body of notes, was at
                    length published by Torrenius, Leidae, 1726, 4to. Several other editions have
                    more recently appeared; and among these we may venture to recommend that of
                    Kapp. Lipsiae, 1782, 8vo.</p>
