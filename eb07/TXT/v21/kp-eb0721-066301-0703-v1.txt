VOICE, a sound produced in the throat and mouth of an animal, by peculiar organs.

Voices are either articulate or inarticulate. Articulate voices are those whereof several conspire together to form some assemblage or little system of sounds; such are the voices expressing the letters of an alphabet, numbers of which joined together form words. Inarticulate voices are such as are not organized, or assembled into words; such as the barking of dogs, the braying of asses, the hissing of serpents, the singing of birds, &c.

For a description of the organs of the voice, see Ανατομυ and Physiology. Voice, in Grammar, a circumstance in verbs, by which they come to be considered as either active or passive, i.e. either expressing an action impressed on another subject, as I beat ; or receiving it from another, as I am beaten. See Grammar .
