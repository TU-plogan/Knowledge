                <p><label type="entry">VARRO ATACINUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Publius
                        Terentius</hi></label>, a Latin poet, was born in the province of Narbonne
                    in the year 82 before the Christian era. According to Jerom, he derived his <hi
                        rend="italic">cognomen</hi> from a village named Atace; but as we discover
                    no other trace of such a village, the account of Porphyrion, that he derived it
                    from the river Atace, appears more probable. His name indicates a Roman origin.
                    Jerom likewise informs us that, at the age of thirty-five, he applied himself
                    with great ardour to the study of Greek literature. Horace, Sat. i. 10. 46,
                    alludes to him as an unsuccessful writer of satires:</p>
                <p>Hoc erat, experto frustra Varrone Atacino</p>
                <p>Atque qιibusdam aliis, melius quod scribere possem, Inventore minor.</p>
                <p>Wüllner concludes, that of a living poet Horace would not have spoken in such
                    terms. Adopting Bentley’s chronology, <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=602" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0602-0564"
                    /> according to which, the satire that contains this passage was written in the
                    year 37 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c</hi>., he infers that Varro did not exceed the
                    age of forty-five. The conjecture is not devoid of plausibility, but cannot be
                    admitted as certain.</p>
                <p>Varro Atacinus is extolled by several of the ancient writers. Velleius Paterculus
                    classes him with Lucretius and Catullus. Quintilian mentions him as a poet who
                    had acquired a name. He is likewise mentioned by Ovid, Propertius, and
                        Statius.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>With
                            respect to the allusion of Statius, see Vossius de Histories Latinis. p.
                            77.</p></note> Virgil adopted several of his verses with little or no
                    alteration. It is however to be regretted that, with the exception of a few
                    fragments, all his works have perished. These fragments are to be found in
                    various collections, and, among the rest, in Wernsdorfs “Poetae Latini Minores.”
                    Altenburgi, 1788-99, 6 tom. 8vo. They are incorporated in Wüllner’s learned
                    dissertation on the life und writings of the author.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>‘ De P. Terentii Varronis Atacini Vita et
                            Scriptis Commentario. Scripsit Dr. Franciscus Wüllner. Monastfrii, 1829,
                            4to.</p></note> ' One of his works was a version of the Argonautica of
                    Apollonius Rhodius; but from the fragments which remain. It does not appear to
                    have been a close version. Another of his works, “Bellum Sequanicum," was an
                    epic or historical poem in celebration of Caesar’s recent victories. A third was
                    a metrical <hi rend="italic">chorographia;</hi> of which Ruhnkenius supposes his
                        <hi rend="italic">Europa,</hi> quoted by Festus, to have formed a part.<note

                    his works, so far as they are enumerated, consisted of elegies, satires, and
                    epigrams. (x.)</p>
