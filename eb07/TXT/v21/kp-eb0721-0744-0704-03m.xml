                <p><label type="entry">VOW</label>, a solemn religious promise or oath. The use of
                    vows is found in most religions. They form a considerable part of the Pagan
                    worship, being made either in consequence of some deliverance, under some
                    pressing necessity, or for the success of some enterprize. Among the Jews, all
                    vows were to be voluntary, and made by persons wholly in their own power; and if
                    such person made a vow in any thing lawful and possible, he was obliged to
                    fulfil it. If he appointed no particular time for accomplishing his vow, he was
                    bound to do it instantly, lest by delay he should prove less able, or be
                    unwilling to execute his promise. Among the papists, a person is constituted a
                    religious by taking three vows, that of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Vows
                    among the Romans, signified sacrifices, offerings, presents, and prayers made
                    for the Caesars, and emperors, particularly for their prosperity and the
                    continuance of their empire. These were at first made every five years, then
                    every fifteen, and afterwards every twenty, and were called <hi rend="italic"
                        >quinquennalia, decennalia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vicennalia.</hi></p>
