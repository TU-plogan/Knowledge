VIRTUOSO, an Italian term introduced into English, signifying a man of curiosity and learning, or one who loves and promotes the arts and sciences. But among us the term seems to be appropriated to those who apply themselves to some curious and quaint rather than immediately useful art or study; as antiquaries, collectors of rarities of any kind, microscopical observers, &c.
