VIGER, Francois, more generally known by the name of Franciscus Vigerus, a learned Jesuit, was a native of Rouen, and died there in the year 1647. His treatise entitled "De praecipuis Graecae Dictionis Idiotismis liber,” is said to have been originally published in 1632. The subsequent editions are very numerous, and some of them are enriched by the emendations and additions of Hoogeveen, Zeunius, and Hermann. An edition, including the annotations of all the three, has been printed in our own country. Glasg. 1823, 8vo. In this improved form, the work possesses great value. Viger published an edition of Eusebius, “De Preparatione Evangelica,” accompanied with notes and a new Latin version. Paris. 1628, fol.
