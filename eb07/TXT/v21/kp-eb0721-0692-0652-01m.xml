                <p><label type="entry">VINCI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Leonardo da</hi></label>, an
                    illustrious Italian painter, descended from a noble Tuscan family, was bom in
                    the castle of Vinci near Florence, in 1445. He was placed under Andrea Verochia,
                    a celebrated painter in that city; but soon surpassed him and all his
                    predecessors so much, as to be reputed the master of the third or golden age of
                    modern painting. But his studies were far from terminating here: no man’s genius
                    was more universal; he applied himself to arts, to literature, and to the
                    accomplishments of the body; and he excelled in every thing which he attempted.
                    Lewis Sforza, duke of Milan, prevailed on him to be director of the academy for
                    architecture which he had just established, where Leonardo soon banished all the
                    Gothic fashions, and reduced every thing to the happy simplicity of the Greek
                    and Roman style. By the duke’s order he constructed the famous aqueduct that
                    supplies the city of Milan with water: this canal goes by the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">Mortesana,</hi> being above 200 miles in length, and conducts
                    the water of the river Adda to the walls of the city. In 1479, he was desired to
                    construct some new device for the entertainment of Louis XII. of France, who was
                    then to make his entrance into Milan. Leonardo accordingly made a very curious
                    automaton in the form of a lion, which marched out to meet the king, reared up
                    on its hinder legs before him, and opening its breast, displayed an escutcheon
                    with fleurs-de-lis quartered on it. The disorders of Lombardy, with the
                    misfortunes of his patrons the Sforzi, obliging Leonardo to quit Milan, he
                    retired to Florence, where he flourished under the Medici. Here he raised the
                    envy of Michael Angelo, who was his contemporary; and Raphael, from the study of
                    his works, acquired his best manner of designing. At length, on the invitation
                    of Francis L, he removed to France, when above seventy years of age, where the
                    journey and change of climate threw him into his last sickness: he languished
                    for some months at Fontainbleau, where the king came frequently to see him; and
                    one day rising up in his bed to acknowledge the honour done him, he fainted, and
                    Francis supporting him, Leonardo died in his arms. His death happened in 1520.
                    Some of his paintings are to be seen in England and other countries, but the
                    greatest part of them are at Florence and in France. He composed a great number
                    of discourses on curious subjects; but with the exception of his treatise on the
                    Art of Painting, none of them has been published.</p>
