                <p><label type="entry">VAR</label>, a department of the south-east of France, formed
                    out of the eastern part of ancient Provence. It extends in north latitude from
                    43° 2' to 44° 0', and in east longitude from 5° 29' to 6’ 59' and comprehends
                    2854 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the department of the Lower
                    Alps, on the north-east by Piedmont, on the south-east and the south by the
                    Mediterranean sea, and on the west by the mouths of the Rhone. It is divided
                    into four arron-disements, which are subdivided into thirty-five cantons, and
                    those into 210 communes.</p>
                <p>The population in 1836 amountcd to 323,404 persons, all of whom adhere to the
                    Romish communion, or, if there are any protestants, they are in no place so
                    numerous as to form a congregation for public worship. The language of the
                    common people is the Provençal, but in the cities and towns the French is
                    gradually driving out the ancient tongue. The face of the country presents
                    mountains, rocks, hills, valleys, and small plains, with some beautiful and even
                    romantic prospects. The north and north-east parts are the most mountainous, as
                    they contain a portion of the maritime Alps, proceeding out of Piedmont, which,
                    for the most part, are bare of trees, and, especially on their south sides,
                    exhibit naked perpendicular precipices. These are all calcareous, but a range
                    extends from Hieres to Frejus, which are of granite, and more thick of trees,
                    among which are cork, chesnut, cestus, myrtle, and firs. In the western part is
                    the remarkable mountain Saint Beaume, with a labyrinth in the calcareous
                    substance of it, that extends from the western boundary of the department, the
                    mouths of the Rhone, to Ollioules, and is well known by the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">les faux d’Ollioules.</hi> In general the soil is far from
                    fertile, and is more indebted to the labour of the inhabitants than to its
                    quality for its powers of production. It is better adapted for fruits, such as
                    grapes and olives, than for wheat, barley, or other grain.</p>
                <p>The department is watered by numerous mountain streams. The river which gives
                    name to the department, rises in the mountain Camelione in Piedmont, receives
                    the water of the Esteron, forms many small islands, and, after a course of sixty
                    miles, enters the Mediterranean; but it is not navigable in any part. Along the
                    sea-shore are numerous pools and morasses, some of which communicate with the
                    sea.</p>
                <p>The climate is mild, the great heats of summer being tempered by the breezes from
                    the sea and the mountains. Rain is unusual, except when the wind drives the
                    clouds from the sea. With the exception of about twenty days, there is a
                    continual spring; and even in those few days the thermometer seldom sinks to the
                    freezing point. In January the fields are clothed with fresh green, and in
                    February the trees put forth their blossoms.</p>
                <p>Agriculture is in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> neglected state, so that the corn
                    produced does not supply half the consumption, and in summer the grass is so
                    burnt up, that the cattle must be driven to the mountains for pasture. Neither
                    cows, sheep, nor horses are abundant, but many swine are bred and fattened. The
                    chief beasts of burden are asses and mules.</p>
                <p>The chief productions are wine, oil, silk, and the better kinds of fruit,
                    oranges, citrons, and lemons, some dried fruits, a few dates, and abundance of
                    chesnuts and other kinds of nuts. Honey and wax are collected in considerable
                    quantities. There are no minerals raised, except about 600 tons of fossil coal.
                    On the sea-shore a sufficiency of salt is produced by the natural heat of the
                    sun. The fishery on the coast yields abundance of tunny, anchovies, sardinias,
                    and mackerel, with a small but delicate small fish called the monnat. The
                    manufactures are inconsiderable, and merely for home consumption. The department
                    elects three deputies for the legislative chamber.</p>
