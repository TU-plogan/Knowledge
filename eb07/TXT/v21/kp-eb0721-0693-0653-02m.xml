                <p><label type="entry">VIOLIN</label>, a bow-instrument of considerable compass, and
                    great powers of expression and execution. Its origin is obscure. The best
                    violins are those of the old Cremona makers, Jerome, Anthony, and Nicholas
                    Amati, and Stradivarius and Guarnerius, and F. and T. and G. B. Ruggiero. Next
                    in quality are those of Jacob Steiner, and of the two Klotz, father and son,
                    Tyrolese makers. The difference between the tone of the Cremona violins and the
                    Tyrolese has been compared to the difference between the tone of a flute and a
                    clarinet. The violin has four strings, tuned G, D, A, E, reckoning upwards. The
                    lowest string is covered with fine silvered copper wire. Some persons have used
                    silver, or even gold wire, which does not corrode like the copper. Gross
                    impositions are often practised by unprincipled dealers in pseudo-Cremona
                    violins. Like <hi rend="italic">copies</hi> of old pictures, they deceive many
                    purchasers. Many of the finest violins of the old makers have been destroyed by
                    ignorant repairers, or by capricious alterations made at the desire of ignorant
                    amateurs. See article Music.</p>
