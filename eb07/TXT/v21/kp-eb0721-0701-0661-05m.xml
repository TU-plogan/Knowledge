                <p><label type="entry">VITRUVIUS <hi rend="smallcaps">Pollio, Marcus</hi></label>,
                    an ancient architect of great name, is sometimes represented as a native of
                    Rome; but, if we may rely on the opinion of Maffei, there are divers reasons for
                    supposing him to have been a native of Verona; and other writers are disposed to
                    transfer the honour of his birth-place to Formiae, a city of Campania, and now
                    called Mola di Gaeta. His <hi rend="italic">praenomen</hi> is not less doubtful
                    than his country. In the first edition of his work, he is called Lucius. A.
                    appears in some manuscripts. but M., or Marcus, is most frequently to be found.
                    Of his personal history, any notices which we possess are almost entirely
                    derived from his own work. In the preface to the sixth book, he mentions that he
                    was indebted to his parents for a good education. In the preface to the second,
                    he speaks of himself as being small of stature, advanced in years, and having
                    his strength impaired by disease. From the preface to the first, we learn that
                    he was personally known to Julius Caesar; that after his death, he was
                    recommended by Octavia to her brother Augustus; and from this emperor he
                    obtained a permanent provision, which placed him beyond the fear of want. The
                    services which he rendered were those of a military engineer: “Ad apparitionem
                    balistarum, et scorpionum, reliquorumque tormentorum refectionem, fui praesto.”
                    His treatise “De Architectura,” divided into tcn books, is addressed to
                    Augustus. This is a curious and valuable relique of ancient art and literature.
                    The author was evidently a man of superior talents and learning, nor was his
                    knowledge limited to one department: he indeed appears to have been instructed
                    in general literature, and to have been well acquainted with the Greek
                    writers.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> of Vitruvius, superintended by Jo.
                    Sulpicius Verulanus, is in folio, without place or date, but is supposed to have
                    been printed at Rome about 1486. It is accompanied by the treatise of Frontinus,
                        <hi rend="italic">“De</hi> Aquaeductibus,” or, as it is there described, “De
                    Aquis quae in Urbem influunt.” Both treatises were reprinted, Florent. 1496,
                    fol. They were afterwards reprinted by Junta, Florent. 1513, 8vo. Passing
                    various other editions of Vitruvius, we arrive at that of Guilielmus Philander,
                    Lugd. 1552, 4to. The annotations of Philander, who is reckoned one of the
                    principal commentators on this author, had formerly been published in a separate
                    form, Romae, 1544, 8vo. This edition was followed by that of Daniel Barbarus,
                    Venet. 1567, fol. After a long interval appeared the edition of Jo. de Laet,
                    Lugd. Bat. 1649, fol. It is splendidly printed, but is less distinguished for
                    accuracy. With the annotations of Philander, Barbarus, and others. It contains
                    some appendages of less importance. One of these is a Latin translation of Sir
                    Henry Wotton’s Elements of Architecture. A more suitable accompaniment is the
                    “Lexicon Vitruvianum” of Bernardinus Baldus. We now αescend to the edition of A.
                    Rode, Berol. 1800, 2 tom. 4to. It was speedily followed by the edition of J.
                    Glo. Schneider, Lips. 1807-8, 3 tom. 8vo. Another elaborate edition was
                    afterwards undertaken, “textu ex recensione codicum emendato, cum
                    exercitationibus notisque novissimis J. Poleni, et commentariis variorum,
                    additis nunc primum studiis Simonis Stratico.” Utini, 1825-9, tom. 1-3,4to.
                    Whether the fourth and concluding volume has made its appearance, we have not
                    ascertained. An English translation of Vitruvius was executed by William Newton,
                    Lond. 1771-91, 2 parts, fol. Wilkins published a translation of “The Civil
                    Architecture of Vitruvius, comprising those books of the author which relate to
                    the public and private Edifices of the Ancients. With an introduction,
                    containing an historical view of the rise and progress of architecture amongst
                    the Greeks.” Lond. 1812-7, 2 vols. 4to. Of this work some copies are printed in
                    large folio.</p>
