VACUUM, in Philosophy, denotes a space void of all matter or body. It has been disputed whether there be in nature a perfect vacuum; but if bodies consist of material solid atoms. It is evident that there must be vacuities, or motion would be impossible. We can even produce something very near a vacuum in the receiver of an air-pump, and in the Toricellian tube.
