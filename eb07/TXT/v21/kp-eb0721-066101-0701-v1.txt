VITORIA, a city of Spain, in the province of Alava. It is built on the river Ladorra, which runs into the Ebro, on a plain which yields excellent wheat and other grain, but is surrounded with lofty and barren mountains. The walls round it are unfit for defence, but they render the city compact, and furnish very pleasant public walks. It has a large collegiate church, and several other religious buildings. The population amounts to about 8000, who are generally an industrious description of people. It has often been the theatre of war, and the celebrated battle gained there by the duke of Wellington, will transmit its name to distant ages. It is situated in Lat. 42. 53. 30.
