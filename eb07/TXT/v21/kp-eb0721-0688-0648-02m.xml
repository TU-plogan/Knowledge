                <p><label type="entry">VIGILANTIUS</label>, the bold opponent of ecclesiastical
                    corruptions in the fourth century, and the forerunner of those who have since
                    testified for scriptural truth, and protested against certain errors of the
                    ancient fathers. Others of the same, or of an earlier period, may have offered
                    some occasional opposition to superstitious practices, as they crept into the
                    church; but Vigilantius openly denounced relic and saint worshippers as <hi

                    <hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> He made an uncompromising attack upon the
                    obligation to celibacy, the adoration of saints, prayers for the dead, the use
                    of relics, and pilgrimages, and exposed their mischievous tendency, at the
                    critical time when they were sanctioned by such eminent men as Ambrose,
                    Chrysostom, Jerom, and Augustin. He was one of those resolute inquirers, who
                    dare to think for themselves, and who appear at intervals, after the lapse of
                    centuries, to remind Christians that they are to abide by the rule of thought
                    and action, which is laid down in the book of God’s revealed will, and are not
                    to be satisfied with any canon which cannot be examined by that standard. He may
                    therefore have a place given to him in that noble phalanx, in which Claude of
                    Turin, Valdo of Lyons, Luther, and Calvin, took their stand, for the defence of
                    the pure gospel.</p>
                <p>Vigilantius was bom about the year 360, at the foot of the Pyrenees, under the
                    warm sun which fertilizes Aquitaine, and in the midst of that majestic scenery
                    which calls forth latent genius, and gives a tone of independent character to
                    the native of the mountains. Calagorris,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the northern side of the Pyrenees, so named by a band of insurgents, who were
                    driven by Pompey from the Spanish borders, and settled on the Gallic

                    conduct them through the passes; and this brought the young mountaineer under
                    the notice of Sulpicius Severus, the historian, who took him into his service,
                    and employed him in the management of his estate, and in the sale of the wines

                    taken into the confidence of his patron, and lived with him more in the
                    character of a friend than a dependent. There are some beautiful letters still
                    extant, which passed between Sulpicius Severus and Paulinus of Nola, in which
                    Vigilantius is mentioned in the warmest terms of affection;<note anchored="true"

                    acquaintance with these two eminent persons Tor his first serious impressions.
                    Had he not been a man of uncommon strength of mind, he would have fallen into
                    the same errors which clouded their religious views. Happily and providentially,
                    however, he was enabled to turn their example to advantage, even on points in
                    which they were misguided, by avoiding the rocks on which they split; and he
                    became a reformer where he might have been a sceptic, or at least a scorner,
                    with such extravagancies before his eyes as they practised under the name of
                    religion. Sulpicius, in a season of great mental distress, went to Martin,
                    bishop of Tours,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sulp.
                            Sever, de Vita S. Mart. c. 26.</p></note> for instruction and
                    consolation; and it is probable that Vigilantius accompanied him on one or two
                    of his visits to that gloomy ascetic, in 392 or 393, and witnessed some of those
                    acts of austerity<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>" One
                            of them is thus described by Paulinus:</p><p>Quin et contexto setis

                    which proved Martin to be an impostor or a crazy fanatic, and opened the eyes of
                    the young man to the true character of a system, which turned the head of his
                    master, and made him the victim of a spiritual delusion.</p>
                <p>Sulpicius devoted the whole of his immense property to the exercise of almsgiving
                    and hospitality. His beautiful villas at Primuliac and Elusone, near Tholouse,
                    were made the asylums of the mendicant and the wayfaring man. He built churches;
                    he founded a monastery; he entertained strangers; he treated his domestics as if
                    they were his near relations; and he lived in the practice of every Christian
                        virtue.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Epist.
                            Paulini ad Sulp. Sev.</p></note> He watched, he prayed, he fasted. But
                    this was not enough. Wrought up to the highest pitch of religious fever by
                    Martin, and others of a disordered imagination, he believed that his oblations
                    of faith and piety would be unacceptable to heaven, unless they were accompanied
                    by the most rigid self-denial and self-infliction. But the more he tormented
                    himself, the more did fears, utterly inconsistent with the covenant of
                    reconciliation and the pardon of sins, offered in the gospel, prey upon his
                    heart and understanding. Vigilantius observed the melancholy and maddening
                    effects produced in the noble mind of his protector, and learnt to abominate the
                    lessons which degraded “the Christian Sallust,” as Sulpicius was called, to the
                    level of a credulous and extravagant narrator of false miracles.<note

                            Martin and of the hermits of Egypt, described by Sulpicius, in his Liber

                        Orientalium.</p></note></p>
                <p>He likewise had opportunities of seeing how leaven of the same kind worked in
                    Paulinus of Nola, and how it spoilt his Christianity. That illustrious and
                    amiable saint (for saint he was, in spite of his religious mistakes), was
                    persuaded by the advocates<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                            fourth century from the charge of fanaticism. See Epist. Hieron. ad
                            Paul. 49. Opera iv. par. ii. p. 563.</p></note> of an ascetic rule of
                    life, which was falsely called Christian perfection, to renounce the comfort and
                    privileges of wedlock, to live with his wife as if with a sister, to desert his
                    post of duty, to deny himself the necessaries of life, to abandon the world, to
                    practise severities on his person, and to have recourse to superstitious
                    observances, which reduced his body to a skeleton, and his mind to a state
                    bordering on imbecility.</p>
                <p>Vigilantius continued to pass his time in the society of Sulpicius, in Aquitaine,
                    or of Paulinus, in Campania, until the year 394 or 395, and with them he had the
                    best οppοrtunities of cultivating sacred learning, and of discussing theological
                    questions. But succeeding to considerable property on the death of his father,
                    about that time, he resolved to take <pb break="no"

                    introduction, which took place after he was in priest’s orders, was a turning
                    point in his life. The errors for which he might have had some respect, in
                    connection with such gentle and humble servants of God as Sulpicius and
                    Paulinus, (and never is error so dangerous as when recommended by good and holy
                    men), became disgusting in the sour and choleric monk of Bethlehem, whose
                    learning gave a sting to his acerbity. It was unendurable to be a spectator of
                    Jerom’s spiritual pride, and to hear him revile every body whose opinions were
                    opposed to his own, while he professed to make the birth-place of the meek and
                    lowly Jesus his abode, in order that he might be the better able to keep his
                    body in subjection. Their disputes ran high, and Jerom, who began by speaking of
                    Vigilantius as “the holy presbyter,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Hier. Op. iv. pars ii. p. 568.</p></note> and “Christian

                    him that was most expressive of contempt and resentment. He punned upon his
                    name, and called him <hi rend="italic">Dormitantius,</hi> and inveighed against
                    him as an ignorant pretender to learning.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Jerom’s terms of reproach applied to Vigilantius; but we search in vain for any
                    fair grounds of accusation in justification of such language, which has been
                    condemned by some of the best writers of the Romish church. No charges of
                    heterodoxy on the great doctrines of atonement and justification, no imputation
                    of doubtful faith on the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, are advanced against him.
                    The sum and substance of Jerom’s indictment amounts to this, that Vigilantius
                    denied the sanctity of relics; that he refused to worship and to burn lights at
                    the tombs of the martyrs, and to invocate saints; that he disapproved of vows of
                    celibacy, of pilgrimages, and of nocturnal watchings in cemeteries;<note

                    Christians were by their pagan calumniators. Jerom hated Vigilantius personally,
                    because he had accused him of inclining to some of the opinions of Origen.
                    Fleury admits that Jerom was too vehement in his controversy with Vigilantius;
                    and Erasmus makes use of a stronger expression, “debacchatur convitiis.”<note

                    in the Cottian Alps, the ancestors, as we have reason to believe, of the
                    Valdenses, among whom he found persons entertaining the same opinions as his
                    own. This visit may have been occasioned by a statement of Ambrose relating to
                    the opinions and practice of his mountain clergy. Claude, bishop of Turin, four
                    hundred years afterwards, was said to revive the sect of Vigilantius<note

                    advocated the same cause as Vigilantius, and his reproof of Exupe-rius, bishop

                    prove that there was a strong attempt, at this time, to correct those
                    superstitious practices of the church of the fourth century, which Vigilantius
                    denounced as having an idolatrous tendency. It is quite clear, that the
                    Aquitainian clergy leant, for the most part, towards the opinions of
                    Vigilantius, because nobody was found in southern Gaul to contradict him; and
                    for that reason Jerom undertook to rebuke and refute him, at the request of
                    Riparius and Desiderius. The influence of the Pyrenean presbyter was exercised
                    in another way; he employed much of his time and his fortune in the
                    transcription and circulation of copies of Scripture.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hier. Epist. ad Vigil. 36.</p></note></p>
                <p>The zeal of Vigilantius in his endeavour to check the progress of corrupt
                    innovation, was unremitting till the time of his death, which took place. It is
                    supposed, during that terrible invasion of the barbarians, the Alans and
                    Vandals, which desolated the south of Europe at the beginning of the fifth
                    century. In 401 and 403, and again in 406, we find Jerome writing against
                        him,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Vide Hier.
                            Opera, vol. iv. pars ii.</p></note> and describing his persevering
                    efforts in the dissemination of his principles; but after that no more mention
                    is made of him. The full benefit of his protests against antichristian novelties
                    was not felt, either in his lifetime or in the ages that immediately followed.
                    But he was one of those champions of the faith raised up in fulfilment of the
                    promise, that the gospel of truth shall never be without a witness; and it was
                    reserved for a happier era to establish the doctrines which he so faithfully
                    maintained. (<hi rend="smallcaps">d.f.</hi>)</p>
