                <p><label type="entry">VENUS</label>, in Pagan worship, the goddess of love and
                    beauty. Cicero mentions other two deities of this name, Venus, styled <hi
                        rend="italic">Urania</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coelestis,</hi> and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Venus Pandemos</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Popularis,</hi> the
                    wife of Vulcan, and the goddess of wanton and effeminate love. To the first the
                    Pagans ascribed no attributes but such as were agreeable to the strictest
                    chastity and virtue; and of this deity they admitted no corporeal resemblance,
                    she being only represented by the form of a globe, ending conically. Her
                    sacrifices were termed <hi rend="italic">nephalia,</hi> on account of their
                    sobriety. To her honey and wine were offered, and no animal except the heifer;
                    and on her altars the wood of figs, vines, or mulberries, was not suffered to be
                    burnt. The Romans dedicated a temple to this goddess, to whom they gave the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Verticordia;</hi> because she turned the hearts of lewd
                    women, and inspired them with modesty and virtue.</p>
                <p>But the most famous of these goddesses is the wife of Vulcan; who is represented
                    as springing from the froth of the sea. As soon as she was formed, she was laid
                    in a beautiful shell embellished with pearl, and wafted by gentle zephyrs to the
                    isle of Cythera, whence she sailed to Cyprus. At her landing, flowers rose
                    beneath her feet; she was received by the Hours, who braided her hair with
                    golden fillets; and then wafted her to heaven, where her charms appeared so
                    attractive, that most of the gods desired her in marriage; but Vulcan, by the
                    advice of Jupiter, gained possession by putting poppies into her nectar. As
                    Venus was the goddess of love and pleasure, the poets have been lavish in the
                    description of her beauties; and the painters and statuaries have endeavoured to
                    give her the most lovely form. Sometimes she is represented clothed in purple,
                    glittering with gems, her head crowned with roses, and drawn in an ivory car by
                    swans, doves, or sparrows; at others she stands attended by the Graces; but in
                    all positions, her son Cupid is her inseparable companion. She was honoured as
                    the mother of Hymenaeus, Cupid, AEneas, and the Graces, and was passionately
                    fond of Adonis and Anchises. This goddess was principally worshipped at Paphos
                    in Cyprus; and the sacrifices offered to her were white goats and swine, with
                    libations of wine, milk, and honey. Her victims were crowned with flowers, or
                    wreaths of myrtle.</p>
