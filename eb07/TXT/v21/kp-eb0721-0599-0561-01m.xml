                <p><label type="entry">VARNISH</label>, a clear limpid fluid, capable of hardening
                    without losing its transparency, used by painters, gilders, &amp;c. to give a
                    lustre to their works, in order to preserve them and defend them from the
                    air.</p>
                <p>A coat of varnish ought to possess the following properties. 1st. It must exclude
                    the action of the air; because wood and metals are varnished to defend them from
                    decay and rust. 2d. It must resist water; for otherwise the effect of the
                    varnish could not be permanent. 3d. It ought not to alter such colours as are
                    intended to be preserved by this means. It is necessary therefore that a varnish
                    should be easily extended or spread over the surface, without leaving pores or
                    cavities; that it should not crack or scale; and that it should resist water.
                    Now resins are the only bodies that possess these properties. Resins
                    consequently must be used as the bases of varnish. The question which of course
                    presents itself must then be, how to dispose them for this use; and for this
                    purpose they must be dissolved, as minutely divided as possible, and combined in
                    such a manner that the imperfections of those which might be disposed to scale
                    may be corrected by others.</p>
                <p>Resins may be dissolved by three agents, 1st, By fixed oil. 2d, By volatile oil.
                    3d, By alcohol. And accordingly we have three kinds of varnish; the fat or oily
                    varnish, essential varnish, and spirit varnish. Before a resin is dissolved in a
                    fixed oil. It is necessary to render the oil drying. For this purpose the oil is
                    boiled with metallic oxides; in which operation the mucilage of the oil combines
                    with the metal, while the oil itself unites with the oxygen of the oxide. To
                    accelerate the drying of this varnish. It is necessary to add oil of turpentine.
                    The essential varnishes consist of a solution of resin in oil of turpentine. The
                    varnish being applied, the essential oil flies off, and leaves the resin. This
                    is used only for paintings. When resins are dissolved in alcohol, the varnish
                    dries very speedily, and is subject to crack; but this fault is corrected by
                    adding a small quantity of turpentine to the mixture, which renders it brighter,
                    and less brittle when dry.</p>
                <p>We shall now give the method of preparing a number pf varnishes for different
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>4 <hi rend="italic">Varnish for Toilet-boxes, Cases, Fans,</hi> &amp;c.—Dissolve
                    two ounces of gum mastich and eight ounces gum sandarach in a quart of alcohol;
                    then add four ounces of Venice turpentine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A Varnish for Wainscots, cane chairs, Iron chairs,
                        Grates.—</hi> Dissolve in a quart of alcohol eight ounces of gum sandarach,
                    two ounces of seed lac, four ounces of rosin; then add six ounces of Venice
                    turpentine. If the varnish is wished to produce a red colour, more of the lac
                    and less of sandarach should be used, and a little dragon's blood should be
                    added. This varnish is so thick that two layers of it are equal to four or five
                    of another.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A Varnish for Fiddles, and other Musical Instruments—</hi> Put
                    four ounces of gum sandarach, two ounces of lac, two ounces of gum mastich, an
                    ounce of gum elemi, into a quart of alcohol, and hang them over a slow fire till
                    they are dissolved; then add two ounces of turpentine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Varnish in order to employ Vermilion for painting
                        Equipages—</hi> Dissolve in a quart of alcohol six ounces of sandarach,
                    three ounces of gum lac, and four ounces of rosin; afterwards add six ounces of
                    the cheapest kind of turpentine; mix with it a proper quantity of vermilion when
                    it is io be used <hi rend="italic">Gold-coloured Varnish—</hi> Pound separately
                    four ounces of stick lac, four ounces of gamboge, four ounces of dragon’s blood,
                    four ounces of anotta, and one ounce of saffron: put each of them separately
                    into a quart of alcohol, and expose them for five days in a narrow-mouthed
                    bottle to the sun, or keep them during that time in a very warm room, shaking
                    them every now and then to hasten the solution. When they are melted, mix them
                    together. More or less of each of these ingredients will give the different
                    tints of gold according as they are combined. In order to make silver imitate
                    gold exactly when covered with this varnish, the quantity of ingredients must be
                    somewhat greater. The method of gilding silver leaf, &amp;c. with this varnish,
                    is as follows: The silver leaf being fixed, in the same manner as gold leaf, by
                    the interposition of proper glutinous matters, the varnish is spread upon the
                    piece with a brush or pencil. The first coat being dry, the piece is again and
                    again washed over with the varnish till the colour appears sufficiently deep.
                    What is called <hi rend="italic">gilt leather,</hi> and many picture frames,
                    have no other than this counterfeit gilding. Washing them with a little
                    rectified spirit of wine affords a proof of this; the spirit dissolving the
                    varnish, and leaving the silver leaf of its own whiteness. For plain frames,
                    thick tinfoil may be used instead of silver. The tin leaf, fixed on the piece
                    with glue, is to be burnished, then polished with emery and a fine linen cloth,
                    and afterwards with putty applied in the same manner: being then lacquered over
                    with the varnish five or six times. It looks very nearly like burnished gold.
                    The same varnish, macle with a less proportion of the colouring materials, is
                    also applied on works of brass; both for heightening the colour of the metal to
                    a resemblance with that of gold, and for preserving it from being tarnished or
                    corroded by the air.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Oil Varnishes</hi> Gum copal and amber are the substances
                    principally employed in oil varnishes. They possess the properties necessary for
                    varnishes, solidity and transparency. The copal being whitest, is used for
                    varnishing light, the amber for dark colours. It is best to dissolve them before
                    mixing them with the oil, because by this means they are in less danger of being
                    scorched, and at the same time the varnish is more beautiful. They should be
                    melted in a pot on the fire; they are in a proper state for receiving the oil
                    when they give no resistance to the iron spatula, and when they run off from it
                    drop by drop. The oil employed should be a drying oil, and perfectly free from
                    grease. It should be poured into the copal or amber by little and little,
                    constantly stirring the ingredients at the same time with the spatula. When the
                    oil is well mixed with the copal or amber, take it off the fire; and when it is
                    pretty cool, pour in a greater quantity of the essence of turpentine than the
                    oil that was used. After the varnish is made. It should be passed through a
                    linen cloth. Oil varnishes become thick by keeping; but when they are to be
                    used, it is only necessary to pour in a little essence of turpentine, and to put
                    them for a little on the fire. The turpentine is necessary in oil varnishes to
                    make them dry properly; generally twice as much of it is used as of oil. Less is
                    necessary in summer than in winter. Too much oil hinders the varnish from
                    drying; but when too little is used. It cracks and does not spread properly. We
                    shall subjoin the most useful oil varnishes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">White copal Varnish.</hi> —On sixteen ounces of melted copal
                    pour four, six, or eight ounces of linseed oil, boiled and quite free from
                    grease. When they are well mixed, take them off the fire (not forgetting to stir
                    them properly); and when pretty cool, pour in sixteen ounces of the essence of
                    Venice turpentine. Pass the varnish through a cloth. Amber varnish is made in
                    the same way.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Black Varnish for coaches and Iron Work.—</hi> This varnish is
                    composed of bitumen of Palestine, rosin, and amber, melted separately, and
                    afterwards mixed: the oil is then <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=600" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0600-0562"
                    />added, and afterwards the turpentine, as directed above. The usual proportions
                    are, twelve ounces of amber, two ounces of rosin, two ounces of bitumen, six of
                    oil, and twelve of the essence of turpentine. Golden coloured varnish may be
                    made also by substituting linseed oil for alcohol.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Essential Oil Varnishes.—</hi> The only essential oil varnishes
                    used are for pictures. Picture varnishes should be white, light, and quite
                    transparent, which will preserve the colours without giving them any
                    disagreeable tint; and it should be possible to take them off the picture
                    without injuring it. They are usually made of gum mastich and turpentine
                    dissolved together in some essential oil. The varnish is passed through a cloth,
                    and allowed to clarify. It is applied cold to the picture.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Varnish for Glass in order to preserve it from the rays of the
                        Sun.—</hi> Pulverize a quantity of gum adragant.</p>
                <p>and let it dissolve for twenty-four hours in the white of eggs well beat up; then
                    rub it gently on the glass with a brush.</p>
                <p>Varnishes, before they are used, should be carefully kept from dust, which would
                    spoil them; and they should be kept in a vessel quite clean and dry. When used,
                    they should be lifted lightly with a brush, and spread upon a ground altogether
                    free from dirt and moisture. The substance, after being varnished, should be
                    exposed to the beat of the sun, or placed in a warm room covered with a glass
                    case, to keep out all filth. Oil varnishes require more heat than alcohol
                    varnishes. The varnish should be put on very quickly, making great strokes with
                    the pencil or brush, taking care that these strokes never cross one another; it
                    should be spread equally, and never thicker than a leaf of paper; a second coat
                    should never be put on till the first is quite dry. If the varnish, after being
                    put on, becomes dull and uneven. It must be taken off entirely, and new varnish
                    applied.</p>
                <p>When wainscot is to be varnished. It is first painted of a wooden colour. This
                    colour is made by infusing in water either red or yellow ochre (according to the
                    colour wished for), terra ombria (a kind of ochre) and white lead; into this as
                    much as necessary is put of <hi rend="italic">parchment paste.</hi> Two thin
                    coats of this are to be put on, and, after they are quite dry, the varnish.</p>
                <p>Varnishes are polished with pumice-stone and Tripoli earth. The pumice-stone must
                    be reduced to an impalpable powder, and put upon a piece of serge moistened with
                    water; with this the varnished substance is to be rubbed lightly and equally.
                    The Tripoli must also be reduced to a very fine powder, and put upon a clean
                    woollen cloth moistened with olive oil, with which the polishing is to be
                    performed. The varnish is then to be wiped with soft linen, and, when quite dry,
                    cleaned with starch or Spanish white, and rubbed with the palm of the hand or
                    with a linen cloth.</p>
                <p>To recover colours or varnish, and to take off the dirt and filth which may
                    adhere to them, a ley is used made of potash and the ashes of lees of wine. Take
                    forty-eight ounces of potash, and sixteen of the above mentioned ashes, put them
                    into six quarts of water, and the ley is made. Instead of the ashes an equal
                    quantity of potash would probably do as well. To clean dirty colours, dilute
                    some of this ley with four times its quantity of water, and rub the picture with
                    it; then wash it with river water; and when dry, give it a coat or two of
                    varnish. In order to take off a varnish, wash it with the above mentioned ley,
                    then with water, and then lift it off the substance on which it was with any
                    iron instrument.</p>
