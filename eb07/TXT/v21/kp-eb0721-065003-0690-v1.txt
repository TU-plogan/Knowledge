VILLACH, a circle in the Austrian government of Laibach in Illyria. It is bounded on the north by the Upper Ens, on the east by Klaganfort, on the south by Laibach and Venice, and on the west by Tyrol. It extends over 2200 square miles, and comprehends four cities, eleven market towns, and 1147 villages, with 112,980 inhabitants. It is mostly an alpine district, with lofty mountains covered with snow, but intermixed with valleys of great beauty and fertility, and several picturesque lakes and waterfalls. The chief occupation is mining, by which some little silver and less gold is obtained, but more considerable quantities of lead, copper, antimony, and quicksilver. There are also many valuable quarries, yielding marbles of great beauty. The capital is the city of the same name, on the river Drove. It is well built and strongly fortified, contains two churches, 360 dwelling-houses, and 4820 inhabitants, who are chiefly employed in converting the minerals into common utensils. Lat. 46. 35. Long. 13. 42. E.
