                    ever produced. was born in 1633. He displayed his knowledge of fortification in
                    the course of many sieges, and his services were rewarded with the first
                    military honours. He was made governor of Lisle in 1668, commissary-general of
                    the fortifications of France in 1678, governor of the maritime parts of Flanders
                    in 1689, and a marshal of France in 1703. He died in 1707, after having brought
                    the arts of attacking and defending fortified places to a degree of perfection
                    unknown before. His writings on these subjects are in great esteem.</p>
