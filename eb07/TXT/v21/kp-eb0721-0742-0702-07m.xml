                    Cologne on the 19th of July 1569, was the son of a dyer who had secretly adopted
                    the Protestant faith. Having received a good preliminary education, he in 1587
                    entered the College of St Lawrence at Cologne. After lecturing at Geneva, he was
                    appointed professor of theology at Steinfurt, where he continued till 1610, when
                    he succeeded Arminius in the professorship of theology at Leyden. Here he
                    composed his “Tractatus Theologicus de Deo, sive de Natura et Attributis Dei.”
                    This brought on him the accusation of heresy, and engaged both individuals and
                    universities in the controversy. James the First drew up a large catalogue of
                    the heresies which it contained, and caused the work to be <pb break="no"

                    />burned in London. He moreover informed the States that if they did not dismiss
                    Vorstius, none of his subjects would be permitted to visit Leyden; and such was
                    the odium raised against him from other quarters, that he was ultimately
                    dismissed from his office, and banished, by the States of Holland, from their
                    territory. After spending two years in concealment, frequently changing his
                    abode for fear of his life, he received an asylum from the duke of Holstein, who
                    had assigned to the dispersed followers of Arminius a piece of ground for
                    building a town. He died shortly after at Toningen, on the 29th of September
                    1622, at the age of fifty-three.</p>
