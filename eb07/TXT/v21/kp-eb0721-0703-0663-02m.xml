                <p><label type="entry">VOIGHTLAND</label>, a province or circle of the kingdom of
                    Saxony, which was diminished by the peace of 1814. It is bounded on the
                    north-east by Erzgeberge, on the southeast by Bohemia, on the south-west by
                    Bavaria, and on the north-west by Reus. The province is divided into three
                    bailiwicks, comprehending eighteen cities or towns and 294 villages, with
                    102,890 inhabitants. It is 303 square miles in extent, and occupies the side or
                    the top of a mountainous range. It is a raw and cold district and mostly a
                    stoney soil, and on the higher parts no other corn than oats will ripen. It
                    yields abundance of potatoes, which form the chief sustenance, much fruit, and
                    in some portion tolerable pasture. The woods are extensive and furnish charcoal
                    and some pitch. The chief occupation is in the muslin manufacture, which employs
                    more than 25,000 persons. There are mines of iron and of copper, and the
                    converting those metals into domestic articles affords considerable employment.
                    The capital of the province is the city of Plauen on the river E1ster.</p>
