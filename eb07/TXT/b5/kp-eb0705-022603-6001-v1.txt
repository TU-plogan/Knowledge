BREECHES, a garment worn by males, reaching from the girdle to the knees, and serving to cover the hips, thighs, and knees. The ancient Romans had nothing in their dress answering to our breeches and stockings; instead of which, under their lower tunics and waistcoats, they sometimes bound their thighs and legs round with silken scarfs or fasciae, which were called tibialia and femoralia. Breeches appear to be a habit peculiar to the barbarous nations, especially those inhabiting the colder countries of the north; and hence Tacitus calls them barbarum tegmen. We find mention made of them among the ancient Getae, Sarmatae, Gauls, Germans, and Britons; they also obtained amongst the Medes and Persians, who were of Scythian origin; and they afterwards got footing in Italy, some say as early as the time of Augustus, but without much foundation, since the breeches of that emperor, mentioned by Suetonius, were apparently only swaths tied round his thighs. But however this be, breeches were at last received into Italy, and became so much in fashion, that it was judged necessary, under Arcadius and Honorius, to restrain them by law, and expel the bracarii or brecches-makers out of the city, it being thought unworthy of a nation which commanded the world to wear the apparel of barbarians.
