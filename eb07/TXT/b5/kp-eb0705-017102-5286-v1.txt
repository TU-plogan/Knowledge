BRACKLEY, a borough and market-town of the hundred of Kingâ€™s Sutton, in Northamptonshire, sixty-three miles from London. It had formerly much trade in wool, and some manufactures; but now chiefly depends on the agriculture of its vicinity. It has two churches, a handsome market-house, an endowed free school, and an hospital. The market is held on Wednesday. It returns two members to Parliament, chosen by the corporate body under the influence of the Earl of Bridgewater. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 1495, in 1811 to 1580, and in 1821 to 2236.
