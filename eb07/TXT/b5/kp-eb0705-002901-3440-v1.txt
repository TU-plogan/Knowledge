BOSWORTH-Market, a market-town in the hundred of Sparkenhoe, in the county of Leicester, 107 miles from London. Near it is the celebrated field of the battle between Richard III. and Henry V‚àè., then Duke of Richmond, by which the crown of England was transferred to the latter. The market is held on a Wednesday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 791, in 1811 to 954, and in 1821 to 1117.
