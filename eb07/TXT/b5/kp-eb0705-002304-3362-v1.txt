BOSQUETS, in Gardening, groves so called, from bos-chetto, an Italian word which signifies a little wood. They are compartments in gardens formed by branches of trees disposed either regularly in rows, or wildly and irregularly, according to the fancy of the owner. A bosquet is either a plat of ground inclosed with palisades of hornbeam, the middle filled with tall trees, the tops of which form an umbrageous covering; or it consists only of high trees, as horse-chestnut, elm, and the like.
