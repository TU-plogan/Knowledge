BURFORD, a market-town of the hundred of Bampton, in the county of Oxford, seventy-three miles from London, on the river W indrush. It is celebrated as the place where an ecclesiastical synod was held in 685, to determine on the time for celebrating Easter; for a battle between Cuthred, king of the West Saxons, and Ethelbald, king of the Mercians; and for a victory by Fairfax in 1649 over the army of Charles I. The church is a large and handsome fabric, with a lofty spire. There is very little trade. The market is held on Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 1516, in 1811 to 1342, and in 1821 to 1409.
