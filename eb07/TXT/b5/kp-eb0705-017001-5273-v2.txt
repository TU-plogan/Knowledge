B QUADRO, Quadrato, or Duralx, in Music, called by the French b quarre, from its figure ⅛. This is what we call B natural or sharp, in distinction to B mol or flat. If the flat ♭ be placed before a note in the thorough bass, it intimates that its third is to be minor; and if placed with any cipher over a note in the bass, as ♭ 6, or ♭ 5, it denotes that the fifth or sixth thereto are to be flat. But if the quadro ♯ is be placed over any note, or with a cipher, in the thorough bass, it has the contrary effect; for thereby the note or interval thereto is raised to its natural order.
