BRAINTREE, a market-town in the hundred of Hink-ford and county of Essex, 40 miles from London. It was the first seat of the baize manufacture introduced into England by the Flemings in the reign of Elizabeth, but that trade is nearly altogether removed to the north of England. It is situated in a very beautiful and fertile district, and a silk manufactory has recently been established. There is a market on Wednesdays. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2821, in 1811 to 2298, and in 1821 to 2983.
