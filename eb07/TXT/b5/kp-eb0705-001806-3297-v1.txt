In 1695 he was named one of the committee for foreign affairs under Μ. Torez; and he was afterwards charged with some important transactions in England, Germany, Holland, and Italy.

Bos. See Mammalia, Index.

Bos, in Antiquity, was the name of an ancient Greek silver coin or didrachmus, equivalent to two drachms: it was sometimes also struck of gold. This coin was so called from having on it the impression of an ox. It obtained chiefly among the Athenians and Delians. Hence arose the phrase Bos in lingua, applied to those who had taken bribes to hold their tongue.
