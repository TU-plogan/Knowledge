BOSSO, in Latin Bossus, Matthew, distinguished by his virtue and his learning, was born at Verona in 1428. He devoted himself to the ecclesiastical state in 1451, in the congregation of regular eanons of St John de Lateran, and afterwards taught divinity at Padua. His orations, his sermons, and his letters, have often been printed. He was also the author of a sort of an apology for Phalaris, and other works; and died at Padua in 1502, aged seventy-five. â€™
