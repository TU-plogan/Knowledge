BRASIDAS, a celebrated general of the Lacedemonians about 424 years before the birth of Christ. He defeated the Athenians by land and sea, took many places, and rendered his native country formidable to all the neighbouring states. He repulsed the Athenians in their attempted surprise of Amphipolis, but died of the wounds he received in that battle. See Attica.
