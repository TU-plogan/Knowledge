BUTCHER, a person who slaughters cattle for the use of the table, or who cuts up and retails the same. Among the ancient Romans there were three kinds of established butchers, whose office it was to furnish the city with the necessary cattle, and to take care of preparing and vending their flesh. The suarii provided hogs; the pecuarii or boarii other cattle, especially oxen; and under these was a subordinate class, whose office it was to kill, called lanii and carnifices. ' Butcher-Bird.
