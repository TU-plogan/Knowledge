BRACELET, an ornament worn on the wrist, and much used among the ancients. It was made of different materials, and in different fashions, according to the age and quality of the wearer. The word is French, bracelet; which Menage derives further from braceletum, a diminutive of bracile, a word occurring in writers of the age of Justinian; all formed from the Latin brachium, an arm. It amounts to the same with what was called by the ancients armillÎ±, brachiale, occabus ; and in the middle ages boga, bauga, armispatha.
