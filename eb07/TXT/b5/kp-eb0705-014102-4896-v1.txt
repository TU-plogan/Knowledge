BOTANOMANCY (from β οτavη, an herb, and μαντεία, divination}, an ancient species of divination, by means of plants, especially of sage and fig leaves. The manner of performing it was this: The persons who consulted wrote their own names and their questions on leaves, which were exposed to the wind; and as many of the letters as remained in their own places were taken up, joined together, and considered as an answer to the question.
