BUNEL, Peter, one of the most elegant writers of his time, was born at Toulouse in 1499, and died at Turin in 1547. He left behind him some Latin epistles, Epistolae Ciceroniano Stylo Scriptae, remarkable for the elegance and purity with which they are written. Bunel, says Bayle, “was an honest man, the very person whom Diogenes wanted. His letters are written with the greatest purity, and contain curious facts.” The most correct edition is that of Graverol, Toulouse, 1687, 8vo.
