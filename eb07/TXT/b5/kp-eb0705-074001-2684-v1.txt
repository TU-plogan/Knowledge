BURNISHER, a round polished piece of steel, serving to smooth and give a lustre to metals. Of these there are different kinds, of different figures, straight, crooked, and the like. Half burnishers are used to solder silver, as well as to give it a lustre. Burnishers for gold and silver are commonly made of a dog’s or wolf’s tooth, set in the end of an iron or wooden handle. Of late agates and pebbles have been introduced, which many prefer to the dog’s tooth. The burnishers used by engravers in copper, usually serve with one end to burnish, and with the other to scrape.

- BURNISHING, the art of smoothing or polishing a metalline body, by a brisk rubbing of it with a burnisher.
