BOUKA, or Lord Anson’s Island, in the South Pacific Ocean, lying south of Bougainville’s Island, is covered with wood from the shore to the centre, which is of considerable height. Along the beach are extensive plantations of cocoa-nut trees. Their canoes are ingeniously constructed; and they are remarkably dexterous in the use of the bow and arrow, bringing down birds on the wing with almost unerring certainty. Long, of the north cape, 153. 34. E. Lat. 5. 0. S.
