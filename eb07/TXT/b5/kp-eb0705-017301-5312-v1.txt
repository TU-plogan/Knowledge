BRADNINCH, a town of the hundred of Hayridge, in the county of Devon, 170 miles from London, and six from Exeter. It is a poor manufacturing place, but has a corporation, and formerly returned two members to Parliament; but the inhabitants were relieved from the expense on the plea of poverty, on payment of five marks, in the reign of Henry VII. The inhabitants in 1801 amounted to 1187, in 1811 to 1321, and in 1821 to 1511.
