BRANCHIDAe, in Grecian Antiquity, priests of the temple of Apollo, at Didymus, in Ionia. They opened to Xerxes the temple of Apollo, and suffered him to carry away the riches; after which, thinking it unsafe to stay longer in Greece, they fled to Sogdiana, upon the frontiers of Persia, where they built a city called by their own name. But they did not escape the punishment of their crime; for on the conquest of Darius, Alexander the Great, informed of their treachery, put them all to the sword, and razed their city, thus summarily visiting the impiety of the fathers upon their posterity.
