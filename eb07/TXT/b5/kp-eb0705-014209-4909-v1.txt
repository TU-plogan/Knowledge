BOUCHE of Court, the privilege of having meat and drink at court scot-free. This privilege is sometimes only extended to bread, beer, and wine. It was a custom anciently in use, as well in the houses of noblemen as in the kingâ€™s court. Thomas earl of Lancaster retained Sir John de Ewre to serve him with ten men at arms in time of war, allowing them bouche of court, with livery of hay and oats, horse-shoes and nails. Sir Hugh Merril had the same privilege for life, on condition of serving King Edward II.
