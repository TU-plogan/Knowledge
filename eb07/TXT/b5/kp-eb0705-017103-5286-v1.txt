BRACTON, Henry, Lord Chief Justice of England in the reign of Henry HI., was probably a native of Devonshire. He was educated at Oxford, where he took the degree of doctor of laws, and was made one of the itinerant judges about the year 1244. Ten years after he became chief justice, and had the Earl of Derbyâ€™s house in London assigned him for his town residence during the minority of that nobleman. He is said to have filled this important office with singular reputation during twenty years. The time of his death is not known; probably it occurred in the reign of Edward I. He wrote De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae, which is one of the most ancient and most methodical books on the laws of England. His method is copied from that of Justinian. This work was printed at London in 1569, folio; and in 1640, in 4to.
