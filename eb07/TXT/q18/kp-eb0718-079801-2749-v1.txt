QUOIN, or Coin, on board a ship, a wedge fastened on the deck close to the breech of the carriage of a gun, to keep it firm up to the shipâ€™s side. Cantic quoins are short, three-legged quoins put between casks to keep them steady.

Quoins, in Architecture, denote the corners of brick or stone walls. The word is particularly used for the stones in the corners of brick buildings. When these stand out beyond the brick-work, their edges being chamfred off, they are called rustic quoins.
