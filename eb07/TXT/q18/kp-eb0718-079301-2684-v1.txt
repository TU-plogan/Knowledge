QUIMPER, an arrondissement of the department of Finisterre, in France. It is six hundred and forty-one square miles in extent, is composed of nine cantons, divided into sixty-five communes, and contains 82,800 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name. It is on the acclivity of a hill, about ten miles from the sea, at the junction of the rivers Odet and Benaud. The harbour is accessible for vessels of two hundred tons burden, and in the road of Be-naudet the largest ship can ride in security. It is the see of a bishop, and contains a cathedral, four other churches, 1010 houses, with 6750 inhabitants, who carry on a considerable coasting trade and some fisheries. Near this place an attempt was made to land a body of royalists under Pnysaye during the revolution, but it totally failed, and the greater part of them were executed. This was the birthplace of the celebrated Hardouin. Long. 4.12. 30. W. Lat. 47. 58. 24. N.
