QUARRY, a place under ground, from which are extracted marble, freestone, slate, limestone, or other matters proper for building.

Quarry, or Quarrel, amongst glaziers, means a pane of glass cut in the form of a diamond.

Quarries are of two kinds, square and long, each of which is of a different size, and expressed by the number of the pieces that make a foot of glass, viz. eighths, tenths, eighteenths, and twentieths; but all the sizes are cut to the same angles, the acute angle in the square quarrels being 77° 19', and in the long ones 67° 21 z .

Quarry, amongst hunters, is sometimes used for a part of the entrails of the beast taken, which is given by way of reward to the hounds.

Quarry, in falconry, is the game which the hawk is in pursuit of, or has killed.
