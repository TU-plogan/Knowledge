QUADRANT, in Geometry, the arch of a circle, containing ninety degrees, or the fourth part of the entire periphery.

Quadrant also denotes a mathematical instrument, of great use in astronomy and navigation, for taking the altitudes of the sun and stars, as also for taking angles in surveying.

This instrument is variously contrived, and furnished with different apparatus, according to the various uses it is intended for; but they all have this in common, that they consist of a quarter of a circle, the limb of which is divided into ninety degrees. Some have a plummet suspended from the centre, and are furnished with sights to look through.

The principal and most useful quadrants are the common surveying quadrant, astronomical quadrant, Adams’s quadrant, Cole’s quadrant, Gunter’s quadrant, Hadley’s quadrant, horodictieal quadrant, Sutton’s or Collins’s quadrant, and the sinieal quadrant. See Sextant.
