QUIBERON, a market-town of France, in the department of Morbihan, and arrondissement of L’Orient. It is situated on a peninsula, in a bay of the same name, and contains 1850 inhabitants. It is defended by the fort Pen-thièvre, on the same peninsula, and is remarkable for the unsuccessful attempt made in 1795, by a body of royalist emigrants, under the brave Sombreuil.
