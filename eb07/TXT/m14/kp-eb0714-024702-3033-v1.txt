MARIA’S Islands, three small islands in the North Pacific Ocean, occupying a space of about forty-two miles. These islands were first visited by Vancouver. Long, of the anchoring place, 253. 45. E. Lat. 21. 28. N.

Marias las très, three small islands lying off the shore of the intendancy of Guadalaxara, in Mexico. Wood, water, salt-pits, and game abound, and this causes them to be frequented by the English and American whale-ships. The Spaniards likewise visit them for the purpose of obtaining the flax andlignum-vitae which they produce. The south cape of the most easterly of these islands is in longitude 106. 17. west, and latitude 21. 16. north.
