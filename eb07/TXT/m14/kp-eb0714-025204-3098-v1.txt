MARLOW, Great, a town of the county of Buckingham, in the hundred of Desborough, thirty-one miles from London. It is pleasantly situated on the banks of the Thames, over which a fine stone bridge has been recently erected. Near to it are some very extensive copper works, and in the town are some manufactories of lace; and on the Lodden, between this place and Wycombe, arc several paper mills. It is a borough, which did and still continues to elect two members to the House of Commons. The market is held on Saturday. The population amounted in 1801 to 3236, in 1811 to 3963, in 1821 to 3763, and in 1831 to 4237.
