MAHABALIPURAM, a town of Hindustan, in Southern[7:14:25] India, in the province of the Carnatic. It is noted for the celebrated ruins of ancient Hindu temples in the vicinity, dedicated to Vishnu, generally called the Seven Pagodas, though it is not known for what reason, as no such number exists here. There is a high rock, or rather a hill, of stone, about 100 yards from the sea, covered with images, so thickly scattered as to convey the idea of a petrified town. On this hill a temple is cut out of the solid rock, with figures of idols cut in alto relievo on the walls, and well finished. On an adjoining hill there is a gigantic statue of Vishnu asleep on a bed, with a huge snake wound round in many coils as a pillow, the whole cut out of one solid stone. A mile and a half to the southward of the hill are two pagodas, about thirty feet long by twenty wide. Near to these is the figure of an elephant as large as life, and of a lion much larger than life. There are here also other pagodas, and curious monuments of superstition. This town is said to have extended many miles to the eastward, into what is now covered by the sea; and there is every reason to believe that it was formerly a very large city. Long. 78. 18. E. Lat. 12.23. N.
