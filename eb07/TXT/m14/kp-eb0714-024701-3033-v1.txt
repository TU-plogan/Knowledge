MARIANNA, a city of Brazil, in the province of Minas Geraes. It was originally only an arraial or station, but in 1711 John V. raised it to the rank of a town, as a reward for its loyalty, and conferred on it the title of loyal town of Cav∙ino. In 1745 the same monarch created it an episcopal city, and gave it the name of his queen, which it now bears. Since that time it has been the residence of the bishop and chapter of Minas Geraes. It is beautifully situated on a plain, and is surrounded by hills, on which are erected several churches. The city is nearly square, and consists of two well-paved streets, regularly laid out, and conducting to a sort of square. The houses, amounting to 500, have a cleanly look, which arises from their being regularly whitewashed. The churches are neatly built, and amongst them is a spacious cathedral, which enjoys high ecclesiastical as well as civil privileges. There is an ample supply of water, which is advantageous to the numerous gardens with which the houses are interspersed. There are here a Carmelite and a Franciscan convent, and a theological seminary, at which most of the clergy of Minas are educated. The chapter is composed of fourteen canons, with twelve chaplains and four choristers. The diocese of the bishop does not extend over the whole province, several of the more northern districts being within the archiépiscopal see of Bahia. On account of the lofty eminences which surround this city, the air is close and hot, and the climate is consequently somewhat unhealthy. The population may amount to about 5000.
