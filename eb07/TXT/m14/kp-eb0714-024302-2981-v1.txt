MARCH (Martius'), the third month of the year, according to the common way of computing. Amongst the Romans, March was the first month; and in some ecclesiastical computations that order is still preserved, particularly in reckoning the number of years from the incarnation of our Savour; that is, from the 25th of March.
[7:14:244]

March, a market-town of the Isle of Ely, in the county of Cambridge, eighty-one miles from London. It stands on the river Nen, which is navigable, in a rich but marshy situation, resembling the provinces of Holland in the numerous wind-mills by which the water is abstracted from the land. There is a good market, which is held on Friday. The population amounted in 1801 to 2514, in 1811 to 3098, in 1821 to 3850, in 1831 to 5117.
