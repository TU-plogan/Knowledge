MESSENA, or Messene, an inland town, the capital of Messenia, a country of Peloponnesus, erroneously placed by Ptolemy on the coast. It was built by Epaminondas, who recalled all the Messenian exiles, and gave to the town the name of Messene, a place vying in point of strength and situation with Corinth; and hence Demetrius Phalereus advised Philip, father of Perseus, if he wanted to have the Peloponnesus in his power, to make himself master of these two towns, and thus he would have the ox by both horns.
