MARCOMANNI, an ancient people of Germany, who seem to have taken their name from their situation on the limits or marches to the east of the Higher Rhine, and to the north of the Danube. Cluverius allots to them the duchy of Wurtemberg, part of the palatinate between, the Rhine and the Neckar, the Brisgau, and that part of Suabia [7:14:245] situated between the springs of the Danube and the river Bregentz. They afterwards removed to the country of the Boii, whom they expelled and forced to withdraw more to the eastward, occupying what is now called Bohemia.
