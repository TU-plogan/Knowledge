MARKIRCH, or, as it is sometimes called, St Maria aux Mines, is a city of the department of the Upper Rhine, in the arrondissement of Colmar, in France. It is divided into two parts by the river Leber, in one of which the French language is spoken, and in the other the German. It is a place of great manufacturing industry, and fabricates much cotton goods, many thin woollens, and much hosiery. It contains 1050 houses and 8200 inhabitants. Some mines, which formerly yielded silver to the amount of 16,000 ounces annually, besides lead and copper, are now closed. Long. 7. 17. Ä½. Lat. 48. 16. N.
