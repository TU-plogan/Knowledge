MATRONALIA, a Roman festival instituted by Romulus, and celebrated on the kalends of March, in honour of Mars. It was particularly observed by matrons, and bachelors were entirely excluded from any share in the solemnity. During this festival the men sent presents to the women, for which a return was made by .them at the Saturnalia, and the women now gave the same indulgence to their servants which the men gave to theirs at the feast of Saturn, serving them at table, and treating them as superiors.
