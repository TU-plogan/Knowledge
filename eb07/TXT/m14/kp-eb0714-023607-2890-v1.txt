MANTINEA, in Ancient Geography, a town situated in the south of Arcadia, on the confines of Laconia, and afterwards called Antigonea, in honour of King Antigonus. It is memorable for a battle fought in its neighbourhood, between the Thebans and Spartans, in which the latter were completely defeated, but with the loss, however, to the Thebans, of their celebrated commander Epaminondas.
