MATURA, a town and fortress situated near the southern extremity of Ceylon. The surrounding country is covered with long grass and wood, and is the resort of savages and wild animals; but it is valuable from the abundance of elephants which are found here, and which are esteemed equal, if not superior, to any in India. In the vicinity of the town is a celebrated temple of Buddh.
