MERETRIX, amongst the Romans, differed from prostibula. The prostibulae were common courtesans, with bills over their doors, signifying their profession, and were ready at all times to entertain customers; the meretrices entertained none but at night. The meretrices differed in their dress from the matrons. The former wore the toga and short tunics, like those of the men; the latter wore the palla and the stola of such a length as to reach to their feet.
