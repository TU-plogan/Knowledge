MARBLING, the method of preparing and colouring marbled paper. There are several kinds of marbled paper, but the principal difference between them consists in the forms in which the colours are laid on the ground; some being disposed in whirls or circumvolutions, others in jagged lengths, and others only in spots of a roundish or oval figure. The general manner of managing each kind is, nevertheless, the same; namely, the dipping the paper in a solution of gum-tragacanth, or, as it is commonly called, gum-dragon, over which the colours, previously prepared with ox-gall and spirit of wine, are first spread.
