MEGARIS, in Ancient Geography, the country of the Megarians, is described as a rugged region, like Attica; the mountain called Oneian or Asinine, now Maeriplayi or the l√∂ng mountain, extending through it towards Boeotia and Mount Cithaeron. It belonged to Ionia or Attica, until it was taken by the Peloponnesians in the reign of Codrus, when a colony of Dorians settled in it. This territory had Attica to the east, Boeotia to the north and west, and the isthmus of Corinth to the south.
