MARQUE, or Letters of Marque, in war, are letters of reprisal, granting the subjects of one prince or state liberty to make reprisals on those of another. They are so called from the German marche, limit, frontier, as being jus concessum in alterius principis marchas seu limites transeundi, sibique jus faciendi, or a right of passing the limits or frontiers of another prince, and doing oneâ€™s self justice.
