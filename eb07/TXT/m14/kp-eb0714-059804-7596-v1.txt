META, in the Roman circus, was a pile of stones of a pyramidical form, intended as the boundary of the stadium, or chariot course. When the meta had been passed the seventh time, the race was concluded. The greatest art and management were required in avoiding the meta, and yet going as near it as possible. If they went too near, they were in the greatest danger of breaking the-chariot to pieces; and if they took too large a circuit in the turn, they gave their rivals an opportunity of getting within them, besides losing a great deal of ground. The metae at Rome were first of wood, and afterwards of stone; but the emperor Claudius made them of gold, or rather gilded them. In the Roman circus there were two metae, one at the entrance of the course, and the other at the end of it. An egg was placed upon the top of each of the metae.
