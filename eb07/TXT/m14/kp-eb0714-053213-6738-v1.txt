MEGALESIA, and Megalenses Ludi, feasts and games celebrated by the Romans in honour of Cybele or Rhea, the mother of the gods, on the 12th of April, and famous for great rejoicings and diversions of various sorts. The Galli carried the image of the goddess along the eity, with the sound of drums and other music, in imitation of the noise which [7:14:533] they made to prevent Saturn from hearing the cries of his infant son Jupiter, when he was disposed to devour him.
