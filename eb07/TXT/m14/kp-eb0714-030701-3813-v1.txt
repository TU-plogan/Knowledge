MASSAGETAe, an ancient people, about whose original seat there is as much doubt as about that of the Amazons. Tibullus and Ammianus place them near Albania, beyond the Araxes, which sometimes denotes the Oxus; and it is probable they dwelt to the east of Sogdiana. (Dionysius Periegetes, Herodotus, Arrian).
