MAILCOTTA, a town of Hindustan, in the Mysore rajahâ€™s territories, situated upon a rocky elevation, commanding a view of the valley watered by the Cavery. It is one of the most celebrated places of Hindu worship. The large temple is a square building of great dimensions, entirely surrounded by a colonnade, though a mean piece of architecture. There are about 400 houses in the town, occupied by Brahmins.
