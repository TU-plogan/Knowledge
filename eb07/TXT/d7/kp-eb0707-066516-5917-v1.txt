DECURIO, a subaltern officer in the Roman armies. He commanded a decuria, which consisted of ten men, and was the third part of a turma, or the thirtieth part of a legion of horse, which was composed of 580 men. There were certain magistrates in the provinces, called decuriones municipales, who represented the Roman senate in free and corporate towns. As the name implies, they consisted of ten; and their duty was to watch over the interests of their fellow citizens, and to increase the revenues of the commonwealth. Their court was called curia decurionum [7:7:666] and minor senatus ; and their decrees, called decreta decurionum., were marked with two D’s at the top. They generally styled themselves civitatum patres curiales, and honorati municipiorum senatorum. They were elected with the same ceremonies as the Roman senators; they required to be at least tιventy-fivc years of age, and to be possessed of a certain sum of money. The election took place in the kalends of March.
