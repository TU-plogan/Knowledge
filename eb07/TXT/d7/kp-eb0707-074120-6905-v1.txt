DETMOLD, a small city, the capital of the dominions of the prince of Lippe-Detmold. It is situated on the river Werra, is surrounded with walls, and divided into the old and new town. From being the seat of the government, it supports, with little or no commerce, a population of about 2300 persons. As there is a court of appeal held here for districts belonging to other states, employment is afforded for numbers of the legal profession.
