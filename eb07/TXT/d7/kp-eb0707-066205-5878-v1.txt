DECIDUOUS, an appellation chiefly used in respect of plants; thus the calyx or cup of a flower is said to be deciduous when it falls along with the flower-petals; and, on the contrary, it is called permanent when it remains after they have fallen. Again, deciduous leaves are those which fall in autumn, in contradistinction to those of the evergreens, which remain all the winter.
