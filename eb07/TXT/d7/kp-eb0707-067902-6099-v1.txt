DEJANIRA, in fabulous history, daughter of Oeneus, King of Aetolia, and wife of Hercules. The centaur Nessus having endeavoured to ravish her, was slain by Hercules with a poisoned arrow. Nessus, when dying, gave his bloody tunic to Dejanira, assuring her that it was a sovereign remedy to cure her husband if ever he proved unfaithful. Some time afterwards, Dejanira thinking she had reason to suspect his fidelity, sent him the tunic, which he had no sooner put on than he was seized with the most excruciating torments. Being unable to support his pains, he retired to Mount Oeta, and erecting a pile of wood, set fire to it, and threw himself into the flames, upon which Dejanira killed herself in despair.
