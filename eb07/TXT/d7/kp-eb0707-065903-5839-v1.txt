DEALPOOR, a district of Hindustan, in the province [7:7:660] of Moultan, and situated about the thirty-first degree of north latitude. It is annually overflowed by the waters of the rivers Beyah and Suttledge, and is famous for its pastures, on which are reared not only fine cattle, but an excellent breed of horses, from which the British cavalry are recruited. The chief town is Dcbalpoor. This country now belongs to the Sikks.
