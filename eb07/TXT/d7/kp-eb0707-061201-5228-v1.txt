DAMSEL, from the French demoiselle, an appellation anciently given to all young people of either scx, that were of noble or genteel extraction, as the sons and daughters of princes, knights, and barons; thus we read of Damsel Pcpin, Damsel Louis le Gros, Damsel Richard Prince of Wales. From the sons of kings this appellation first passed to those of great lords and barons, and at length to those of gentlemen who were not yet knights.
