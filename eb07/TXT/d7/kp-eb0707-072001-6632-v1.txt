DENIZEN, in Law, an alien made a subject by the king’s letters patent; otherwise called donaison, because his legitimation proceeds ex donatione regis, “ from the king’s gift.”

À denizen is a kind of middle state between an alien and a natural-born subject, and partakes of both. He may take lands by purchase or devise, which an alien may not; but he cannot take by inheritance, for his parent, through whom, he must claim, being an alien, had no inheritable blood, and therefore could convey none to the son; and, upon a like defect of blood, the issue of a denizen born before denization cannot inherit, but his issue born after may. A denizen is not excused from paying the alien’s duty, and some other mercantile burdens. No denizen can be of the privy-council, or either house of parliament, or hold any office of trust, civil or military, or receive any grant of lands, &c. from the crown.
