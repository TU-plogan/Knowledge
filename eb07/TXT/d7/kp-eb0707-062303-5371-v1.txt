DARABJIRB, or Darab-guierd, a town of Persia, in the province of Kerman, situated on the banks of a river which runs through an extensive plain, interspersed with villages and cultivated lands. It is surrounded with groves of orange and lemon trees, which yield fruit in such abundance that the juice is exported to all parts of Persia. Although a great part of the town is in ruins, it still contains from 15,000 to 20,000 inhabitants. It was formerly a celebrated place, being founded about 400 years before the v Christian era, according to the Persian historians, by King Darab, supposed to be the same as the Darius Nothus of the Greek and Roman authors.
