DEANERY, is the office of a dean. Deaneries and prebends may become void like a bishopric, by death, by deprivation, or by resignation either to the king or bishop. If a dean, prebendary, or other spiritual person, be made a bishop, all the preferments of which he was before possessed become void; and the king may present to them in right of his royal prerogative. They are not void by the election, however, but only by the consecration.
