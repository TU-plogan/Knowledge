DALECHAMP, James, a French physician and botanist, was born at Caen, in Normandy, in 1513. He was distinguished for his industry and erudition, both in science and in literature. He wrote notes on Plinyâ€™s Natural History, and translated Athenaeus into Latin. He added thirty plates of rare plants to the Dioscorides of Ruellius, printed in 1552; and after his death appeared his Historia generalis Plantarum, in libros xviii. per certas classes artificiose digesta, Lugd. 1587, two vols, folio. In this work, which is said to have been the labour of thirty years, the author proposed to include all the botanical discoveries previously to his own time, as well as those which he had made himself in the vicinity of Lyons and the Alps. He also published editions of Paulus Aegineta, and Caelius Aurelianus, with notes; besides a work on surgery, and another De Peste, in three books. He practised physic at Lyons from 1552 to 1558, when he died, at the advanced age of seventy-five.
