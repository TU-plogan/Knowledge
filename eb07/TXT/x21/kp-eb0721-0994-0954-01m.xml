                <p><label type="entry">XENOPHANES</label>, the founder of the Eleaic sect of
                    philosophy among the Greeks, was born at Colophon, probably about the
                    sixty-fifth Olympiad. From some cause or other he left his country early, and
                    took refuge in Sicily, where he supported himself by reciting, in the court of
                    Hiero, elegiac and iambic verses, which he had written in reprehension of the
                    theogonies of Hesiod and Homer. From Sicily he passed over into Magna Graecia,
                    where he took up the profession of philosophy, and became a celebrated preceptor
                    in the Pythagorean school. Indulging, however, a greater freedom of thought than
                    was usual among the disciples of Pythagoras, he ventured to introduce new
                    opinions of his own, and in many particulars to oppose the doctrines of
                    Epimenides, Thales, and Pythagoras. Xenophanes possessed the Pythagorean chair
                    of philosophy about seventy years, and lived to the extreme age of 100 years,
                    that is, according to Eusebius, till the eighty-first Olympiad. The doctrine of
                    Xenophanes concerning nature is so imperfectly preserved, and obscurely
                    expressed, that it is no wonder that it has been differently represented by
                    different writers. Perhaps the truth is, that he held the universe to be one in
                    nature and substance, but distinguished in his conception between the matter of
                    which all things consist, and that latent divine force which, though not a
                    distinct substance, but an attribute, is necessarily inherent in the universe,
                    and is the cause of all its perfection.</p>
