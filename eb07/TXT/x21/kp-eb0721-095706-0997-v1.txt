XYSTUS, among the Greeks, was a long portico, open or covered at the top, where the athlete practised wrestling and running. The gladiators who practised in it were called xystici. Among the Romans, the xystus was only an alley, or double row of trees, meeting like an arbour, and forming a shade to walk under.
