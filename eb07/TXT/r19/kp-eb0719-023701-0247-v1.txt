RICHELET Caesar Peter, a French writer, born in 1631, at Chemin in Champagne, was the friend of Patru and Albancourt; and like them applied himself to the study of the French language with success. He compiled a dictionary of that language, full of new and useful remarks; but exceptionable, as containing many satirical reflections and obscenities. The best edition is that of Lyon, 1728, three volumes folio. He also collected a small dictionary of rhymes, and composed some other pieces in the grammatical and critical department. He died in 1698.
