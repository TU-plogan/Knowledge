RATEEN or Ratten, in commerce, a thick woollen stuff, quilled, and woven in a loom with four treddles, like serges and other stuffs that have the whale or quilling. There are some rateens dressed and prepared like cloths; others left simply in the hair, and others where the hair or knap is frized. Rateens are chiefly manufactured in France, Holland, and Italy, and are mostly used in linings. The frize is a sort of coarse rateen, and the drugget is a rateen half linen half woollen.
