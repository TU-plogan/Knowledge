RABIRIUS, C., a Roman knight, who lent an immense sum of money to Ptolemy Auletes, king of Egypt. The monarch afterwards not only refused to repay him, but even confined him, and endangered his life. Rabirius escaped with difficulty from Egypt; and at his return to Rome he was accused by the senate of having lent money to an African prince for unlawful purposes. He was ably defended by Cicero, and acquitted with difficulty.

In the age of Augustus, there was a Latin poet of the same name, who wrote a poem on the victory which the emperor had gained over Antony at Actium. Seneca has compared him to Virgil for elegance and majesty; but Quintilian is not so favourable in judging his poetry.
