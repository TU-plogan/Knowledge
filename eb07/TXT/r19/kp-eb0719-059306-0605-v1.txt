RYE a borough and seaport of the county of Sussex, in the hundred of Gostrow and rape of Hastings, 63 miles from London. It is a member of the Cinque Ports, but of a later date than the others. The harbour has been nearly choked up, partly by the recession of the sea, though it has been recently somewhat improved by a new cut. It was once fortified, but is ill built. It has a corporation, and returned two members to the House of Commons till 1832, since which it elects but one; and its corporation, by the late law, consists of a mayor, four aldermen, and eleven councillors, but no justice of the peace. It has markets, which are held on Wednesday and Friday. The population amounted in 1821 to 3599, and in 1831 to 3715.
