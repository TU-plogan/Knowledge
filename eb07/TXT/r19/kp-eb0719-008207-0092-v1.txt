RECOIL or Rebound, the starting backwards of a firearm after an explosion. Mersenne tells us, that a cannon twelve feet in length, weighing 6400lbs. gives a ball of 24lbs. an uniform velocity of 640 feet per second. Putting, therefore, W = 6400, ia = 14, V = 640, and ν = the velocity with which the cannon recoils; because the momentums of the cannon and ball are equal, we shall have W v — w tv V 24* x 64?

V; and so v = - ξγ^- ' = 2∙4; that is, it would recoil at the rate of 2 1 ⅞ feet per second, if free to move.
