ROMANIA or Rumelia, an extensive province of the Turkish empire in Europe, called by the Turks the Ejelat Rumili, or the land of the Romans. In the more extended sense it comprehends the whole countries to the west and the north of the Bosphorus, but in a more peculiar sense it included the ancient Thrace; Bulgaria, Servia, and Greece, except a strip on the coast and the islands which are in the Pashalic of the Capudan Pascha, and one distinguished as the Ejalet Dscheseir. It is divided into 24 districts or sand-giacets, extends over 105,182 square miles, and probably contains 6,000,000 inhabitants. The capital of it, as of the empire, is Constantinople or Istambol.
