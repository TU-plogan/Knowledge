ROSAMOND daughter of Walter Lord Clifford, was a young lady of exquisite beauty. The popular story of her is as follows. Henry II. saw her, loved her, declared his passion, and triumphed over her honour. To avoid the jealousy of his queen Elinor, he kept her in a wonderful labyrinth at Woodstock; and by his connection with her had William Longsword earl of Salisbury, and Geoffrey bishop of Lincoln. On Henryâ€™s absence in France, however, on account of a rebellion in that country, the queen found means to discover her; and, though struck with her beauty, she recalled sufficient resentment to poison her. The queen, it is said, discovered her apartment by a thread of silk; but how she came by it is differently related. This popular story is not however supported by history. She was buried in the church of Godstow, opposite to the high altar, where her body remained till it was ordered to be removed with every mark of disgrace by Hugh bishop of Lincoln in 1191. She was, however, considered as a saint after her death.
