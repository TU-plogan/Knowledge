RIPLEY a market-town of the west riding of the county of York, 215 miles from London and four from Knaresborough, in the wapentake of Claro. It is situated on the river Nyd, over which is a stone bridge. It was formerly a place of some importance, having a large castle, the ruins of which still exist. The church is an ancient building, with many monuments. It is remarkable from the extensive cultivation of liquorice. The market is on Friday, but has been but little attended of late years. The population amounted in 1801 to 892, in 1811 to 880, in 1821 to 1282, and in 1831 to 1219; but in the parish are included other two townships.
