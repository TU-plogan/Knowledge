RECHERCHE Archipelago, agroup of islands stretching about 126 miles along the south coast of New Holland, between the thirty-third and thirty-fourth degrees of south latitude. Several of them are naked rocks; and from the coast of New Holland the access is extremely difficult, owing to the rocks and shoals that are interspersed.
