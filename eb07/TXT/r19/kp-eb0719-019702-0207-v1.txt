RHABDOLOGY or Rabdology, in arithmetic, a name given by Napier of Merchiston, the inventor of logarithms, to a method of performing some of the more difficult operations of numbers by means of square little rods. Upon these are inscribed the simple numbers; then, by shifting them according to certain rules, those operations are performed by simply adding or subtracting the numbers as they stand upon the rods.
