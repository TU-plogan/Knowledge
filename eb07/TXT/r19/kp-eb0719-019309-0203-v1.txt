REUS-PLAUEN two sovereign principalities in Germany, one belonging to the elder and one to the younger branch of that family. The dominions of the elder branch are divided into two portions, of which the northernmost, called the Lordship of Gera, is surrounded by the Prussian province of Saxony, by the duchies of Saxe-Gotha and of Weimar; and the southernmost by Prussia, Weimar, the kingdom of Saxony, Bavaria, and Saxe-Cobourg. It extends over 612 square miles, and contains the capital, Gera, and ten other cities and towns, with 79,370 inhabitants, all of [7:19:194]whom are Protestants, except about 200 Jews. It is an agricultural district, and the character of its soil and productions resembles that of the other parts of Saxony. The dominions of the younger branch consist of several detached lordships, extending over 472 square miles, and contain 52,205 inhabitants, all adhering to the Lutheran profession. The income of these states amounts together to L.54,000. The soil and productions of both are similar. The military contingent required by the German confederation for both the states is 742 men.
