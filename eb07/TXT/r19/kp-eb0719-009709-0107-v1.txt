REGAN a neat little town of Persia, in the province of Kerman, situated in the district of Nurmansheer, on the eastern frontier. The town is surrounded by a mud-wall; the fort is quadrangular, and the walls are high and in good ι epair, being flanked with bastions. The cattle of the inhabitants are driven every night within the walls for protection. A guard is constantly kept at the only gate which the town has, to prevent the entrance of strangers, and also the predatory incursions of the surrounding tribes. It is eighty-nine miles east from Bumm.
