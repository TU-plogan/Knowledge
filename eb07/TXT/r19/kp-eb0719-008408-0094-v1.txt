REDUNDANT in Music. What the French call
[7:19:85]

“une accord superflue,” which we have translated a redundant chord, has by others been rendered a chord extremely sharp, as in the translation of Rameau’s Principles of . Composition. Their nature will be best understood by a few examples, and an account of the number of tones, semitones, or lesser intervals, contained in each.

The second redundant is composed of a major tone and a minor semitone, as from fa to sol sharp. Its proportion is as 64 to 75. The third redundant consists of two tones and a semitone, as fa Ut sharp. Its proportion is as 96 to 125. The fourth redundant is the same with the tritone.

From these examples compared with the same intervals in their natural state, the reader may form a general idea of what is meant by redundant.
