RABBIS or Rabbin, a title which the Pharisees and doctors of the law amongst the Jews assumed, and which literally signifies “masters.” There were several gradations before they arrived at the dignity of rabbin, which was not conferred until they had acquired the profoundest knowledge of the law and the traditions. It does not, however, appear that there was any fixed age or previous examination necessary; but when a man had distinguished himself by his skill in the written and traditional law, and passed through the subordinate degrees, he was saluted as rabbi by the public voice. Amongst the modern Jews, for nearly seven hundred years past, the learned men retain no other title than that of rabbin; they have great respect paid them, and the first places or seats in the synagogues; they determine all matters of controversy, and frequently pronounce upon civil affairs; and they have even power to excommunicate the disobedient.
