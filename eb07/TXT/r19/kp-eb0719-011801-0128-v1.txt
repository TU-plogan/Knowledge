REMUS the brother of Romulus, was exposed, together with his brother, by the cruelty of his grandfather. In the contest which happened between the two brothers about building a city, Romulus obtained the preference; and Remus, for ridiculing the rising walls, was put to death by his brotherâ€™s orders, or by Romulus himself. After this murder the Romans were afflicted with a plague; upon which the oracle w r as consulted, and the manes of Remus w r ere appeased by the institution of the Remuria.
