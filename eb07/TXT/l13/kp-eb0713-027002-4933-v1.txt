LIBERAL ARTS, are such as depend more on the labour of the mind than on that of the body; or, which consist more in speculation than operation, and have a greater regard to enlightened amusement and curiosity than to necessity. The word comes from the Latin liberalis, which amongst the Romans signified a person who was not a slave, and whose will consequently was not checked by the command of any master. The liberal arts, including under this name rhetoric, painting, sculpture, music, and architecture, used formerly to be summed up in the verse,

Lingua, Tropus, Ratio, Numerus, Tonus, Angulus, Astra; and the mechanical arts, which are innumerable, under

Rus, Nemus, Arma, Faber, Vulnera, Lana, Rates.

See the article Arts.
