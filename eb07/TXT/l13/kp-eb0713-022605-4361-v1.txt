LEMON Island, one of the Skelig Islands, situated off the coast of the county of Kerry, in the province of Munster, in Ireland. It is a round rock, always above water, and therefore nowise dangerous to ships. An incredible number of gannets and other birds breed here; and it is remarkable that gannets nestle nowhere on the southern coasts of Ireland except on this rock, though many of them are seen on all parts of the coast upon the wing. There is another rock on the northern coast of Ireland, remarkable for the same peculiarity.
