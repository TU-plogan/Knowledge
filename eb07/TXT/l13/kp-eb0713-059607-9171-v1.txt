LUTETIA Parisiorum, in Ancient Geography, a town of the Parisii, in Gallia Celtica, situated on an island in the Sequana or Seine. It received its name, as some suppose, from the quantity of clay, lutum, which is found in its neighbourhood. Julius Caesar fortified and embellished it, from which circumstance some authors call it Julii Civitas. Julian the Apostate resided there for some time. It is now Paris, the capital of France, being so called from its name Paryis in the lower age.
