LATHREVE, Leidgreve, or Trithengreve, was an officer under the Saxon government, who had authority over a third part of the county, and whose territory was therefore called trithing, otherwise a leid or leithin, in which manner the county of Kent is still divided. As to the jurisdiction of this officer, those matters which could not be determined in the hundred court were thence brought to the trithing, where all the principal men of the three or more hundreds being assembled by the lathreve or trithin-greve, debated and decided it; or if they could not, then the lathreve sent it up to the county court, to be there finally determined.
