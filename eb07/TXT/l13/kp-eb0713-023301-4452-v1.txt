LESBOS, a large island in the Aegcan Sea, on the coast of Aetolia, about 168 miles in circumference. It has been successively called Pelasgia, from the Pelasgi,Ä¼by whom it was first peopled; Macaria, from Macareus, who settled in it; and Lesbos, from the son-in-law and successor of Macareus, who bore the same name. The chief towns of Lesbos were Methymna and Mitylene. It was originally governed by kings, but they were afterwards subjected to the neighbouring powers. The wine which it produced was greatly esteemed by the ancients, and is still held in the .same repute amongst the moderns. The Lesbians were so debauched and dissipated, that the epithet of Lesbian was often employed to signify debauchery and extravagance. Lesbos has given birth to many illustrious persons, such as Arion, Terpander, Sappho, and others.
