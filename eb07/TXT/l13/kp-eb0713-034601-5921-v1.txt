LILYBAeUM, in Ancient Geography, a city of Sicily, situated on the most westerly promontory of the island, and said to have been founded by the Carthaginians on their expulsion from Motya by Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse. It is remarkable for the three sieges it sustained; one by Dionysius the tyrant, another by Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, and the third by the Romans. The first two failed in their attempts, but the Romans with great difficulty made themselves masters of it. No remains of this once stately city are now to be seen, except some aqueducts and temples.
