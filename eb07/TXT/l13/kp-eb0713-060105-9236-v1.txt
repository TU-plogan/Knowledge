LUTTERWORTH, a market-town of the county of Leicester, in the hundred of Guthlaxton, eighty-nine miles from London, and near the ancient Roman Watling Street Road. It is not a place of much trade, but is distinguished as the residence of Wickliffe, the father of English Protestantism, who was priest of this place, and died here in 1387; and his doctrines were condemned by the council of Constance in 1418, in consequence of which his bones were taken from the grave, burned, and thrown into the river, in 1428. The pulpit from which he preached^ is still preserved as a valuable relic. There is [7:13:602] a market which is held on Thursday. The population amounted in 1801 to 1652, in 1811 to 1845, in 1821 to 2102, and in 1831 to 2262.
