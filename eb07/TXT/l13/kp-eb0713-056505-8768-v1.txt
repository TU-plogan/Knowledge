LONTAR Pulo Isle, an island in the Indian Ocean, separated from the peninsula of Malacca by a narrow strait. This and some of the neighbouring islands are inhabited by men whose whole pursuits are on the sea, that being the element from which they derive their whole subsistence. Agriculture is wholly unknown to them, and they are of simple and inoffensive manners.
