LLANBEDER, or LLAMPETER, a market-town of Wales, in the county of Cardigan and hundred of Modwyn, 204 miles from London. It is situated on a fertile vale on the river Teife, over which a bridge, built by the king of that name, gives the town the addition of Pont Stephen. It is an ancient borough, having, with Cardigan, Aberystwith, and Aspar, formerly returned a member to parliament, and by the recent law it enjoys the same privilege. There is a market on Tuesday, and five fairs are held in the course of the year. The population amounted in 1801 to 1037, in 1811 to 750, in 1821 to 937, and in 1831 to 1317.
