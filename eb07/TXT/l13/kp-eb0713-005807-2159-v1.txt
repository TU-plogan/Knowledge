LANGELAND, an island in the Baltic Sea, a portion of the division of Funen, separated from it by a narrow strait, over which there is a ferry. It is about thirty miles in length and four miles and three fourths in medium breadth, and extends over 106 square miles, comprising one city or town, and fourteen parishes, with 12,300 inhabitants. It is merely an agricultural spot, of moderate fertility, yielding a surplus of about 14,000 quarters of corn beyond the consumption of the population. The capital is Rudkiobing, a place of 1200 inhabitants, situated in longitude 10. 42. E. and latitude 54. 55. N.
