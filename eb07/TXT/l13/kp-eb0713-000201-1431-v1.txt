LABARUM, the banner or standard borne before the Roman emperors in the wars. The labarum consisted of a long lance, with a staff on the top, crossing it at right angles, from which hung a rich streamer, of a purple colour, adorned with precious stones. Till the time of Constantine it had an eagle painted on it; but, instead of this, that emperor added a cross, with a cipher expressing the name of Jesus. This standard the Romans i took from the Germans, Dacae, Sarmatae, Pannonians, and other Teutonic tribes, whom they had overcome. The name of labarum was not known before the time of Constantine; but the standard itself, in the form we have described it, except the symbols’of Christianity, was used by all the preceding emperors. Some derive the word from labor, as if this finished their labours; some from sυλαCs∕α, reverence, piety ; others from "kημ‰ικιν, to take; and others from λapυga, spoils.
