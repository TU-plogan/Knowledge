LADOGA, a lake in Russia, situated between the gulfs of Onega and Finland, measuring 150 miles by ninety, and considered as the largest in Europe. Peter the Great cut a canal sixty-seven miles in length from the south-western extremity of the lake, thus opening a communication between it and the Gulf of Finland.
