LIMB, in general, denotes the border or edge of a thing. Thus we say, the limb of a quadrant, of the sun, t of a leaf, and so forth.

Limb, in Anatomy, an appellation given to the extremities of the body, as to the arms and legs.

Limb, Limbus, Limbo, in the church of Rome, is used in two different senses. The limbo of the patriarchs is said to be the place where the patriarchs waited the redemption of mankind, and where they suppose our Saviourâ€™s soul continued from the time of his death till that of his resurrection. The limbs of infants dying without baptism, is a place supposed to be distinct from both heaven and hell; since they hold that children dying innocent of any actual sin, do not deserve hell, and, by reason of their original sin, cannot be admitted into heaven.
