LICENTIATE, one who has obtained the degree of a license. The greater number of the officers of justice in Spain are distinguished by no other title than that of licentiate. In order to pass as licentiate in common law, civil law, and physic, they must have studied seven years, and in divinity ten. Amongst us a licentiate usually means a physician who has a license to practise, granted by the College of Physicians.
