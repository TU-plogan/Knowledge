LICHTENSTEIN, a sovereign principality, one of the smallest in Germany. It is situated on the frontier of Switzerland and the Tyrol, and borders on the Rhine. It is fifty-five square miles in extent, and contains 1207 houses, in two towns and nine villages, with 5800 inhabitants. The revenue is said to be about L.2000 annually; but the prince has other territory, which has been mediatized, the income of which far exceeds that of the independent sovereign state.
