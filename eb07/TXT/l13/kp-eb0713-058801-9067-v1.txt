LUCIANISTS, or Lucanists, a religious sect, so called from Lucianus, or Lucanus, a heretic of the second century, and a disciple of Marcion, whose errors he followed, adding to them some new ones of his own. But Epiphanius says he abandoned Marcion, teaching that people ought not to marry, for fear of enriching the Creator; and yet other authors mention that he held this error in common with Marcion and other Gnostics. He denied the immortality of the soul, asserting that it was material, and consequently dissoluble. There was another sect of Lucianists, who appeared some time after the Arians, and who taught that the Father had always been a father, and that he had the name even before he begot the Son, as having in him the power or faculty of generation. In this manner they accounted for, or rather impugned, the eternity of the Son.
