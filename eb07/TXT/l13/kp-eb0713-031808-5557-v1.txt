LICETUS, a celebrated physician of Italy, was born at Rappollo, in the state of Genoa, in the year 1577. He came into the world in the seventh month; but his father, an ingenious physician, wrapped him up in cotton, and nurtured him so carefully that he lived to be seventy-seven [7:13:319] years of age. He was trained with great care, became a distinguished man in his profession, and was the author of a great number of works, particularly one De Monstris. He was professor of philosophy and physic at Padua, where he died in the year 1655.
