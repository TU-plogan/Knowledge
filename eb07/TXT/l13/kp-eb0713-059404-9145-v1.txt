LUKE, St, the evangelist, and disciple of the apostles, was originally of Antioch, in Syria, and by profession a physician. He particularly attached himself to St Paul, and was his faithful companion in his travels and labours. He went with the apostle to Troas, in Macedonia, about the year 51; he wrote his gospel in Achaia about the year 53; and, ten years after, he compiled the Acts of the Apostles, which contains a history of thirty years. Of all the inspired writers of the New Testament, his works are written in the most elegant Greek. It is believed that St Luke died at Rome, or in Achaia.

Gospel of St Luke, a canonical book of the New Testament. Some think that it was properly St Paul’s Gospel; and that, when the apostle speaks of his gospel, he means what is called St Luke’s. Irenaeus says that St Luke digested into writing what St Paul preached to the Gentiles; and Gregory Nazianzen tells us that St Luke wrote with the assistance of St Paul.

St Luke the Evangelists Day, a festival in the Christian Church, observed on the 18th of October.
