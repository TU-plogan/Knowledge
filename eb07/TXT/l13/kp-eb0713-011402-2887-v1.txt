LARENTINALIA, in Antiquity, a feast held amongst the Romans on the 23d day of December, but ordered to be observed twice a year by Augustus. It was supposed by some to have been instituted in honour of the Lares, but by others, with more probability, in honour of Acca Laurentia, and to have been the same with Laurentalia.
