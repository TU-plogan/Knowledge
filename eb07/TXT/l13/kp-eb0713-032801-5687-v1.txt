LIGATURE, in Surgery, is a cord, band, or string, or the binding any part of the body with a cord, band, fillet, &c. whether of leather, linen, or any other matter. See Surgery. Ligature is also used to signify a kind of bandage or fillet, tied round the neck, arm, leg, or other part of the bodies of men or beasts, to divert or drive off some disease, accident, &c.

Ligature, in the Italian music, signifies a tying or binding together of notes. Hence syncopes are often called ligatures, because they are made by the ligature of many notes. There is another sort of ligatures for breves, when there are many of these on different lines, or on different spaces, to be sung to one syllable.
