LISIEUX, an arrondissement of the department of Calvados, in France, extending over 339 square miles, and inhabited by 69,500 persons. It is divided into five cantons, and these into 142 communes. The capital is the city of that name situated at the junction of the two rivers Toques and Orbec. It was formerly fortified, but the ramparts have been converted into elegant promenades. It contains 1700 houses, and 11,500 inhabitants, who are employed in the woollen manufacture, and also, but to a greater extent, in making linen of a superior quality, known as toiles cretonnes through France. It is particularly celebrated for its bleaching and its dyeing. Long. 0. 10. E. Lat. 49. 11. N.
