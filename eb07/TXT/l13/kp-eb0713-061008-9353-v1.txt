LYMPHATI was a name given by the Romans to such as were seized with madness. It is supposed to be used for Nympha√º, because the ancients imagined that every person who had the misfortune to see a nymph was instantly struck with frenzy. Lymphati may indeed signify madmen, as derived from lympha, water, over which element the nymphs were thought to preside; but z it appears most likely that distracted people were called lymphati, from the circumstance of madmen being affected with the hydrophobia, or dread of water, after the bite of a mad dog; for this peculiarity, in cases of canine madness, was not unknown to the Romans.
