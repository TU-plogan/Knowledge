LIEGNITZ, one of the governments into which the Prussian province of Silesia is divided, comprising the north-western part of Upper Silesia, and a part of Upper Lausatia. It extends over 4158 square miles. It comprises thirty-five cities or walled towns, and 1383 smaller [7:13:321] towns and villages, and 713,362 inhabitants, of whom the Protestants and Catholics are nearly equal in number. The chief products are corn, fruit, and culinary vegetables, with much excellent flax. Of late years there are large flocks of sheep, the fineness of the wool of which has been improved by crosses of the better breeds. The chief industry is spinning. The capital is the city of the same name, situated on the river Katsbach, where the Blackwater falls into that stream. It is surrounded with walls, but for a promenade rather than defence; and has four gates, with an old castle. It contains two Lutheran and four Catholic churches, several hospitals and courts of law, and a gymnasium, with 780 houses, and about 11,500 inhabitants. It is a place of active manufacturing industry, producing cotton goods of various kinds, camlets, serges, and other woollens, leather, Prussian blue, lace, starch, and musical instruments, and has several breweries and distilleries. This place is remarkable for a battle fought in 1760, in which the Austrians were defeated by the Prussians. Long. 16. 7. 1. E. Lat. 51. 12. 30. N.
