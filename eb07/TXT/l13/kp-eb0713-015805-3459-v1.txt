LEAPING, or Vaultiñg, was an exercise much used both amongst the Greeks and Romans. The former called it άλμα., and performed it with weights upon their heads and shoulders. Sometimes they carried the weights in their hands, which were of different figures, but generally oval, and made with holes or covered with thongs, through which the leapers put their fingers. These weights were called aλτr i pς. The contest was who could leap the highest and farthest. The place whence they jumped was called βaτηg, and that to which they leaped t<5κaμμtva, because the ground was there dug up. This exercise was performed in the seme manner by the Romans.
