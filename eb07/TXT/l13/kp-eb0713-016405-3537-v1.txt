LEES, the grossest and most ponderous parts of liquors, which, being separated by fermentation, fall to the bottom. The word comes from the French lie; and that either from lirnus, mud, or from Lyceus, one of the surnames of Bacchus; or, according to Du Cange, from lia, a corrupt Latin word signifying the same thing. The vinegar-makers carry on a great trade in the lees of wine dried and made into cakes, after having squeezed out the remains of the liquor in presses.
