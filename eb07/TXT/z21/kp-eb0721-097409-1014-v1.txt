ZANGUEBAR, a region of Africa, lying on the eastern coast, between three degrees of north latitude, and eighteen south. It includes several petty kingdoms, in which the Portuguese have various settlements. The inhabitants, except those converted by the Portuguese, are all Mahommedans or idolaters; and the latter much the more numerous. The names of the principal territories are, Mombaza, Lamon, Melinda, Quiola, and Mozambique. The Portuguese built several forts in Mombaza and Mozambique, and there settled several colonies.
