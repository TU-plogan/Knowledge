ZAPATA, a kind of feast or ceremony held in Italy in the courts of certain princes, on St Nicholasâ€™s day. People hide presents in the shoes or slippers of those to whom they would do honour, in such a manner as may surprise them on the morrow when they come to dress. This is done in imitation of the practice of St Nicholas, who used in the night-time to throw purses of money in at the windows to furnish marriage-portions to poor maidens.
