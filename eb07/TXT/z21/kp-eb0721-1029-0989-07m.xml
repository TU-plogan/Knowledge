                    miscellaneous Greek writer of considerable note, flourished at Constantinople
                    about the beginning of the twelfth century. Under the emperor Alexius Comnenus,
                    who died in 1118, he rose to the distinction of being nominated great <hi

                                >goυγγάgιος.</hi></p></note> and chief secretary; but after the
                    death of his wife, he retired to a monastery, and there closed his earthly
                    career. His principal work is his X <hi rend="italic">govιχὸν</hi>, or Annals,
                    deduced from the creation of the world to the death of his imperial patron. The
                    earlier portion of it we cannot easily suppose to be very important; but that
                    which relates to the history of the Greek empire is not without a considerable
                    share of historical value. The <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> was
                    published by Wolfius, Basil. 1557, 3 tom. fol. This was succeeded by the
                    valuable edition of Du Cange, Paris. 1686, 2 tom. fol.; which was reprinted in
                    the Venice edition of the Byzantine historians. Zonaras is well known to
                    canonists by his work, “In Canones S. S. Apostolorum et sacrorum Conciliorum
                    Commentarii.” Lut. Paris. 1618, fol. These commentaries are inserted in Bishop
                    Beveridge’s Pandectae. Some of his works, one in verse, may be found in other
                    collections. See particularly Cotelerii “Ecclesiae Graecae Monumenta,” tom. ii.
                    p. 483, tom. iii. p. 465. A publication more interesting to philologers remains
                    to be specified: “Jo. Zonarae et Photii Lexica, ex codicibus manuscriptis nunc
                    primum edita, observationibus illustrata, et indicibus instructa.” Lipsiae,
                    1808, 3 tom. 4to. The first two volumes contain the lexicon of Zonaras edited by
                    Tittmann; the third volume contains that of Photius edited by Hermann. In the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Photius</hi>, this and another important
                    publication have both been overlooked. *** “Φωr∕'ou vo2 ∏αrja⅛ζou <hi
