                <p><label type="entry">ZEPHYRUS</label>, one of the Pagan deities, was represented
                    as the son of Aurora, and the lover of the nymph Chloris according to the
                    Greeks, or of Flora according to the Romans; and as presiding over the growth of
                    fruits and flowers. He is described as giving a refreshing coolness to the air
                    by his soft and agreeable breath, and as moderating the heat of summer by
                    fanning the air with his silken wings. He is depicted under the form of a youth,
                    with a very tender air, with wings resembling those of the butterfly, and with
                    his head crowned with a variety of flowers. As the poets of Greece and Rome
                    lived in a warm climate, they are lavish of their praise of this beneficent
                    deity, and under his name describe the pleasure and advantage which they
                    received from the western breezes.</p>
