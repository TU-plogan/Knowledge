                <p><label type="entry">ZOSIMUS</label>, a historian of Constantinople, who has had
                    various editors, is supposed to have written in the fifth century. He is
                    described as “comes et exadvocatus fisci and from his own work it is evident
                    that he was not a Christian. He wrote the history of the Roman empire from the
                    reign of Augustus to the year 410. The first book contains brief notices of the
                    earlier emperors, ending with Diocletian; but in the other five books his
                    details are more ample. A Latin version of this history was published by
                    Leunclavius in 1576; and in 1581 H. Stephanus added the Greek text of the first
                    two books to his edition of Herodian. All the six books were published by
                    Sylburgius in the third volume of his “Romanae Historiae Scriptores Graeci
                    Minores.” Francof. 1590, fol. This was followed by other editions, of which the
                    best is that of Reitemeier, Lipsiae, 1784, 8vo; Bonnae, 1837, 8vo. The latter
                    impression, forming a volume of Niebuhr’s “Corpus Scriptorum Historiae
                    Byzantinae,” was superintended by Bekker, who has corrected the errors of the
                    former edition, and has omitted such critical notes as he did not approve. In
                    both these impressions, some annotations of Heyne are added to those of
                    Reitemeier.</p>
