ZELLE, a city of the kingdom of Hanover, in the province of LÃ¼neburg, in Germany. It stands on the river Aller, at the point where the Fuse falls into that stream. It is surrounded with walls and ditches, is the seat of the supreme courts of law, and of the Lutheran superintendent general. It has a gymnasium, and several other establishments for education, and contains three Lutheran, one reformed, and one catholic church, 1460 houses, and 10,300 inhabitants, including those of the suburb. There are various manufactures, but mostly on a small scale; but a considerable trade arises from the city being the great thoroughfare for the goods conveyed by waggons between Hamburg, Bremen, and the middle and south of Germany. Adjoining to the city is the ancient palace of the dukes of Zelle. It is not in very good condition, none of the royal family having lived in it since the death of the unfortunate queen of Denmark, Caroline Matilda, who held her court in it till her death. Long. 9. 57. 4. E. Lat. 52. 37. 3. N.
