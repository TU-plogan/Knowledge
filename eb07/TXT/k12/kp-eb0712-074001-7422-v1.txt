KIRTHIPOOR, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Nepaul, and district of Patan. It was formerly the capital of an independent principality, and was at one time said to contain 6000 houses or families within its jurisdiction; but is at present of little consideration. This place was besieged by Purthi Narrain, the Ghoorkali rajah, and taken, in 1768, after a long and obstinate resistance, at which he was so enraged that he ordered the noses and lips of the survivors to be cut off, without exception of age or sex; and, twenty-three years afterwards, the British ambassador at Nepaul found many persons who had outlived this mutilation. It is three miles from Patan. Long. 85. 37. E. Lat. 27. 30. N.
