KABARDA, a territory of Asia, in the Russian government of Caucasus, inhabited by the principal of those nations known under the name of Circassians. The Terek, along the southern bank of which it extends, separates it from the Russian government of Caucasus. It is divided into the Great and Little Kabarda, the frontier of which reaches from the shore of the Caspian to the river Malka, whilst the latter extends thence to the environs of the city of Mosdok. They are both subject to Russia, but they are governed internally by their own princes.
