KILMALLÃœCK, a town of Ireland, in the county of Limerick, which some centuries ago was one of the best-built inland towns of Ireland, and made a conspicuous figure in the annals of Irish warfare. Its former splendour is indicated by ru ns on a pretty large scale; but, of the monasteries, churches, and other buildings, only one street entire remains, inhabited by very poor people. It is situated twenty miles south from Limerick.
