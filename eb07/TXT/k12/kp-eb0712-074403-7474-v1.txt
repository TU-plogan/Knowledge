KLOSTERNEUBURG, a city of Austria, in the province of the Lower Ens. It is situated on the river Danube, and walled; but the fortifications are dilapidated. It is chiefly remarkable from an establishment for education of an ancient date, which is still maintained, consisting of seventeen professors, with a library of 25,000 volumes, and a museum. The houses are 479, with 3400 inhabitants.
