KENTISH Town, a hamlet of the parish of Paneras, in the hundred of Ossulton, in the county of Middlesex. It has of late so much extended its buildings, that it almost forms a suburb to the metropolis. It is finely situated in a valley, beginning between the hills of Hampstead and Highgate; and being deemed a remarkably healthy spot, is much occupied with country residences of persons connected with London; and within the last ten years it has assumed an elegant appearance. There is a chapel of ease, and some dissenting places of worship.
