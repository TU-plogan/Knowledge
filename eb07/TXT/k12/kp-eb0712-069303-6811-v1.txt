KENSINGTON, a large parish, whose boundary joins to London, in the hundred of Ossulton, in the county of Middlesex. It is chiefly remarkable for the royal palace and gardens, the latter of which forms the scene of the recreation of the inhabitants of the metropolis. The palace is an irregular brick building, purchased by William the Third, and by him and his successors enlarged in various styles. Though with little exterior taste, it has good suites of apartments allotted to junior members of the royal family, and to other persons. The gardens have received all the advantages of which their situation is capable, and form a most pleasing promenade. Holland House and other mansions are objects of remark within this parish, as well as the numerous smaller buildings erected within the last twenty years. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 8556, in 1811 to 10,386, in 1821 to 14,428, and in 1831 to 20,902.
