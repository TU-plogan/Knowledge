KONG, a kingdom of Central Africa, to the south of the Niger, nearly midway between Ashantee and Bambarra. According to Park, hong signifies mountain; and the physical aspect of the country corresponds to this, being traversed by a great central chain of mountains bearing the same name. There is little known concerning this kingdom; and it appears to be by no means so wealthy and powerful as that of Ashantee, although the country is populous, and abounds in horses and elephants.
