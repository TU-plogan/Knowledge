KENNINGTON, a hamlet adjoining to London, in the parish of Lambeth, in Surrey, a mile and a half from Westminster Bridge. It is one of those places in the vicinity of the metropolis which of late years have vastly increased in opulence and appearance. Two new churches, and numerous substantial houses, have been built. A palace formerly stood within it, which was inhabited by se veral of our monarchs, the last of whom was Henry the Eighth. It was destroyed in the civil war under Charles the First. A canal has been carried on to this place from the Thames, by which coals and other heavy articles are conveyed to it at a cheap rate.
