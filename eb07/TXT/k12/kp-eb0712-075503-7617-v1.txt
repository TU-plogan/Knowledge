KOLOMEA, a circle of the Austrian kingdom of Galicia, extending over 1263 square miles, and comprehending three cities, twelve market-towns, and 204 villages, containing 30,618 houses, with 156,614 inhabitants, of whom 11,700 are Jews. It is an agricultural district, yielding corn and flax in the level parts; but a large portion of it is mountainous and barren.
