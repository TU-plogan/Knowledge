FAGGOT, in the times of persecution, was a badge worn on the sleeve of the upper garment, by such persons as had recanted or abjured what was then termed heresy. It was put on after the person had carried a faggot, by way of penance, to some appointed place of solemnity. Leaving off wearing this badge was sometimes interpreted as a sign of apostasy.

Faggots, amongst military men, persons hired by officers, whose companies were not full, to muster and conceal the deficiencies of such companies. This disgraceful practice has long ceased in our army.
