FILLET, or Filet. See Architecture, Index. Fillet, in Heraldry, a kind of orle or bordure, containing only a third or fourth part of the breadth of the common bordure. It is supposed to be withdrawn inwards, and is of a different colour from that of the field. It runs quite round, near the edge, as a lacc over a cloak.

Fillet is also used among painters, gilders, and others, for a little rule or reglet of leaf gold, drawn over certain mouldings, or on the edges of frames, pannels, and the like, especially when painted white, by way of enrichment.

Fillets, in the Manege, are the loins of a horse, which begin at the place where the hinder part of the saddle usually rests. . . â€ž
