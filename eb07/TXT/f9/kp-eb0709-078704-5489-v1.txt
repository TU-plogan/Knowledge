FORTUNA, the goddess of fortune, worshipped by the Greeks and Romans, became particularly celebrated after the triumphs of the latter. According to Hesiod, she was the daughter of Oceanus and Tethys, the sister of the Parcae, and the protectress of cities. The sculptor Bupalus represented her with a celestial globe on her head, and a cornucopia in her hand. She had temples in Smyrna, Corinth, and Elis; but it was at Rome where she seems to have been more particularly worshipped, and where she had upwards of twenty shrines erected to her honour. There was a magnificent temple of Fortune at Praeneste, now Palestrina, eighteen miles east from Rome. Here was the celebrated oracle called Sortes Proenestince, where the response was given by means of words written on pieces of wood, which were placed in a box, and having been taken out at random, were then united, when the priest declared the meaning of the answer. The first Mosaic pavement introduced into Italy was ordered by Sylla for this temple; and it is a curious fact that a very fine specimen is still seen at Palestrina, which may possibly be that to which we have alluded.
