FILANDERS, in falconry, a disease in hawks, and some other birds, consisting of filaments or strings of blood coagulated; and occasioned by a violent rupture of a vein, by which the blood extravasated hardens into these figures, and incommodes the reins, hips, and other parts.

Filanders are also worms as small as thread, and about an inch long, which lie wrapt up in a thin skin or net, near the reins of a hawk, apart from either gut or gorge.
