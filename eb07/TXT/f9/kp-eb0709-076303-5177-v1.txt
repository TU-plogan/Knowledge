FORT WILLIAM, a fortress of Scotland, in the county of Inverness. It is situated on the east side of Lochiel, and the south side of the small river Nevis, where it falls into that inlet of the sea, at the distance of sixty-one miles south-west of Inverness, and twenty-nine and a half southwest of Fort Augustus. It is of a triangular form, with two bastions mounting fifteen twelve-pounders. The fort was originally built during the usurpation of Cromwell, by General Monk, and occupied much more ground at that time than it does at present. During the reign of William HI. it was rebuilt on a smaller scale, and received its name in honour of that monarch. In the year 1745 it stood successfully a siege of five weeks, but is by no means a place of great strength. It is now garrisoned by a governor, fort-major, and a company of soldiers.
