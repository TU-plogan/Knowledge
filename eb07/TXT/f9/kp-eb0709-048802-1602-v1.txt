FARNHAM, a market-town at the western end of the county of Surrey, in the hundred of the same name, 41 miles from London, on the road to Portsmouth. The vicinity is chiefly remarkable for the quality of the hops produced, which by their celebrity, and consequently high price, have extended the cultivation very considerably. There is an ancient castle transformed into a palace, the residence of the Bishop of Winchester. The making of worsted hose, which once flourished, has now disappeared. The market is held on Thursday, and the sale of wheat at it is extensive. The population amounted in 1801 to 2508, in 1811 to 2911, in 1821 to 3132, and in 1831 to 3142.
