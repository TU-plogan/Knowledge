FASTOLF, Sir John, a renowned English officer, who served in France under Henry IV., Henry V., and Henry VI., was descended from an ancient family in Norfolk, and was born about the year 1377. He was as much distinguished for his virtue at home, as for his valour abroad; and became no less amiable in his private than he had been admired in his public character. He died in 1457, being then upwards of eighty years of age, as we learn from his contemporary William Caxton, the first English printer. By an unaccountable mistake it has been asserted, that Shakspeareâ€™s Falstaff was drawn in order to ridicule Fastolf; and this circumstance has made judicious biographers the more studious to vindicate his reputation.
