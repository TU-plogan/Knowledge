FACULTY, in Law, a privilege granted to a person, by favour and indlugence, of doing that which by law he ought not to do.

Faculty, in the schools, a term applied to the different members of an university, divided according to the arts and sciences taught there. Thus, in most universities there are four faculties; that of arts, which includes humanity and philosophy; that of theology; that of medicine; and that of law.
