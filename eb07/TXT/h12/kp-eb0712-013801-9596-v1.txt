HYPERMNESTRA, in fabulous history, one of the fifty daughters of Danaus, king of Argos. She alone refused to obey the cruel order which Danaus had given to all his daughters, to murder their husbands the first night of their marriage; and therefore saved the life of Lynceus, after she had made him promise not to violate her virginity. Danaus, enraged at her disobedience, confined her closely in prison, whence Lynceus delivered her some time afterwards.
