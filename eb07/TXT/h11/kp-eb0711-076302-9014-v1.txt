HUTTANY, a town of Hindustan, in the Mahratta territories, and province of Bejapoor. It is large and populous, and has an extensive commerce with Bombay, Surat, Rachore, &c. It possesses a small stone citadel, and is enclosed with a rampart and a ditch. It has also a large and excellent place of accommodation for travellers, built of free stone, which is capable of lodging 500 travellers. It formerly belonged to the Mahommedan king of Bejapoor, but was taken by the Mahrattas about the middle of the seventeenth century. It was retaken by the Mahommedans in 1679, when many of the inhabitants were carried into captivity and sold as slaves. After the death of Aurungzebe it again fell into the hands of the Mahrattas.
