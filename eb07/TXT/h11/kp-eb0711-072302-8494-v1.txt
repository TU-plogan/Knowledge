HUMILITY is a virtue consisting in the moderate value which a person puts upon himself, and every thing relating to him. Or, more particularly, it consists in not attributing to ourselves any excellence or good which we have not; in not overrating any thing which we have or do; in not taking an immoderate delight in oneâ€™s self; in not assuming more of the praise of a quality or action than belongs to us; and in a lowly sense and acknowledgment of our imperfections, errors, and sins. This virtue expresses itself in the modesty of our appearance, of our pursuits, and of our behaviour towards other men. It is distinguished from affectation, bashfulness, and meanness.
