HARLEQUIN, in the Italian comedy, a buffoon, dressed in parti-coloured clothes, and answering to our merry-andrew or jack-pudding. We have also introduced harlequin upon our stage, and this is one of the standing characters in the modern grotesque or pantomime entertainments. The term is said to have taken its origin from a famous Italian comedian who appeared in Paris under Henry III., and, from frequenting the house of Îœ. de Harlay, was called by his companions Harlequino, or little Harlay; a name which has descended to those of the same rank and profession.
