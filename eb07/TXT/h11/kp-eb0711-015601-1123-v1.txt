HARROW, a town in the county of Middlesex, in the hundred of Gore, ten miles from London. It is usually distinguished from its situation by the adjunct “on-the-Hill.” It commands extensive prospects on every side, over well cultivated and undulating districts. The church and spire at the highest point present a distinguishing object to the whole country around it. The free school, founded here in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, is one of the most celebrated seminaries for classical learning in the kingdom, and in it the youth of the first families receive the first rudiments of education. The population in 1801 amounted to 2485, in 1811 to 2813, in 1821 to 3017, and in 1831 to 3861.
