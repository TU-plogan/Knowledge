HEWSON, William, a very ingenious anatomist, was born in 1739. He became assistant to Dr Hunter, and afterwards entered into partnership with him; but on their disagreement, he read anatomical lectures at his own house, in which he was seconded by Mr Falconer. He wrote Inquiries into the Properties of the Blood, and the Lymphatic System, 2 vols.; and disputed with Dr Monro the discovery of the lymphatic system of vessels in oviparous animals. Hewson died in 1774.
