HURDLES, in Fortification, are made of twigs of willows or osiers interwoven together, and sustained by long stakes. They are made in the figure of an oblong square, the length being five or six feet, and the breadth three and a half. The closer they are wattled together the better. They serve either to render the batteries firm, or to consolidate the passage over muddy ditches, or to cover traverses and lodgments for the defence of the workmen against fireworks or stones thrown against them.

Hurdles, in Husbandry, certain frames made either of split timber, or of hazel-rods wattled together, to serve as gates in enclosures, or to make sheep-folds, &c.
