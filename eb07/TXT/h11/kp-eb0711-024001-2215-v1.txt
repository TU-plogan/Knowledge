HEPHTHEMIMERIS (composed of ⅛rα, seven, ημnfυς, half, and μiοoς, part), in the Greek and Latin poetry, a sort of verse consisting of three feet and a syllable; that is, of seven half feet.

Hephthemimeris, or Hepthemimeres, is also a caesura after the third foot; that is, on the seventh half-foot. It is a rule that this syllable, though it be short in itself, must be made long on account of the caesura, or to render it an hephthemimeris.
