HABDALA, a ceremony of the Jews, observed on the evening of the Sabbath when every one of the family has returned home. Then they light a taper or lamp, with at least two wicks; upon which the master of the family takes a cup, with some wine, mixed with fragrant spices, and having repeated a passage or two of Scripture, he blesses the wine and spices. He afterwards blesses the light of the fire; and then casts his eyes on his hands and nails, as if remembering that he is going to work. The whole is intended to signify that the Sabbath is over, and is from that moment divided from the day of labour which follows. For this reason the ceremony is called Hahdala, which signifies distinction. After the ceremony is concluded, and the company breaks up, they wish one another, not a good night, but a good week.
