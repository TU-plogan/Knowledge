HILARODI, in the ancient music and poetry, a sort of poets amongst the Greeks, who went about singing little gay poems or songs, somewhat graver than the Ionic pieces, accompanied with some instrument. From the streets they were at last introduced into tragedy, as the magodi were into comedy. They appeared dressed in white, and were crowned with gold. At first they wore shoes; but afterwards they assumed the crepida, being only a sole tied over the foot with a strap.
