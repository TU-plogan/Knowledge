HORN, in Physiology, a hard substance growing on the heads of different animals, particularly the cloven-footed quadrupeds, and serving them both as weapons of offence and defence.

Horn is also a sort of musical instrument of the wind kind, which is chiefly used in hunting, to animate and bring together the dogs and the hunters. The term anciently was, wind a horn, all horns being in those times compassed; but since straight horns have come into fashion, they say blow a horn, and sometimes sound a horn.

The French Horn is merely a wreathed or contorted trumpet.

Horn Distemper, a disease incident to horned cattle, affecting the internal substance of the horn, commonly called the pith, which it insensibly wastes, leaving the horn hollow.

HθRN-Work {ouvrage à corne), in fortification, an outwork composed of a front and two branches; the front consisting of two half bastions and a curtain. This work is of the nature of a crown-work, but smaller, and serves the same purposes. The use of horn-works, in general, is to occupy some rising grounds in advance of the principal fortification, the distance of which determines that of the hornwork; and they are placed either before the curtain or before the bastions, according to circumstances.
