HOWDEN, a market-town of the east riding of the county of York, 184 miles from London. It stands in a level and somewhat marshy district, about one mile from the river Ouse, over which there is a ferry. It is very ancient, and was formerly the seat of the Bishop of Durham. There is a market on Saturday, to which much cor≈Ü is brought; and one of the largest fairs for horses is held in July. The population amounted in 1801 to 1552, in 1811 to 1812, in 1821 to 2080, and in 1831 to 2130.
