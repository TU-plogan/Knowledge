HORNSEY, a large village of the hundred of Ossulton, in the county of Middlesex, five miles north of London, on the ascent of a hill commanding a view over the city. It is one of those places in which the richer citizens have built their rural retreats. The New River winds in a pleasing manner through the lower parts of the parish. The population amounted in 1801 to 2716, in 1811 to 3349, in 1821 to 4122, and in 1831 to 4856.
