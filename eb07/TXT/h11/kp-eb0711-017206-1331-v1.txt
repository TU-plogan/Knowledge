HAWARDEN, or Harden, a market-town of the county of Flint and the hundred of Mold, in North Wales, 197 miles from London and seven from Chester. It has considerable manufactures of earthenware, made from a peculiarly-adapted clay, which abounds in the neighbourhood. This business, and that of an iron foundery, give the chief employment to the inhabitants. In its vicinity are many antiquities both of the Saxon and of earlier periods. There is a good market, which is held on Saturday. The population amounted in 1801 to 4071, in 1811 to 4436, in 1821 to 5159, and in 1831 to 5414.
