HOY, a small vessel chiefly used in coasting, or carrying goods to or from a ship, in a road or bay, where the ordinary lighters cannot be managed with safety or convenience.

Hoy, one of the Orkney Islands, off the north coast of Scotland, is situated between the island of Pomona and the north coast of Caithness, and is separated from the small island of Graemsay by a sound about a mile in breadth. See Orkney Islands.
