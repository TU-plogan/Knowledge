HILARIUS, an ancient father of the Christian church, who flourished in the fourth century. He was born, as St Jerome informs us, at Poictiers, being descended of a good family, and he received a liberal education in the Pagan religion, which he did not forsake till he had arrived at maturity. He was advanced to the bishopric of Poictiers in the year 355, according to Baronius, and became a most zealous champion of the orthodox faith, particularly against the Arians, who were at that time gain- âˆ™, ing ground in France. He assembled there several councils, in which the determinations of the synods of Rimini and Seleucia were condemned. He wrote a treatise concerning Synods, and a work in twelve books on the Trinity, which is much admired by orthodox believers. He died about the end of the year 367. His works have been many times published; but the best edition of them is that by the Benedictines at Paris in 1693.
