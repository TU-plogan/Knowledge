HAJYKAN, a large district within the Afghan territories, situated along the western bank of the Indus, between the 29th and 31st degrees of north latitude. It is chiefly a stripe of land, bounded by the Indus on the east, and a ridge of mountains on the west. Under a regular government it might be rendered fertile and productive; but it is chiefly inhabited by predatory tribes of Afghans and Bal-yoches, who neglect agriculture. The country has been imperfectly explored, and its limits have never been very distinctly defined. The great majority of the inhabitants are of the Soonec sect of Mahommedans.
