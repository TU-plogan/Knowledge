HAINAN, or Hainam, a large island in the China Sea, situated at the southern extremity of that empire, and subject to its authority. It lies between the eighteenth and twentieth degrees of north latitude, and is about 196 miles in length by seventy in average breadth. Although placed so near the tract of ships bound to Canton, very few particulars respecting this island are known. On the south coast are several fine bays, affording good anchorage and shelter from the north-east monsoon; these have been occasionally visited by ships which have met with disasters in the China Seas. Captain Krusenstern mentions that the Ladrone pirates who infest the China Seas have obtained possession of this island.
