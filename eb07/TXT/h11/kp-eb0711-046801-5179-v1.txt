HIPPOMANES, a sort of poison, famous amongst the ancients as an ingredient in love-charms. The word is Greek, i<ιrκομavtς, composed of ∕⅛05, a horse, and μαvtα, fury or madness. At the end of Bayle’s dictionary there is a very learned dissertation on the hippomanes, and all its virtues, both real and pretended.
