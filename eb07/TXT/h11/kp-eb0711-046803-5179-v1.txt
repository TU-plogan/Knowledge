HIPPOPODES, Hippopedes, or Hippopodice (composed of i<κ t κος, horse, and <zοvς, foot), in Ancient Geography, an appellation given to a certain people on the shores of the Scythian Sea, who were supposed to have had horses’ feet. The hippopodes are mentioned by Dionysius (Geogr. V. 310.), Mela (lib. iii. cap. 6), Pliny (lib. iv. cap. 13), and St Augustin (De Civit, lib. xvi. cap. 8). But it is conjectured that they received this appellation on account of their swiftness. Pennant supposes them to have been the inhabitants of the Bothnian Gulf, and that they were the same people as the Finni Ligηipedes of Olaus. They wore snow-shoes, which, he thinks, might fairly give the idea of their being, like horses, hoofed and shod.
