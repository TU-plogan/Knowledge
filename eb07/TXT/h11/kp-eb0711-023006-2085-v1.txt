HEMS, an ancient city of Syria, on the borders of the desert. The present town stands on a fine plain, watered by a rivulet, and does not occupy above one fourth of the space within the walls. It was the ancient Emesa in the time of the Roman empire, and appears to have been fortified with walls about three miles in circumference. It successively changed masters in the various revolutions which took place in this part of Asia, and fell into decay. It contains many ruins and relics of antiquity. It is 120 miles south of Aleppo, and eight north of Damascus. Long. 37. 20. E. Lat. 34. 25. N.
