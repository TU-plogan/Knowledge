HIERES, four small islands in the Mediterranean Sea, a part of the department of the Var in France. They are near Toulon, and form shelter for a roadstead of the same name, where ships are protected by the town of Hiérès on the mainland. That town is small, but is remarkable for the mildness of the climate, and for the quantity of pomegranates, figs, and other fruits, which the vicinity yields.
