HIDES, in a general sense, are the skins of beasts; but the term more particularly denotes those of large cattle, such as bullocks, horses, buffaloes, and the like. Hides are called raw when in the state in which they were taken from the carcass; and green when dressed with some of the neutral salts, such as alum, to prevent them from putrefying. When, by a process called tanning, they are impregnated with a vegetable principle, such as that in oak bark, they are said to be cured or tanned. The reputation of South American hides stands very high, and immense quantities of them are annually imported into this country. Great numbers of hides are also yearly brought to Great Britain from the United States, from the Continent, and from various parts of Africa. In 1832 there was imported into this country 186,982 cwt. 3 qrs. 3 lbs. weight of hides, of which quantity South America alone yielded 89,320 cwt. The duty levied upon the whole was L.25,412. 15s. lid.
