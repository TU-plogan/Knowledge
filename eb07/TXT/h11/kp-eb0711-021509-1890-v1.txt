HELM, a long and flat piece of timber, or an assemblage of several pieces, suspended along the hind-part of a shipâ€™s stern-post, where it turns upon hinges to the right or left, serving to direct the course of the vessel, as the tail of a fish guides the body. See Ship-Building.

There are several terms in nautical language relating to the helm; as, Bear up the helm, that is, let the ship go more large before the wind; Helm a midship, or right the helm, that is, keep it even with the middle of the ship; Port the helm, put it over the left side of the ship; Starboard the helm, put it on the right side of the ship.
