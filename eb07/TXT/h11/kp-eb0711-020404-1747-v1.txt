HECATE, daughter of Perses and Asterie, or of Night, an ancient symbol of the moon, appearing in the Orphic hymns as the first and oldest divinity. She is there called the Almighty Queen of Heaven, the bearer of the keys of the world. As the goddess of fortune, she was the protectress of merchants and highways (Trivia). Hers was the name applied to the new moon, and therefore one of the names of Diana. (See Diana.) She was commonly represented with three bodies, and was worshipped by the Greeks on the 30th day of every month, when the mullet and anchovy were offered to her.
