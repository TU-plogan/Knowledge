HALESOWEN, a market-town of the county of Salop, . in the hundred of Brimstrey, but partly in the county of Worcester, 127 miles from London. The market is held on Monday, but it is thinly attended. There are in the town some inferior branches of the iron manufacture. It is chiefly remarkable for the grounds of the house of the Leasowes, once the residence of the poet Shenstone, to whom a monument has been erected in the parish church, which was'formerly an ancient monastery. The inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 6888, in 1821 to 8187, and in 1831 to 9765.
