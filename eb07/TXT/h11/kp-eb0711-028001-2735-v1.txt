HEROIC, something belonging to a hero or heroine.

Heroic Age is that age or period of the world in which the heroes, or those called by the poets the children of the gods, are supposed to have lived. The heroic age coincides with the fabulous age.

Heroic Poem is that which undertakes to describe some extraordinary action or enterprise. Homer, Virgil, Statius, Lucan, Tasso, Camoens, Milton, Wilkie, Glover, Voltaire, and others, have composed heroic poems. In this sense, heroic coincides with epic poem. Heroic Verse is that in which heroic poems are usually composed, or it is that which is proper for such poems. In the Greek and Latin, hexameter verses are peculiarly denominated heroic verses, as being alone used by epic poets. Alexandrine verses, of twelve syllables, were formerly called heroic verses, as being supposed the only verse proper for heroic poetry; but later writers use verses of ten syllables.
