HOLMS, two islands in the Bristol Channel, distinguished by the appellation of the flat and the steep, which form part of the Welsh county of Glamorgan. On the former is a light-house, and a dwelling for those who superintend the lights, and a few other houses, with about fifty acres of cultivated land. The latter is a rock about 400 feet in height, with a difficult and dangerous access. The soil is sandy, and the vegetation confined, and only fit for rabbits, of whom great numbers are found there.
