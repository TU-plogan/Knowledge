HASTA, or Hαstα Pura, amongst medallists, signifies a kind of spear or javelin, not shod or headed with iron; or rather an ancient sceptre, somewhat longer than ordinary, and occasionally given to all the gods. The hasta is supposed to be a symbol of the goodness of the gods, [7:11:159] and of the conduct of providence, which is equally mild and forcible.

Hasta, in some countries, is a measure or quantity of ground amounting to thirty paces, and so called, according to Du Cange, from the hasta or rod wherewith it was measured.
