STIBADIUM, among the Romans, a low kind of table, couch, or bed, of a circular form, which succeeded to the triclinia, and was of different sizes according to the number of guests for which it was designed. Tables of this kind were called hexaclina, octaclina, or enneaclina, according as they held six, eight, or nine guests, and so of any oilier number.
