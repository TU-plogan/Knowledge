STRATHMORE, or the Great Strath, is that district of Scotland which stretches across from the town of Stonehaven in Kincardineshire, on the east coast, to the district of Cowal in Argyleshire, on the west coast. The chain of the Grampian Mountains bounds it on the north, and the Sidlaw, Ochill, and Menteith or Lennox range of hills on the south. There is also a vale of the same name in the parish of Durness, Sutherlandshire.
