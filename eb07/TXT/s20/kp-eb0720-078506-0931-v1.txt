STYLE, a word of various significations, originally deduced from stylos, a kind of bodkin wherewith the ancients wrote on plates of lead, or on wax, &c. and which is still used to write on ivory leaves and paper prepared for that purpose.

Style, in language, is the peculiar manner in which a man expresses his conceptions. It is a picture of the ideas which rise in his mind, and of the order in which they are there produced. See Rhetoric. Old Style, the Julian method of computing time, as the New Style is the Gregorian method of computation. See Chronology.
