SOONTABURDAR, in the East Indies, an attendant, who carries a silver bludgeon in his hand, about two or three feet long, and runs before the palanquin. He is inferior to the chubdar; the propriety of an Indian newaury requiring two soontaburdars for every chubdar in the train. The chubdar proclaims the approach of visitors, &c. He generally carries a large silver staff about five feet long in his hands; and among the nabobs he proclaims their praises aloud as he runs before their palanquins.
