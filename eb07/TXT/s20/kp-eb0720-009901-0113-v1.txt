SENSIBLE Note, in Music (derived from the French term note sensible), means simply the note which ascends by a semitone to the tonic or key-note of any scale, major or minor. For example, in scale of C, B to C; or in scale of A, G# to A, and so on. (See M usic .) This note is one of the marked characteristics of modern European tonality.
