SOONDA, a town and district of Hindustan, in the pro vince of North Canara. The district, which is small, is situated between the 14th and 15th degrees of north lati tude, above the Western Ghauts. Formerly the country was well cultivated, and produced fine timber and pepper, betel nut, cardamoms, and plantains. Towards the eastern division of the country, the great object of agriculture is rice. Having been the seat of war between Hyder and the Mahrattas, it was greatly wasted by the former in 1763, and its rajah compelled to fly for protection to Goa; on which occasion he surrendered the whole of his territory below the Ghauts for a stipulated pension. In 1799 the Soonda district became the property of the British, with whom it remains. The capital, of the same name, was formerly an extensive and populous town, and was defended by strong fortifications, which were levelled by Hyder, who also nearly destroyed the town. Long. 74. 58. E. Lat. 14. 34. N.
