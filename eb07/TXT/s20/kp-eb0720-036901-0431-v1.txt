SION, a small town and port in the island of Bombay, situated about nine miles from the presidency, at the opposite extremity of the island, on the top of a small conical hill, where it commands the passage from Bombay to the neighbouring island of Salsette. A causeway was built by Mr. Duncan across a small arm of the sea, which separated the two islands. It has a draw-bridge in the centre.
