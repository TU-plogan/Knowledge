SEXTANT, in Mathematics, denotes the sixth part of a circle, or an arch comprehending sixty degrees.

The word sextant is more particularly used for an astronomical instrument made like a quadrant, excepting that its limb only comprehends sixty degrees. The use and application of the sextant is the same with that of the quadrant.
