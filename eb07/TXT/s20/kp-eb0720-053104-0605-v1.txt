SPECTACLES, in Dioptrics, an instrument consisting of two lenses set in silver, horn, &c. to assist the defects of the organ of sight. Old people, and others who have flat eyes, use convex spectacles, which cause the rays of light to converge so as to meet upon the retina; whereas myopes, or shortsighted people, use concave lenses for spec tacles, which cause the rays to diverge, and prevent their meeting before they reach the retina. See Optics .
