SELBY, a town of the wapentake of Barton Ash, in the west riding of the county of York, 178 miles from London. It is situated in a level country on the banks of the Ouse, and having a canal which unites that river with the Aire and Calder, has a considerable trade carried on by inland navigation. It has a fine bridge over the Ouse, constructed so as not to impede the vessels. There are some establishments for building large trading ships. The church is a conventual edifice, formerly belonging to the Benedictine monks. There is a good market, which is held on Wednesdays. The population in 1821 amounted to 4097, and in 1831 to 4600.
