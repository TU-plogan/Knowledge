SHAW, Dr Thomas, known to the learned world by his Travels to Barbary and the Levant, was bom at Kendal, in Westmoreland, about the year 1692. He was appointed chaplain to the English consul at Algiers, in which station he continued for several years; and thence took proper opportunities of travelling into different parts. He returned in 1733, was elected fellow of the Royal Society, and published the account of his travels at Oxford, 1738, folio. In 1740 he was nominated principal of St Edmond Hall, which he raised from a ruinous state by his munificence; and was regius professor of Greek at Oxford until his death, which happened in 1751. Dr Clayton, bishop of Clogher, having attacked these Travels in his Description of the East, Dr Shaw published, by way of vindication, a supplement, which is incorporated into the second edition of his Travels, prepared by himself, and published in 1757, 4to.
