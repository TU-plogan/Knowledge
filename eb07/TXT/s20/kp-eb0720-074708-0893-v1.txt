STRATHAVEN, a town in Lanarkshire, Scotland, sixteen miles from Glasgow. It is pleasantly situated at the end of a ridge of small eminences, on the banks of the Pomilion, which runs through it, and divides it into two parts. The original part of the town is old, as is shown by its being erected into a borough of barony in the year 1450, and is most irregularly built, the streets being crowded together, and intersected by long narrow lanes. The modern part is well laid out, and in it are many excellent houses. A number of neat small villas has also been erected in the neighbourhood, by the wealthier burgesses. The old castle of Strathaven overhangs the town, and, though now in ruins, adds considerably to its beauty. The inhabitants are an industrious, enterprising class of individuals; and from their business habits they are yearly[7:20:748] raising their town to greater importance. Considerable business is done in the cotton trade. In addition to the established church, there are chapels belonging to the Relief and United Secession bodies of dissenters. The markets for agricultural and commercial produce are well supplied. The streets and shops are lighted with gas; and in consequence of the Pomilion running through it, the supply of water has contributed greatly to its cleanliness and comfort. The population in 1821 amounted to 2866, and in 1831 it had increased to 3597, an increase caused principally by the flourishing state of its trade and manufactures.
