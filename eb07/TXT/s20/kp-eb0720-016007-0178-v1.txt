SETTLE, a town of the parish of Giggleswick, in the wapentake of Staincliff and Ewcross, in the west riding of the county of York, 253 miles from London. Its situation is very romantic, on the river Ribble, among the hills that separate the counties of York and Lancaster. There is a large market-place, well attended on Thursdays. Near the town is the curious phenomenon of an ebbing and flowing well. In the neighbourhood arc some curious Roman antiquities. The population amounted in 1821 to 1508, and in 1831 to 1627.
