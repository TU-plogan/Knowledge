SEXTUS Empiricus, a famous Pyrrhonian philosopher, who lived in the second century, under the reign of Antoninus. He was a physician of the sect of the Empirics, and is said to have been one of the preceptors of Antoninus the Philosopher. There are still extant his Pyrrhonian Institutions, and a large work against the mathematicians. The best edition of Sextus Empiricus is that of Fabricius in Greek and Latin, printed at Leipsic in 1718, folio.
