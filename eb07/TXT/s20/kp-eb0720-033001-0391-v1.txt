SIDUS,Georgium, in Astronomy, a new primary planet, discovered by Dr. Herschel in the year 1781. By most foreign, and even by some British philosophers, it is known by the name of Herschel, in honour of the discoverer. As the other planets are distinguished by marks or characters, the planet Herschel is distinguished by an H, the initial letter of the discovererâ€™s name, and a cross to shew that it is a Christian planet.
