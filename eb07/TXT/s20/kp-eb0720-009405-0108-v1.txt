SENJEN, one of the largest islands of the kingdom of Norway, after Hindoen. It is separated from the continent by a narrow strait, and is about fifty miles in length and thirty-nine in breadth. It is surrounded by cliffs of more than 600 feet in height, which are covered with birch and pine trees; and, considering the climate, there are some tolerably good sections of pasture-land, upon which black cattle are reared. It comprehends three parishes, viz. Bergfiord cum Medfiord, with 370 inhabitants; Torask, with 350; and Tronoe, with 1560. There are two trading ports on the shore, Klowen and Gabostad, where small vessels repair.
