SERVIA, a province of Turkey in Europe, bounded on the north by the rivers Danube and Save, which separate it from Hungary; on the east it is bounded by Bulgaria; on the west by Bosnia; and on the south by Albania and Macedonia. It is about 190 miles in length from east to west, ninety-five in breadth from north to south, and it is divided into four sangiacates. Two of these were ceded to the Christians in 1718, who united them into one. This continued till 1739, when the Turks were victorious, and then they were abandoned to the Turks by the treaty of Belgrade. Belgrade is the capital town.
