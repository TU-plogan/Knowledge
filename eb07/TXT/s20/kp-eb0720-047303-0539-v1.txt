SOLO, or Saura-Corta, an inland town of Java, the capital of a district, and the residence of an emperor. It is large and populous, intersected with broad and shaded avenues or streets, running at right angles. The emperor’s palace is very spacious, and comprises several palaces in its area. The European town and port are very neat. The resident’s house is also a large and handsome building. A fine river, which flows near the town, and falls into the harbour of Grepie, affords in the rainy season a ready conveyance for the various productions of a large tract of country, in exchange for commodities which are sent up in boats from the coast.

Solo, (Ital.) a term used in musical compositions of several parts, to mark those voices or instruments that are to perform alone or in a more prominent manner; as, sofrano solo, violino solo, See. The plural is used when two or more voices or instruments of the same name are to perform alone. Solo is also a name given to a composition written for a single instrument, such as a violin, an oboe, a flute, &c., which is accompanied by a bass for the violoncello, or a thorough-bass for the pianoforte.
