SHOUMSHU or Choumchoo, one of the Kurile islands, the nearest to Asia, thirty-six miles in length and twenty in breadth. It contains mines, which yield a small quantity of silver. There are large lakes abounding with fish, and the natives have an herb from which they extract brandy. There are only forty-four male inhabitants, who pay tribute to Russia. It is ten miles south from Kamtschatka.
