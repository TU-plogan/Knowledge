SPECTRA, images presented to the eye after removing them from a bright object, or closing them. When any one has long and attentively looked at a bright object, as at the setting sun, on closing his eyes, or removing them, an im age, which resembles in form the object he was attending to, continues some time to be visible. This appearance in the eye we call the ocular spectrum of that object. These ocular spectra are of four kinds: 1st, Such as are owing to a less sensibility of a defined part of the retina, or spectra from defect of sensibility. 2d, Such as are owing to a greater sensibility of a defined part of the retina, or spectra from excess of sensibility. 3d, Such as resemble their object in its colour as well as form; which may be termed direct ocular spectra, 4th, Such as are of a colour contrary to that of their object, which may be termed re verse ocular spectra
