STEYER, a city of Austria, in the province of the Upper Ens, the capital of the circle of Traun. It stands at the junction of the two rivers Steyer and Traun, which, when united, flow into the Danube. It is a place of great industry, and contains various manufactories. There are some of cotton and of linen goods; but the chief occupation is that of preparing cutlery and arms of various kinds, the latter chiefly for the imperial armies. The other necessaries for the equipment of armies are also extensively fabricated. The city contains 10,640 inhabitants, having of late years greatly increased. Long. 14. 14. 45. E. Lat 48. 4.45. N.
