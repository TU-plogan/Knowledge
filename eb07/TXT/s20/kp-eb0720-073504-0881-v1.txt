STOKESLEY, a town in the north riding of the county of York, and in the wapentake of Langborough. It is 242 miles from London, and forty-three from York. It stands on the river Lcven, and consists of one well-built, long street, with no remarkable building except the manor-house, adjoining to the churchyard, which at an early period was granted to Guy de Balio), whose family came to England with William the Conqueror. The town depends on the fertility of the land around it, from which a market on Saturday is well supplied. The parish comprises four small townships. The population amounted in 1801 to 1755, in 1811 to 1759, in 1821 to 2290, and in 1831 to 2376.
