SIGNATURE, in Printing, is a letter put at the bottom of the first page at least, in each sheet, as a direction to the binder in folding, gathering, and collating them. The signatures consist of the capital letters of the alphabet, which change in every sheet; and if there be more sheets than letters in the alphabet,a figure is placed before the signature, as 2 A, 2 B, &c., which are repeated as often as necessaÎ¹y.
