SIDON, in Ancient Geography a city of Phoenicia in Asia, famous in Scripture for its riches, arising from the extensive commerce carried on by its inhabitants. Heavy judgments were denounced against the Sidonianson account of their wickedness, which were accomplished in the time[7:20:330] of Ochus king of Persia. That monarch having come against them with an army on account of their rebellion, the city was betrayed by its king; upon which the wretched inhabitants, seized with despair, set fire to their houses, and forty thousand, with their wives and children, perished in the flames. It is forty-five miles west from Damascus. E. long. 36. 5. N. lat. 37.
