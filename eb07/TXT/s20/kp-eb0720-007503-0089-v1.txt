See Beeroo Isle, an island that lies off the west coast of Sumatra, and is situated principally between the first and second degrees of south latitude, and the ninety-eighth and ninety-ninth of east longitude. It is seventy miles in length by ten in average breadth, and contains a volcano, which renders it conspicuous at a distance.
