SECKENDORF, Guy Louis de, a very learned German, descended from an ancient and noble family, was born at Aurach, in Franconia, in 1626. He was a good linguist, learned in law, history, and divinity, and is staid to have been a tolerable painter and engraver. He was honourably employed by several of the German princes; and died counsellor of state to Frederick III., elector of Brandenburg, and chancellor of the university of Halle, in 1692. He wrote many books, particularly a history and defence of the Lutheran religion, in Latin, in two volumes folio, Frankfort, 1602.
