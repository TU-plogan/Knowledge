ULYSSES, king of Ithaca, the son of Lacrtes and father of Telemachus, and one of those heroes who contributed most to the taking of Troy. After the destruction of that city, he wandered for ten years, and at last returned to Ithaca, where, with the assistance of Telemachus, he killed Antinous and other princes who intended to marry his wife Penelope and seize his dominions. He at length resigned the government of the kingdom to his son Telemachus, and was killed by Telegonus, his son by Circe, who did not know him. This hero is the subject of the Odyssey.
