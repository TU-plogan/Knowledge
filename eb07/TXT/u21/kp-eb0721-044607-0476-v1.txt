UKRAINE, a large country of Europe, lying on the borders of Turkey in Europe, Poland, Russia, and Little Tartary. Its name properly signifies a frontier. By a treaty between Russia and Poland in 1693, the latter remained in possession of all that part of the Ukraine lying on the west side of the river Dnieper, which is but indifferently cultivated; while the country on the east side, inhabited by the Cossacks, is in much better condition. The Russian part is comprised in the government of Kiof; and the empress of Russia having obtained the Polish palatinate of Kiof by the treaty of partition in 1793, the whole of the Ukraine, on both sides of the Dnieper, now belongs to that ambitious and formidable power. The principal town is Kiof. See Russia.
