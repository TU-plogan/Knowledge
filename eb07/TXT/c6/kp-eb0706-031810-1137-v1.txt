CHANT (cantus) is used for the vocal music of churches. In church history we meet with divers kinds d√¨ chants or songs. The first is the Ambrosian, established by St Ambrose; the second is the Gregorian, introduced by Pope Gregory the Great, who established schools of chanters, and corrected the church song. This is still retained in [7:6:319] the church under the name of plain song ; at first it was called the Homan song. The plain or Gregorian chant is where the choir and people sing in unison, or all together in the same manner.
