CLASSIC, or Classical, an epithet applied chiefly to authors read in the elasses at schools. This term seems to owe its origin to Tullius Servius, who, in order to make an estimate of every personâ€™s estate, divided the Roman people into six portions, which he ealled classes. The estate of the first class was not to be under L.200, and these by way of eminence were called classici, classics; hence authors of the first rank came to be called classics, while all the rest were said to be infra classem. Thus Aristotle is a classic author in philosophy, and Aquinas in school divinity.
