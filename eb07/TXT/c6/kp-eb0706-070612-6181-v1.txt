CITEAUX, a village of the department of Côte ďOr, in France, containing 670 inhabitants. It was a place of great note on account of its abbey, the abbot of which was the superior of the whole Cistercian order, and under whom were more than 1800 monks and nuns. It was the bury· ing-place of the ancient monarchs of Burgundy, but now all these institutions are abolished, and the church is in ruins.
