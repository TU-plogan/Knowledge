CHITTOR, a town and fortress of Hindustan, situated on the western frontier of the Carnatic, eighty miles east from Madras. It was, in 1721, the residence of the military commander of the district, Tahir Khan, and was situated among mountains, and well fortified. It was selected by the nabob Anwarraddeen Khan as a place of [7:6:592] refuge in times of danger. Itwas occupied by his younger son, with several females of the family, when it was assaulted and taken in 1780 by Hyder Ali. It was afterwards retaken by Sir Eyre Coote. In 1801 it was made over to the British; and the polygars, who were extremely turbulent and refractory, were reduced by a military force sent against them in 1804. Long. 79. 10. E. Lat. 13. 12. N.
