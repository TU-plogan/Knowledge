CAMILLI and Camillae, in Antiquity, boys and girls of ingenuous birth, who ministered in the sacrifices of the gods; and especially those who attended the Flamen Dialis, or priest of Jupiter. The word seems borrowed from the language of the ancient Etrurians, in which it was written casmillus, and signified minister. The Tuscans also gave the appellation Camillus to Mercury, in quality of minister of the gods.
