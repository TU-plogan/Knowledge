CHANTILLY, a market-town of the department of the Oise, in France, with 1600 inhabitants, some of whom are employed in the linen manufacture, and in making lace and cotton goods. Near to it was once the most magnificent palace in France, with stables and a park of great celebrity. These premises have, however, suffered much from neglect. It is situated on the great road from Calais to Paris.
