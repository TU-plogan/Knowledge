CASCAES, a small town in Portugal. It is a sea-port, but principally inhabited by fishermen. It is in the province of Portuguese Estremadura, not far from the city of Cintra, and near to the forts Nossa Senhora, Da Levy, and S. Martha, and the warm baths of Estoril. The inhabitants trade to the West Indies, and many of them are engaged in smuggling. The town contains 605 houses, and has a population of 2484 souls.
