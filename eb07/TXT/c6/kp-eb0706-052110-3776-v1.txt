CHICHAS, a province of Bolivia, in the department of Potosi, in South America. It is an elevated district, and hence the climate is cold. Some parts of it, however, enjoy a milder temperature, and accordingly the vegetation is more abundant and varied. Grain and wine are in such situations produced in considerable quantities; but this province derives its chief importance from its silver mines, which have obtained celebrity on account of the richness and abundance of their ores. The value of some of these, however, is considerably lessened by being situated in a barren and unproductive region, where water is scarce.
