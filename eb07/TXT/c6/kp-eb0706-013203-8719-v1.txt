CARACTACUS, a renowned king of the ancient British people called Silures, inhabiting South Wales. Having valiantly defended his country seven years against the Romans, he was at length defeated; and, flying to Cartismunda, queen of the Brigantes (inhabitants of Yorkshire), was by her treacherously delivered up to the Romans, and led in triumph to the Emperor Claudius, then at York, where his noble behaviour, and heroic but pathetic speech, obtained him not only his liberty, but the esteem of the emperor, a. d. 52. See article Britain.
