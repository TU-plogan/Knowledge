CALLIPAeDIA, the art of getting or breeding fine and beautiful children. Divers rules and practices relating to this art are to be found in ancient and modern writers. Claude Quillet de Chinon, a French abbot, under the fictitious name of Clavicles Loetus, has published a Latin poem in four books, under the title of Callipaedia, seu de pulchrae prolis habendes ratione, in which are contained all the precepts of that art. Mr Rowe translated this poem into verse.
