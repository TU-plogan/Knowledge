It is built at the foot of the Egeberge, in a beautiful valley, surrounded by country seats. It is an open city, and defended only by the fortress Aggerhuus. The streets are broad and at right angles, the public buildings and dwellings mostly of stone. It contains, including the suburbs, about 12,000 inhabitants. It is the seat of the university, with 150 students,-to which belongs a library and several collections of natural history and antiquities. It has few manufactures.
