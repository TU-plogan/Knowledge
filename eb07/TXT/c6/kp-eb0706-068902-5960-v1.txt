CHUWAL, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Guierat, situated between the 23d and 24th degrees of [7:6:690] north latitude, and about the 72d degree of east longitude. The Banass river bounds it on the north-west; and the district adjacent to this river is low-marshy land, and subject to inundation. The country beyond this has been but imperfectly explored, and very little is known concerning it. It is possessed by different independent chiefs.
