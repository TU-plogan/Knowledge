CALUMNY, the crime of accusing another falsely, and knowingly so, of some heinous offence.

Oath of Calumny, Juramentum, or rather Jusjurandum, Calumniae, or de Calumnia, among civilians and canonists, was an oath which both parties in a cause were obliged to take; the plaintiff that he did not bring his charge, and the defendant that he did not deny it, with a design to abuse each other, but because they believed their cause was just and good; that they would not deny the truth, nor create unnecessary delays, nor offer the judge or evidence any gifts or bribes. If the plaintiff refused this oath, the complaint or libel was dismissed; if the defendant, he was held pro confesso. This custom was taken from the ancient athletae, who, before they engaged, were bound to swear that they had no malice, nor would use any unfair means for overcoming each other. The juramentum calumniae is much disused, as a great occasion of perjury.
