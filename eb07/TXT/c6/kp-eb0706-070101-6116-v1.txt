CINYRA, in the Jewish antiquities, a musical instrument. This, and the Hebrew cinnor, which is generally translated cithara, lyra, or psalterium, are the same. It was made of wood, and was played in the temple of Jerusalem. Josephus says that the cinyra of the temple had ten strings, and that it was touched with a bow. In another place he says that Solomon caused a great number of them to be made of a precious kind of metal called electrum, thus contradicting the Scriptures, which inform us that Solomonâ€™s cinnors were made of wood.
