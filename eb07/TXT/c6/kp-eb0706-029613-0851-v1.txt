CERTIORARI, in Law, a writ which issues out of the chancery, directed to an inferior court, to call up the records of a cause there depending, in order that justice may be done. It is not only used out of the court of chancery, but likewise out of the kingâ€™s bench, in which last-mentioned court it lies where the king would be certified of a record.
