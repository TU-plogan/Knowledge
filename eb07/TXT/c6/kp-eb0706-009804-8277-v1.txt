CANTA, a province and government of Peru, bounded [7:6:99] on the north-east and east by Tarma, on the west by Chancay, and on the south by Huarochiri. It is twenty-four leagues in length from north to south, and thirty-five in width from east to west. The territory is mountainous, being generally situated in the Cordillera. The pastures, which are rich and extensive, are grazed by large herds of cattle; and the lama or Peruvian sheep, with the vicuna or wild goat, are to be found in great numbers in the mountainous parts. The capital, which is of the same name, is situated in lat. 11. 10. S.
