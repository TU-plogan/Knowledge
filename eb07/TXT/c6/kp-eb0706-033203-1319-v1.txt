CHARTOPHYLAX, the name of an officer of the church of Constantinople, who attends at the door of the rails when the sacrament is administered, and gives notice to the priests to come to the holy table. He represents the patriarch upon the bench, tries all ecclesiastical causes, keeps all the marriage registers, assists at the consecration of bishops, and presents the bishop elect at the solemnity[7:6:333], and likewise all other subordinate clergy. This office resembles in some shape that of the bibliothecarius at Rome.
