CLITUS, brother to Alexander the Great’s nurse. He fo'l∩wed that prince in his conquests, and saved his life by cutting off the hand of Rosaces, who held an axe uplifted to kill him at the passage of the Granicus. Alexander, who had a great regard for him, some time afterwards invited him to supper; when Clitus, at the end of the repast, being heated with wine, depreciated the exploits of that prince, in order to magnify those of his father Philip. This so enraged Alexander, that he killed Clitus with his own hand; but he was afterwards so afflicted at what he had done, that he attempted his own life.
