CERAMI, a town of the intendancy of Catania, in the island of Sicily, on a hill of the Modonia range of mountains, and very healthy, with 3400 inhabitants.

C ERATION, the name given by the ancients to the small seeds of ceratonia, used by the Arabian physicians as a weight to adjust the doses of medicines; as the grain weight with us took its rise from a grain of barley.

Ceration, or Ceratium, was also a silver coin, equal to one third of an obolus.
