CANDLESTICK, an instrument to hold a candle, made in different forms and of all sorts of materials.

The golden candlestick was one of the sacred utensils which Moses caused to be placed in the Jewish tabernacle. It was made of hammered gold, a talent in weight, and consisted of seven branches, adorned at equal distances with six flowers like lilies, and with as many bowls and knobs placed alternately, and it was supported by a base or foot-stand. Upon the stock and six branches of the candlestick were the golden lamps, which were immovable, and filled with oil and cotton.

These seven lamps were lighted every evening, and extinguished every morning. The lamps had their tongs or snuffers with which to draw the cotton in or out, and dishes underneath them to receive the sparks or droppings of the oil. This candlestick was placed in the antichamber of the sanctuary, on the south side, and served to illuminate the altar of perfume and the tabernacle of the shew-bread. When Solomon had built the temple of the Lord, he placed in it ten golden candlesticks of the same form as that described by Moses, five on the north and five on the south side of the holy of holies; but after the Babylonish captivity, the golden candlestick was again placed in the temple, as it had been before in the tabernacle by Moses. Upon the destruction of the temple by the Romans, this sacred utensil was lodged in the temple of Peace built by Vespasian; and the representation of it is still to be seen on the triumphal arch at the foot of Mount Palatine, on which Vespasianâ€™s triumph is delineated.
