CARMONA, a city of Spain, in Andalusia, in what is called the kingdom of Seville. It is situated on a gentle elevation, and towards the south overlooks a plain, one of the richest in Spain, being almost wholly covered, for more than twenty miles, with woods of olive trees. A castle, now in ruins, was formerly the principal fortress of Peter, called the cruel king of Aragon; and it contained a spacious palace within its defences. When the Romans ruled in Spain, this place, then called Carmone, was one of their stations; and numerous inscriptions and other remains of that people are found in this vicinity. It is in longitude 5. 8. 51. W. and in latitude 37. 28. 1. N. This city now contains 12,685 inhabitants.
