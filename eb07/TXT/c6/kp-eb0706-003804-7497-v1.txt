CAMERLINGO, according to Du Cange, signified formerly the pope’s or emperor’s treasurer. At present camerlingo is nowhere used but at Rome, where it denotes the cardinal who governs the ecclesiastical state, and administers justice. It is the most eminent office at the court of Rome, because he who holds it is at the head of the treasury. During a vacation of the papal chair, the cardinal camcrlingo publishes edicts, coins money, and exercises every other prerogative of a sovereign prince. He has under him a treasurer-general, auditor-general, and twelve prelates called clerks of the chamber.
