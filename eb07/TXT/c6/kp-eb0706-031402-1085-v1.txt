CHAMIER, Daniel, an eminent Protestant divine, born in Dauphiny. He was many years preacher at Mon-tellimart, whence he went in 1612 to Montaubon, to be professor of divinity in that city, and was killed by a cannon-bali during the siege in 1621. The most considerable of his works is his Panstratia Catholica, or Wars of the Lord, in four volumes folio; in which he treats very learnedly of the controversies between the Protestants and Roman Catholics, and particularly applies himself to refute Bcllarmin.
