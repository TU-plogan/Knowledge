CALLIRRHOE, in Ancient Geography, surnamed En-ηeαeruηos from its nine springs or channels, a fountain not far from Athens, greatly adorned by Peisistratus, where there were several wells, but this the only running spring. Callirrhoe was also the name of a very fine spring of hot water beyond Jordan, near the Dead Sea, into which it empties itself.
