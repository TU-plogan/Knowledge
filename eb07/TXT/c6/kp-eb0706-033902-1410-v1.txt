CHAUVIN, Stephen, a celebrated minister of the reformed religion, born at Nismes, left France at the revocation ofthe edict of Nantes, and retired to Rotterdam, where he began a new Journal des Sçavansyanå, afterwards removing to Berlin, continued it there three years. At this last place he was made professor of philosophy, and discharged that office with much honour and reputation. His principal work is a philosophical dictionary in Latin, which he published at Rotterdam in 1692, and gave a new edition of it, much augmented, at Lewarden, in 1703, in folio. He died in 1725, aged eighty-five.
