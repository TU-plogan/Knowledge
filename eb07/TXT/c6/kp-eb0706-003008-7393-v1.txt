CAMASSEI, or Camace, Andrea, painter of history and landscape, was born at Bevagna, and at first learned the principles of design and colouring from Domenichino; but afterwards he studied in the school of Andrea Sacchi, and proved a very great painter. He was employed in St Peterâ€™s at Rome, as also at St John Lateran; and his works are extremely admired for the sweetness of his colouring,the elegance of his thoughts and design, and likewise for the delicacy of his pencil. Sandrart laments that the world was deprived of so promising a genius in the very bloom of life, when his reputation was daily advancing. He died in 1657.
