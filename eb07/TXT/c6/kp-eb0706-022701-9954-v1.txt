CASTELL, Dr Edmund, a learned English divine of the seventeenth century, distinguished by his skill in the eastern languages. He was educated at Cambridge, where he became master of Catharine Hall and Arabic professor; and he was at length appointed canon of Canterbury. He had the greatest share in the Polyglott Bible of London, and wrote the Heptaglotton pro septem Orientalibus. On this work, which occupied a great part of his life, he bestowed incredible pains and expense, even to the injury of his constitution and his fortune, having expended upon it no less than L.12,000. At length, when it was printed, the copies remained unsold upon his hands. He died in 1685, and lies buried in the churchyard of Higham Gobyon, in Bedfordshire, of which he was rector. It appears from the inscription on his monument, which he erected in his lifetime, that he was chaplain to Charles II. He bequeathed all his oriental manuscripts to the university of Cambridge, on condition that his name should be written on every copy in the collection.
