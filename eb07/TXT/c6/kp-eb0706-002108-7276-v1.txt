CALIAN, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Aurungabad[7:6:22], which was formerly of larger size and of greater importance than it is at present, being now a poor place, inhabited by Mahommedans. It was exposed to many sieges during the wars which were carried on between the Mahommedans and the Mahrattas, and is now surrounded with the ruins of numerous forts. It still carries on some traffic in cocoa nuts, oil, coarse cloth, brass, and other ware. It is 32 miles north-east from Bombay, and 91 from Poonah. Long. 73. 12. E. Lat. 19. 17. N.
