CASUALTY, in a general sense, denotes an accident, or a thing happening by chance, not design. It is particularly used for an accident producing unnatural death.

Casualty, in Scotch Law, means a condition, accident, or contingency of feu-holding. The casualties of a superior are those duties and emoluments which a superior has aright to demand out of his vassalâ€™s estate, over and above the constant yearly duties established by the reddendo of his charter, upon certain casual events.
