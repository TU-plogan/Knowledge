CARR, a kind of rolling throne, used in triumphs, and at the splendid entries of princes. The word is derived from the ancient Gaulish or Celtic carr, mentioned by Caesar in his Commentaries under the name of cams. Plutarch relates that Camillus having entered Rome in triumph, mounted on a carr drawn by four white horses, it was looked on as too haughty an innovation.

Carr, or Car, is also used for a kind of light open chariot. The carr, on medals, drawn by horses, lions, or elephants, usually signifies either a triumph or an apotheosis; sometimes it indicates a procession of the images of the gods at solemn supplication, and sometimes of those of some illustrious family at a funeral. The carr covered and drawn by mules signifies a consecration, and the honour done any one of having his image carried at the gates of the circus.
