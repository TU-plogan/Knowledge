CHICA Nayakana Hully, a large square town of Hindustan, in the province of Mysore, strongly fortified with mud walls and cavaliers at the angles. In the centre is a square citadel fortified in a similar manner. The town contains about six hundred houses, eighty of which are occupied by Brahmins. The houses are at present very mean and ruinous, and do not nearly occupy the whole space within the walls. There is a garden which belongs to the government in great disorder, the appearance of which is destroyed by two banyan trees loaded with large bats, which the people will not disturb. There was formerly a large suburb to the south of the town, which about sixty years ago was destroyed by an invasion of the Mahrattas. It was again plundered by a Mahratta leader on his way to join Lord Cornwallis; and when the inhabitants withdrew, they were enticed back by promises of protection, and were put to the torture in order to extort a discovery of their hidden treasures. During the remainder of Tippooâ€™s reign the town continued to languish. It possesses a small manufacture of coarse cotton cloth, and has also a weekly fair, at which their goods, and the produce of the numerous palm gardens in the neighbourhood, are sold. Many of the inhabitants act as carriers, and transport goods to different places. The name signifies the town of the little chief, which was given to it by the Polygars, who fortified it three hundred years ago.
