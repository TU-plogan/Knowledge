CARVING, in a general sense, the art or act of cutting or fashioning a hard body, by means of some sharp instrument, especially a chisel. In this sense carving includes statuary and engraving, as well as cutting in wood. Carving, in a more particular sense, is the art of engraving or cutting figures in wood. In this sense carving, according to Pliny, is prior both to statuary and painting.
