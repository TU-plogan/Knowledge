CAPILUPI, or Capilupus, Camillus, a native of Mantua, in the sixteenth century. He wrote a book entitled The Stratagem, in which he relates not only what was perpetrated at Paris during the massacre on St Bartholomewâ€™s day, but also the artful preparations which preceded that horrid massacre. It is, howevpr, blended with a great number of fabrications.

Capilupi, Laelius, an Italian poet, brother to the former, made himself famous by some centos of Virgil. The manner in which he applied Virgil's expressions to represent things which the poet never dreamt of is remarkable. His cento against women is very ingenious, but too satirical. The poems of Capilupi arc inserted in the Delicioe Poetarum Italorum.
