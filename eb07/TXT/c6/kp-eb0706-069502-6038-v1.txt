CICISBEO, an Italian term, which in its etymology signifies a whisperer ; a term bestowed in Italy both on lovers, and on those who to outward appearance act as such, waiting on married ladies with as much attention and respect as if they were their lovers. This Italian custom has been spoken of very reproachfully by some writers; but Mr Baretti has taken great pains to vindicate it. He ascribes it to a spirit of gallantry, derived from the age of chivalry, and much heightened and refined by the revival of the Platonic philosophy in Italy about the thirteenth century, and by the verses of Petrarch to Laura, and by his numerous imitators.
