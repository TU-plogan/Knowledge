CEREMONIAL Ã‡ceremoniale), a book in which is prescribed the order of the ceremonies to be observed in certain actions and occasions of solemnity and pomp. The ceremonial of the Roman church is called ordo Romanus. It was published in 1516, by the Bishop of Corcyra; but the College of Cardinals were so scandalized at it, that some of them wished to have the author as well as his book burnt, for his temerity in exposing the sacred ceremonies to the eyes of profane people.

Ceremonial is also used for the set or system of rules and ceremonies which custom has introduced for regulating[7:6:296] our behaviour, and which persons practise towards each other, either from duty, decency, or civility.

Ceremonial, in a more limited sense, denotes the manner in which princes and ambassadors are in use to receive and to treat one another.

Ceremonial is more particularly used in speaking of the laws and regulations given by Moses relating to the worship of God among the ancient Jews. In this sense it amounts to nearly the same with what is called the Levitical Law, and stands contradistinguished from the moral as well as judicial law.
