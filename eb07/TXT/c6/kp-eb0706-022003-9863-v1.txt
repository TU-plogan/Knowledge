CASSIUS, Spurius, a renowned Roman general and consul. His enemies having accused him of aspiring to royalty, he was precipitated from the Tarpeian rock 485 years before Christ, after having thrice enjoyed the consular dignity, been once general of the horse under the first dictator created at Rome, and twice received the honour of a triumph.

Cassius Longinus, a celebrated Roman lawyer, who flourished 113 years before Christ. He was so inflexible a judge, that his tribunal was called the “Rock of the Impeached.” From the judicial severity of this Cassius, very severe judges have been called Cassiam. Cassius, Caius, one of the murderers of Julius Caesar. After his defeat by Mark Antony at the battle of Philippi, he ordered one of his freedmen to put him to death with his own sword, 41 years before Christ.
