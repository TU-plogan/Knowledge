CIVOLI, or Cigoli, Lewis, an Italian painter, who bore the family name of Cardi, was born at the castle of Cigoli, in Tuscany, in the year 1559. His Ecce Homo, which he performed as a trial of skill with Barochio and Michael Angelo de Caravaggio, was judged better than those executed by his competitors. He excelled in designing, and was employed by the popes and princes of his time. He died at Rome, in the year 1613.
