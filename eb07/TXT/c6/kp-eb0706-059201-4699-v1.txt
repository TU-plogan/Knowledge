CHITWAY, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Malabar. It is situated on an island twenty-seven miles long, and in some places five miles broad, and is separated from the continent by inlets of salt water, which form the northern point of an excellent inland navigation. The soil is in general poor; but it produces some rice, and a number of cocoa-nut trees, which grow on the shores. The whole is rented from the Company by the Cochin rajah for 30,000 rupees, but he is allowed no criminal jurisdiction over the inhabitants. Long. 76. 12. E. Lat. 10. 23. N.
