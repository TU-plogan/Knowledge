CLIFTON, a large parish, forming a kind of suburb to the city of Bristol, and the residence of the richest class of its inhabitants, as well as of many other opulent families. It forms a portion of the hundred of Barton Regis, in Gloucestershire, and consists of rows and crescents of handsome and convenient houses; while from its picturesque situation, and the purity of its air, it is much frequented by occasional visitors. The inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 6981, in 1821 to 8811, and in 1831 to 12,032.
