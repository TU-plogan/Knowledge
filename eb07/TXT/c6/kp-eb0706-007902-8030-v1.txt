Canes of Bengal are the most beautiful of those brought into Europe. Some of them are so fine, that people work them into bowls or vessels, which being varnished over in the inside with black or yellow lacca, arc capable of containing liquors as well as glass or china ware, and the Indians use them for that purpose.
