CASTELLAN, the name of a dignity or function in Poland. The castellans were senators of the kingdom, but senators only of the lower class, who, in diets, sat on low seats, behind the palatines or great senators. They were a kind of lieutenants of provinces, and commanded a part of the palatinate under the palatine.
