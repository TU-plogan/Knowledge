CHISME, or Cisme, the ancient Cystus, a sea-port of Anatolia, in Asiatic Turkey, separated by a narrow strait from the island of Scio. It is distinguished by a victory gained by the Russian over the Turkish fleet in 1770, and in ancient times by that gained over Antiochus by the Persians, in the 191st year before the Christian era. It is forty miles north of Smyrna.
