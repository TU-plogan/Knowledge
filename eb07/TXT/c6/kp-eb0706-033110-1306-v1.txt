CHARON, in fabulous history, the son of Erebus and Nox, whose office was to ferry the souls of the deceased over the waters of Acheron, for which each soul had to pay a piece of money. For this reason the Pagans had a custom of putting a piece of money into the mouth of the dead, in order that they might have something to pay Charon for their passage.
