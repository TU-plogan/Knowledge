CLIMACTERIC (from climacter, a ladder) signifies, among physicians, a critical year in a personâ€™s life.

According to some, this is every seventh year; but others admit only the years produced by multiplying seven by the odd numbers three, five, seven, and nine, to be cli-macterieal. These years, they say, bring with them some remarkable change with respect to health, life, or fortune. The grand climacteric is the sixty-third year; but some, making two, add to this the cighty-first. The other remarkable climaeterics are the seventh, twenty-first, thirtyfifth, forty-ninth, and fifty-sixth.
