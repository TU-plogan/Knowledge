CAVERY, or Cauvery, a river of Hindustan, in the province of Tanjore, which rises among the Coory Hills, near the coast of Malabar, and passing through the Mysore near Seringapatam, Coimbetoor, and the Carnatic, below the Ghauts, falls into the sea by several mouths, after a winding course of nearly 400 miles. Opposite to Trichinopoly, in the Carnatic, the Cavery is divided into two branches, and forms the island of Seringham. The northern branch is named the Coleroon, and is allowed to run waste into the sea; but the southern, which is, strictly speaking, the Cavery, has been distributed in a variety of channels, by the skill and industry of the Hindus, into the province of Tanjore, and this is one of the causes of its extraordinary fertility.
