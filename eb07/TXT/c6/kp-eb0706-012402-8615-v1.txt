CAPITULUM, in the ancient military art, a transverse beam, wherein were holes,through which passed the strings whereby the arms of huge engines, as balistae, catapultae, and scorpions, were played or worked.

Capitulum, in ecclesiastical writers, denoted part of a chapter of the Bible read and explained. In this sense they said, ire ad capitulum, to go to a lecture. Afterwards the place or apartment where such theological exercises were performed was denominated domus capituli.
