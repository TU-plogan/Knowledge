CALOGERI, in Ecclesiastical History, monks of the Greek church, divided into three degrees; the novices, called archam; the ordinary professed, called michrochemi ; and the more perfect, called megalochemi. They are likewise divided into coenobites, anchorites, and recluses. The coenobites are employed in reciting their offices from midnight to sunset; they are obliged to make three genuflexions at the door of the choir, and, returning, to bow to the right and to the left, to their brethren.
