CANTIMARONS, Catimarons, or Catamarans, a kind of floats or rafts, used by the inhabitants of the coast of Coromandel to go a fishing in, and to trade along the coast. They are made of three or four small eanoes, or trunks of trees dug hollow, and tied together with cacao ropes, with a triangular sail in the middle, made of mats. The persons who manage them are almost half in the water, there being only a place in the middle a little raised, to hold their merchandise; which last particular is only to be understood of the trading catamarans, and not of those that go a fishing.
