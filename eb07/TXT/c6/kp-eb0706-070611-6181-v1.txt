CITADINESCA, a name given by some writers to the Florentine marble, which is supposed to represent towns, palaces, ruins, rivers, and the like. These delineations are merely accidental, and are commonly much assisted by the imagination, though the natural lines of a stone may sometimes luckily enough represent the ruins of some ancient building, or the course of a river. In England there is a kind of septaria, or ludus Helmontii, which has sometimes beautiful, though irregular, delineations of this kind. The Florentine marble, as we see it wrought up in the ornaments of cabinets and the like, owes a great deal to the skill of the workmen, who always pick out the proper pieces from the mass, and dispose them in the work so as to represent what they please.
