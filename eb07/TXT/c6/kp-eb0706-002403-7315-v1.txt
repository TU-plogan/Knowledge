CALISTA, in fabulous history, the daughter of Lycaon, king of Arcadia, and one of the nymphs of Diana. Being beloved by Jupiter, that god assumed the form of the goddess of chastity, by which means he debauched her; but her disgrace being revealed as she was bathing with her patroness, the incensed deity turned her and the child with which she was pregnant into bears; when Jupiter, in compassion for her sufferings, took them up into the heavens and made tlÎ¹em the constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor.
