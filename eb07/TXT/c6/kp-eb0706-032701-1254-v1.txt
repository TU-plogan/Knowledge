CHARISIA, in the Heathen Theology, a wake or night festival instituted in honour of the Graees. It continued during the whole night, most of whieh was spent in dancing; and after the ballet, cakes made of yellow flour mixed with honey, and other sweetmeats, were distributed among the assistants. Charisia is also sometimes used to signify the sweetmeats distributed on such occasions.
