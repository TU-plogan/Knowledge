CASTRIES, Bay of, is situated on the east coast of Chinese Tartary, in the Channel or Gulf of Tartary, which separates that part of the continent from the island or peninsula of Saghalien. The sea is constantly covered with fogs, and various kinds of volcanic substances are abundant on the shores, and amongst the islets at the entrance of the bay. The country is covered with wood, and the inhabitants are thinly scattered. They are of a very short stature, and feeble in their frame, with shrill voices. Their principal subsistence is salmon, which they devour raw with extreme avidity. They are ignorant of agriculture, and occasionally collect wild roots for their subsistence.
