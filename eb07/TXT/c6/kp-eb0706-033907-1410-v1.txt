CHAZINZARIANS, a sect of heretics who appeared in Armenia in the seventh century. The word is formed of the Armenian chazus, cross. They were also called staurolatrce, which in Greek signifies the same as Chazin-zariαηs in Armenian, namely, adorers of the cross, because they were charged with paying adoration to the cross alone. In other respects they were Neðtorians, and admitted two persons in Jesus Christ. Nicephorus ascribes other singularities to this sect, particularly their holding an annual feast in memory of the dog of their false prophet Sergius, which they called artzibartzes.
