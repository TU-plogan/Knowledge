CHANNA, in Zoology, the name of a fish caught in great plenty in the Mediterranean, and brought to market in Italy and elsewhere, among the sea perch, which it so nearly resembles, that it would not be distinguishable, were it not that the sea perch is bigger, and has only broad transverse lines on its back, whereas the channa has both transverse and longitudinal lines.
