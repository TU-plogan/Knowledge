CHEPSTOW, a market-town of the hundred of Caldi-cott, in the county of Monmouth. It is built on the river Wye, over which is a bridge, where the tide rises higher than at any spot in England. It is a place of considerable trade, but especially for ship timber and oak bark, lt has a market on Saturday, well attended. The views on the Wye, especially from Piercefield, are very attractive, as are the picturesque scenery of the river. Chepstow was formerly walled, and had a strong castle, which is now in a dilapidated state. The population amounted in 1811 to 2381, in 1821 to 3008, and in 1831 to 3524.
