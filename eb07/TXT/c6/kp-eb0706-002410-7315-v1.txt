CALLAN, a town of Ireland, in the county of Kilkenny, situated on the banks of Kingâ€™s River. It consists of four streets intersecting each other at right angles. The church, once a stately fabric, is now nearly in ruins. On the east side of the town are the remains of an abbey which was founded in the fifteenth century, and consisted of fine architecture. Distillation is the only branch of industry of any consequence carried on here. Callan is an ancient place, and received certain privileges from the Earl of Marashall as far back as the year 1217. In 1821 the population amounted to 5678.
