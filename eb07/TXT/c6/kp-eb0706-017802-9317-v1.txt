CARROUSAL, a course of horses and chariots, or a magnificent entertainment exhibited by princes on some public rejoicing. It consists in a cavalcade of several gentlemen, richly dressed and equipped after the manner of ancient cavaliers, divided into squadrons, meeting in some public place, and practising jousts, tournaments, and the like. The last carrousals were in the reign of Louis XIV. The word comes from the Italian word carosello, a diminutive of carro, a chariot. Tertullian ascribes the invention of carrousals to Circe, and states that they were instituted in honour of the sun, her father; whence some derive the word from carrus, or carrus solis. The Moors introduced ciphers, liveries, and other ornaments of arms, with trappings, &c. for their horses; the Goths added crests, plumes, &c.
