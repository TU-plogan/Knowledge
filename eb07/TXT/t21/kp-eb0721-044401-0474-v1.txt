TZULIM, or Tchulimm, a river of Asiatic Russia, which runs through the province of Kolivan, and hills into the Yenisei. Its course is through a poor and desolate country, with scarcely a house or an inhabitant, but only tall pine* rising like pyramids, and spreading their branches so wide ns to render the woods almost impassableÂ· The only inhabitants are Tartars, who are sunk in the lowest state of barbarism.
