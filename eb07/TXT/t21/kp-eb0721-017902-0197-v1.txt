TENCE, a city of France, in the department of the Upper Loire, and in the arrondissement of Issengeaux. It stands on the river Lignon, where the Serigoul falls into it. The country around it is mountainous and thinly peopled, nor are there any large towns near it. There are some coal-mines worked in the neighbourhood. In 1S36 the city contained 5730 inhabitants, some of whom find employment in making linen goods, silk goods, and lace. There are also manufactures of leather and iron ware.
