TATTERSHALL, an English market-town, in the hundred of Gartree and division of Lindsey, in the county of Lincoln, 127 miles from London and fourteen to the north-west of Boston. It is on the Bain, a river that is navigable to the Withan, into which it flows in its way to the sea. The church, which was formerly collegiate, is a very beautiful and spacious edifice, in the form of a cross; but has suffered from time, and from the outrages of the civil wars. The population amounted in 1831 to 599.
