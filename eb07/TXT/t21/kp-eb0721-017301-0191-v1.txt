TEMPE, a spot in Greece, of great celebrity for its beauty among the ancient Greeks. It is a valley about seven miles long, and varying in breadth from 100 to 2000 feet, being the passage between the mountains of Ossa and Olympus, leading from Thessaly to Macedonia. According to tradition, this opening was made by an earthquake. The river Peneus flows through it on its way to Salonica, where it empties its waters into the sea. A modern visitor says, “the scenery of this valley fully gratified our expectations. In some places it is sylvan, calm, and harmonious, and the sound of the waters of the Peneus accords with the grace of the surrounding landscape; in others it is savage, terrific, and abrupt, and the river roars with violence, darkened by the frown of stupendous precipices.”
