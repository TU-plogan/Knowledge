TASTE, a certain sensation excited in the mind by certain bodies, which are called sapid, applied to the tongue and palate, and moistened with saliva. This is the original and proper meaning of the word taste; but as the qualities of bodies which produce these sensations are unknown, they have obtained the names of the sensations themselves, by substituting the cause for the effect. Tastes have been divided into simple and compound, and philosophers have endeavoured to ascertain the number of each species. Attempts have likewise been made to determine from their tastes the effects of different substances on the human body, taken into the stomach as food or physic; but by stating the result of such inquiries, we should be more likely to mislead than to communicate useful information.
