TAIN, a royal borough of Scotland, and the county town of Ross-shire. It is situated on the margin of the Firth of Dornoch, about a mile from the sea, in the neighbourhood of a fertile and well-cultivated country. The town is pleasant and prosperous. It is provided with an excellent academy, taught by a rector and two masters. The trade is principally confined to the demands of the town and adjoining districts. Tain unites with Cromarty, Dingwall, Dornoch, Kirkwall, and Wick, in sending a member to parliament. The population of the borough and parish in 1831 amounted to 3078, of which about 2000 belonged to the borough.
