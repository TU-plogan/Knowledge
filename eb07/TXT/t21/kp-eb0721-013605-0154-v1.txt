TEIGNMOUTH, West, a town of the hundred of Exminster, in the county of Devon, 187 miles from London. It stands on the sea-shore on Torbay, and adjoining to it, but on the opposite side of the river Teign, is East Teignmouth, a smaller and not a market-town. Both united form one of the most favourite resorts for sea-bathers on this coast, and it is frequently inhabited during the winter by persons afflicted with or apprehensive of pulmonary complaints. They are separate parishes, each having its church; and West Teignmouth has a good market on Saturdays. The country around is healthy and picturesque, and provisions are cheap. The population of West Teignmouth amounted in 1821 to 2514, and in 1831 to 2878; that of the other town in 1821 to 1466, and in 1831 to 1810.
