TERRE Napoleon, a tract of coast on the south shore of New Holland, first explored by the French navigator Captain Baudin in Le GÃ©ographe. According to Captain Flinders, it is comprised between Lat. 37.36. and 35.40. S. and between Long. 140. 10. and 138. 58. E. making about fifty leagues of coast, in which, Captain Baudin observes, there is neither river, inlet, nor place of shelter; and it has, besides, an appearance of extreme barrenness.
