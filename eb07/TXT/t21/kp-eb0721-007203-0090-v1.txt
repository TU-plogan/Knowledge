TAMAN, an island in the Russian province of Taurida, at the entrance of the Sea of Azoph from the Black Sea. Though properly a peninsula, it is made an island by the overflowings of the river Kuban, but which at some seasons are quite dried up. The strait of Taman is a narrow and dangerous passage leading to Taganrog, having in some places no more than thirteen feet of water. This strait, sometimes called the Strait of Yenicaleh, is defended by a powerful fort. Part of the island is low, but it contains a number of small hills of volcanic origin, from one of which there was an eruption in July 1804. There are three towns on the island. Taman, or Fanagoria, on the south-east, is a place of some trade, and is defended by a fort; Kertch, on the opposite side, stands at the foot of a steep hill, and contains about 1000 inhabitants, chiefly Greek fishermen and Jews; and Yenicaleh, beyond Kertch, contains a population of 2000 persons, and has a strong citadel. It stands in long. 36. 35. E. and lat. 45. 21. 30. N.
