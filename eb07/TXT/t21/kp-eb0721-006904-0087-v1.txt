TADCASTER, a town in the wapentake of Barkston-Ash, in the west riding of the county of York, 185 miles from London. It stands on the river Wharfe, over which is a fine bridge, built from the ruins of its ancient castle, called by the Romans Calcaria, from the abundance of limestone found near it. It is a well-built town, with a well-attended market on Thursday. The inhabitants amounted in 1821 to 1651, and in 1831 to 1666.
