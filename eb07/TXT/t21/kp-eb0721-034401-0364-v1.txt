TRANENT, a market-town in the county of Haddington, nine miles and a half from Edinburgh. It consists of one long street, through which the principal road to Berwick passes, and several minor by-streets, to none of which can be given the praise of being either handsome or clean. The houses are chiefly inhabited by colliers, who are employed in the extensive mines which have been worked here for several centuries. There is a weekly market for grain. The population of the town and parish in 1831 amounted to 3620.
