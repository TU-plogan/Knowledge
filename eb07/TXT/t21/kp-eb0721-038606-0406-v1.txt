TRING, a market-town of England, in the hundred of Dacorum and county of Hertford, thirty-one miles from London. It is a neatly built place, with some good houses. The church is a fine venerable Gothic structure, with a square tower; and in the chancel are some very fine monuments. It has also an endowed charity-school. There is a well-supplied market on Friday. This town is on the great road to Buckingham, and is in contact with the Grand Junction Canal, and with the London and Birmingham railroad, which last has a station here for taking up and setting down passengers. From this arrangement a great increase is anticipated, both in houses and inhabitants. The inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 1847, in 1821 to 3286. and in 1831 to 3488
