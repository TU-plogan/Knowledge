TILBURY, a village of the hundred of Barnstaple, in the county of Essex. It is only remarkable for the strong fortifications constructed there to command the course of the river Thames. It contains a regular work, which can be surrounded by water, and has more than 100 cannon, from twenty-four to forty-eight pounders, directed towards the stream. It is nearly opposite to Gravesend in Kent, on a bend of the river. Near it are the vestiges of the camp formed by Queen Elizabeth at the time of the expected invasion by the Spanish Armada. The population in 1821 amounted to 249, and in 1831 to 276.
