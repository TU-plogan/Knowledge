THURSO, a seaport town, borough of barony, and parish on the north-west side of the county of Caithness. The town is situated on the river Thurso, which here falls into the bay of the same name, and by it is divided into two parts. The old portion of the town is irregularly built and ill paved; hut the new part is built on a regular plan, and contains a better class of houses, with a handsome new church, town-house, and other buildings for carrying on the public business connected with the customs, excise, and banking. The harbour will only admit vessels of ten feet draught of water at stream tides; the entrance is also much obstructed by a bar, and, for want of a pier or breastwork of stone, vessels, after getting over the bar, can only unload or load at low water. Besides this inconvenience, the bay of Thurso is too dangerous to admit of its ever being a resort for shipping. Notwithstanding these disadvantages, there is a considerable coasting trade, and the inhabitants of the town and immediate neighbourhood are extensively engaged in fisheries, tanning, bleaching, and spinning. Thurso is a place of great antiquity, but was not erected into a borough of barony until the year 1633, when Charles I. granted a charter with the usual powers and privileges. It is governed by two bailies, a dean of guild, and twelve councillors. The population of the town amounted in 1831 to about 2700, and of the parish to 4679.
