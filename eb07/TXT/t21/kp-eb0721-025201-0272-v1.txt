THORNHILL, a large and thriving village in the parish of Morton and county of Dumfries, is delightfully situated in a vale through which runs the river Nith. It consists of a few streets, having in the centre a cross, erected by the last duke of Queensberry. It has of late been much improved by the proprietor, the present duke of Buccleuch, who has had the streets levelled and paved, common sewers formed, and a good supply of water brought in. It contains two dissenting places of worship. It possesses also a branch of one of the Edinburgh banks, and a subscription library established in 1814. In 1831 the population amounted to 1373.
