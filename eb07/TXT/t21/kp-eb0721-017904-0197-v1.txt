TENEDOS, in Ancient Geography, an island on the coast of Troas, at the distance of forty stadia from the continent, and eighty in compass; with a cognominal Aeolian town, and a temple of Apollo Smintheus. Its origin is derived from Tennes or Tenes, who being exposed in a coffer or bog by bis father Cygnus the Thracian, at the instigation of the mother-in-law, was by fate carried to this island, made king of it, and at length worshipped as a god on account of his virtues.
