TSIOMPA, a country of Eastern Asia, between Cambodia and Cochin China, and now subjected to the latter kingdom. The country properly called Tsiompa is harren, intensely hot, and very unhealthy during a great part of the year. It however produces a little cotton, indigo, and silk, though of inferior quality. The inhabitants are tall, strongly made, of a reddish complexion, with the nose somewhat flattened.
