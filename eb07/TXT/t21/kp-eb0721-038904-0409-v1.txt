TRONAGE, an ancient customary duty or toll, for the weighing of wool. According to Fleta, trona is a beam to weigh with, mentioned in the stat. Westm. 2, cap. 25. And tronage was used for the weighing of wool in a staple or public mart, by a common trona or beam; which, for the tronage of wool in London, was fixed at Leadenhall. The mayor and commonalty of London were ordained keepers of the beams and weights for weighing merchantsâ€™ commodities, with power to assign clerks and porters, &c. of the great beam and balance; which weighing of goods and wares is called tronage; and on pain of forfeiture, no stranger was to buy any goods in London before they were weighed at the king's beam.
