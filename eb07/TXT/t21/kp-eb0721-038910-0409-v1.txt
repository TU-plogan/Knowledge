TROSACHS, the name given to that romantic glen which separates Loch Kateran (Katrine) from Loch Ach-ray, in the Western Highlands of Perthshire. The name signifies in Gaelic the Bristled Territory; a signification perfectly applicable to the confused mass of abrupt crags which, in some convulsion of nature, has been separated from the neighbouring mountains of Ben Vennu and Ben-An. These crags are of the most extraordinary and fantastic forms; and being covered with a profusion of trees and shrubs the diversity of hues which they yield, mixed with the shades of the deep ravines, and the highly picturesque and wooded acclivity of the lofty Ben-An, gives a depth and wildness to the pass, not to be equalled, it is supposed, in the world. This rugged and narrow defile is about one mile and a half in length, and was first rendered an object of popular attention by Sir Walter Scott, in his poem of the Lady of the Lake. The modern road for the use of tourists, which passes through it, has in a great degree marred its solitude.
