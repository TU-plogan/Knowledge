TEDDINGTON, a town, or rather a village, in the hundred of Spelthorne and county of Middlesex, twelve miles from London. It is delightfully placed on the banks of the Thames, at the spot where the tide ceases to flow, from which circumstance the name has been given to the place. It has a neat parish church; and within the parish are many splendid houses and a great number of country retreats for the inhabitants of the metropolis. Bushy Park, which adjoins it, is an attractive object, affording pleasing promenades and rides. The population in 1821 amounted to 863, and in 1831 to 895.
