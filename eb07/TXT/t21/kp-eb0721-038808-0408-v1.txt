TRIUMVIR, one of three persons who govern absolutely, and with equal authority, in a state. It is chiefly applied to the Roman government. Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, were the first triumvirs, who divided the government among them. There were also other officers so called; as the triumviri or tresviri capitales, who were the keepers of the public gaol. They had the office of punishing malefactors, for which purpose they employed eight lictors.
