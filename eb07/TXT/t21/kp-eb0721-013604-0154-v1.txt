TEHINCHIEN, a river of Hindustan, in the province of Bootan, which runs past Tassisudon, the capital; and being augmented by the tributary streams of the Hatchieu and Patcheiu, forces a passage through the mountains, whence it is precipitated into tremendous cataracts, and rushing with a rapid torrent between the high cliffs and vast rocks which oppose its progress, it pursues its course into the open plains near Buxedwar, and finally joins the Brahmapootra.
