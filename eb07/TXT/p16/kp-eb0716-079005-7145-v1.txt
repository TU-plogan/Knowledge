PANTALOON, a sort.of garment consisting of breeches and stockings of one piece, and said to have been first introduced by the Venetians.

Pantaloon, in the theatre, is a buffoon or masked person, who performs high and grotesque dances, and shows violent and extravagant postures and airs. The word is likewise used for the habit or dress which these buffoons usually wear, and which is made precisely to fit the body, being all of a piece from head to foot.
