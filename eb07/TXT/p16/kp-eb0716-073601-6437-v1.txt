PAITA, or Payta, a town of Peru, in the department of Truxillo. It stands on a bay of the same name, situated in 5.2. of south latitude. A hard sandy beach extends round the harbour, which is completely sheltered from all prevailing winds. The port is a rendezvous for American whale-ships. It is the seaport of Piura, fourteen leagues in the interior, and carries on a considerable coasting trade. The exports from Paita are cinchona, rhatany, silver, and wool. This town has suffered as much from the invasions of the buccaneers as any port of the Pacific. It was also burned by Lord Anson in 1741, and by Lord Cochrane in 1810; yet the importance of its position has always led to its reconstruction. The population amounts to about 3000.
