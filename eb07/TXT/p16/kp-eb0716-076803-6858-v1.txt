PALINGENIUS, Marcellus, an Italian poet, well known by a poem divided into twelve books, and entitled Zodiacus Vitae, which occupied him several years in composing, and dedicated to Hercules II. of Este, duke of Ferrara. Some say he was a physician to that prince; others rank him amongst the learned Lutherans, to whom the Duchess of Ferrara gave a reception in her court, and honoured with her protection. His Zodiac contains good things, and is a philosophical satire against immorality and false prejudices. Of the authorâ€™s life, however, little is known. He died some time between the years 1537 and 1543.
