PALATINE, or Count Palatine, a title anciently given to all persons who had any office or employment in the princeâ€™s palace, but afterwards conferred on those delegated by princes to hold courts of justice in the provinces, and on such amongst the lords as had a palace, that is, a court of justice, in their own houses.

Palatine-Games, in Roman antiquity, were games instituted in honour of Augustus by his wife Livia, after he had been enrolled amongst the gods. They were celebrated in the palace, whence the name, and were confirmed by the succeeding emperors. Some authors say that these games were instituted in honour of Julius Caesar, and others again confound them with the Ludi Augustales; but neither of these opinions seems to be well supported.
