PAeAN, amongst the ancient pagans, was a song of rejoicing sung in honour of Apollo, and chiefly used on occasions of victory and triumph.

Paean, in the ancient poetry, is a foot consisting of four syllables, of which there are four kinds; the paean primus, secundus, tertius, and quartus. The paean primus consists of one long syllable and three short ones, or a trochaeus and pyrrhichius, as temporibus ; the paean secundus consists of a short syllable, a long, and two short, or an iambus and a pyrrhichius, as potentia ; the paean tertius consists of two short syllables, with a long and a short one, or a pyrrhichius and a trochaeus, as animatus ; and the paean quartus consists of three short syllables and a long one, or a pyrrhichius and iambus, as celeritas.
