PALAWAN Isle, a large island in the Eastern Seas, estimated at 275 miles in length, and thirty-two miles in average breadth. It stands between the northern extremity of Borneo, with which and the Philippines it forms an extensive chain of islands. The country is described as being flat to the bottom of the hills. Its productions are cowries, wax, tortoise-shell, and sea-slug or biche de mer, the last being abundant. It contains much ebony and laka-wood; also hot springs and mines of gold.
