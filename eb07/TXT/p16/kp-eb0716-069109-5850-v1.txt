PADUAN, amongst medallists, a modern medal struck in imitation of the antique, or a new medal struck with all the marks and characters of antiquity. This name is properly applicable to those medals only which were struck in the seventh century by an Italian painter born at Padua, who succeeded so well in the imposture, that the best judges are at a loss to distinguish his medals from the genuine ones; but it is also used to signify all medals of this kind.
