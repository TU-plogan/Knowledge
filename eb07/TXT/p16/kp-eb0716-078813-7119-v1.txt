PANEGYRICUM, in church history, an ecclesiastical book, used by the Greek church, containing the panegyrical orations of various authors, on the solemnities of Jesus Christ and the saints. It is found in manuscript in most churches, but it is not the same in all, each church having its particular saints; indeed the compilers of this kind of books usually suited their collections to the taste of their own devotion. They are disposed according to the order of the months, and frequently consist of twelve volumes, answering to the twelve months of the year. Amongst the principal authors of this work are Athanasius, Cyril, Basil, Chrysostom, and others.
