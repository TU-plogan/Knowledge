WYNDHAM, Sir WILLIAM, descended of an ancient family, was born about the year 1687, and succeeded young to the title and estate of his father. On his return from his travels, he was chosen member for the county of Somerset, in which station he served in the three last parliaments of Queen Anne, and as long as he lived. After the change of the ministry in 1710, he was appointed secretary at war; and in 1713 was raised to be chancellor of the exchequer. Upon the breach between the earl of Oxford and Lord Bolingbroke, he adhered to the interests of the latter. He was removed from his employment on the accession of George I., and falling under suspicion on the breaking out of the rebellion in 1715, was apprehended. He made his escape; a reward was published for apprehending him; he surrendered, was committed to the Tower, but never brought to a trial. After he regained his liberty, he continued in opposition to the several administrations under which he lived, and died in 1740.
