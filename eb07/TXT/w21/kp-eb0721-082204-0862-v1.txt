WAYWODE is a title formerly given to the governors of the chief places in the dominions of the czar of Muscovy. The palatines or governors of provinces in Poland also bore the quality of waywodes or waiwodes. The Poles likewise called the princes of Wallachia and Moldavia waywodes, as esteeming them no other than on the footing of governors, pretending that Wallachia and Moldavia are provinces of Poland. Everywhere else these are called hospodars. Du Cange says, that the name waywode is used in Dalmatia, Croatia, and Hungary, for a general of an army; and Leunclavius, in his Pandects of Turkey, tells us it usually signifies captain or commander.
