WEST-BROMWICH, a parish of the county of Stafford, in the hundred of Offlow, 122 miles from London. It is a very scattered place, and affords considerable occupation in various branches of the iron manufacture. Besides the old parish church, two others have been recently erected. The population amounted in 1821 to 9505, and in 1831 to 15,327.
