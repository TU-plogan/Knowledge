WATCHET, a market-town of the county of Somerset, in the hundred of Willerton and Freemanners, 158 miles from London. It is a seaport, situated on the Bristol Channel, but its harbour has been much neglected; and though means have been taken to improve it, small vessels only can enter it. Watchet was formerly a place of repute for making a kind of coarse cloth, well known in the western counties by the name of the place. It is in summer visited for the purpose of sea-bathing. It is within and forms the chief part of the parish of St Deucemans, whose population amounted in 1821 to 1865, and in 1831 to 2120.
