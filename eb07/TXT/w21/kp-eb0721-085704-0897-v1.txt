WELLINGTON, a market-town in the county of Somerset and hundred of West Kingsbury, on the river Tone, 150 miles from London and seven from Taunton. It is in a rich district, is well built, has an ancient noble church, and a new one recently erected at the sole expense of the clergyman. The town formerly had a considerable trade in making serges and other woollen goods, but that branch of industry has greatly declined of late years. Some pottery ware is made. There is a well-frequented market on Thursday. The population amounted in 1821 to 4170, and in 1831 to 4762.
