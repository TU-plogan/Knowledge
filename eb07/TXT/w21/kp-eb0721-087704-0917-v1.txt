WHITSUNTIDE Bay, the passage which separates the islands of Kodiak and St Hermogenes, which lie about sixty miles from the entrance of Cookâ€™s Inlet, in the North Pacific Ocean. It was so called by Cook, who was not aware that the land was here divided into two islands, and what he supposed to be a bay was the strait by which they were separated.
