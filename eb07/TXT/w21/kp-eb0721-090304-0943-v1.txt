WINTER, one of the four seasons or quarters of the year. Winter commences on the day when the sunâ€™s distance from the zenith of the place is greatest, and ends on the day when its distance is at a mean between the greatest and least. Under the equator, the winter, as well as other seasons, returns twice every year, but all other places have only one annual winter; which in the northern hemisphere begins when the sun is in the tropic of Capricorn, and in the southern hemisphere when in the tropic of Cancer; so that all places in the same hemisphere have their winter at the same time.
