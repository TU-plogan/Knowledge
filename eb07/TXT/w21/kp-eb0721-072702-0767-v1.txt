WALLUBGHUR, a hill-fortress of Hindustan, in the Mahratta territories, in the province of Bejapore and district of Darwar. It was long in possession of the Mahratta chief Purseram Bhow. On his death it was occupied by the Colapoor rajah, in whose possession it remained until 1804, when, by the interposition of the British, it was restored to the peshwa, and is now held by one of his feudatories.
