WANDIWASH, a town and fortress of the south of India, in the province of the Carnatic. In 1759, the British were repulsed in an attack on this place; but in November following, it was taken by Sir Eyre Coote, with scarcely any loss. It was the scene of a decisive battle, in January 1760, between the French under Îœ. Lally, and the British under Colonel Coote, with their respective allies, in which the former were totally defeated. The fortress was demolished, by order of General Stuart, in 1783. The town, with the adjoining territory, is now included in the Arcot collectorship. It is sixty-four miles south-west of Madras. Long. 79. 40. E. Lat. 12. 20. N.
