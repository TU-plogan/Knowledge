WAVE, in Philosophy, water, or any other fluid, raised above the general level of the surface.

The waves of the sea are of two kinds, natural and accidental. The natural waves are those which are exactly proportioned in size to the strength of the wind, whose blowing gives origin to them. The accidental waves are those occasioned by the windâ€™s re-acting upon itself by repercussion from hills and mountains, or high shores, and by the washing of the waves themselves, otherwise of the natural kind, against rocks and shoals: all these causes give the waves an elevation which they can never have in their natural state.
