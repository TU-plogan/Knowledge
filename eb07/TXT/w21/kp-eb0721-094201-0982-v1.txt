WORMS, an ancient city of Germany, now in the principality of Hesse-Darmstadt and province of the Rhine, and the capital of the bailiwick of its own name, ft stands on the Rhine, where the Eisbach falls into that river. It is surrounded with ancient and untenable fortifications, and is much reduced from the condition it once exhibited when it was an imperial city. It contains two Catholic, two Lutheran, and one reformed church, 910 houses, and 8100 inhabitants. It has some trade by the river and at its fairs, but chiefly in the products of the district. It is more remarkable for its antiquities and the historical recollections which it recalls. It was the seat of frequent diets of the empire. Long. 8. 15. 7. E. Lat. 49. 37. 49. N.
