MOLA, a city of the kingdom of Naples, in the province of Bari. It stands on the sea-shore, but has no good haven. It contains 7664 inhabitants, many of whom are occupied in the fisheries, and others in the cultivation of vines and olive trees.

Mola Salsa, in Antiquity, was barley parched, and afterwards ground to meal or flour, after which it was mixed with salt and frankincense, with the addition of a little water. Thus prepared, it was sprinkled between the horns of the victim before it was killed in sacrifice. This act was called immolatio, and was common to both Greeks and Romans; with this difference, that the rnola of the Romans was of wheat.
