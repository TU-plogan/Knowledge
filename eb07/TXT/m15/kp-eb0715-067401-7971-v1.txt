MYSTICAL, something mysteriousor allegorical. Some of the commentators on the sacred writings, besides a literal, discover also a mystical meaning. The sense of Scripture, say they, is either that immediately signified by the words and expressions in the common use of language; or it is mediate, sublime, typical, and mystical. The literal sense they again divide into properly literal, which is contained in the words taken simply and properly; and metaphorically literal, where the words are to be taken in a figurative and metaphorical sense. The mystical sense of Scripture they divide into three kinds; the first corresponding to faith, and called allegorical; the second to hope, called anagogical; and the third to charity, called the tro-pological sense. And sometimes they take the same word in Scripture in all the four senses. Thus the word Jerusalem literally signifies the capital of Judaea; allegorically, the church militant; tropologically, a believer; and anagogically, heaven. So, the passage in Genesis, “Let there be light, and there was light,” literally signifies corporeal light; by an allegory, the Messiah; in the tropolo-gical sense, grace; and anagogically, beatitude, or the light of glory.
