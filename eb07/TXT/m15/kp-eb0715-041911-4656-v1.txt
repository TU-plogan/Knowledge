MONOTHELITES (compounded of μονος, single, and ⅜ε ∖ ημα, will, from 3eλω, volo, I will), an ancient sect, which sprung out of the Eutychians, and were so called from allowing only one will in Jesus Christ. The opinion of the Monothelites took its rise in 630, and had the Emperor Heraclius for an adherent; it was the same with that of the Acephalous Severians. They allowed of two wills in Christ, considered with regard to the two natures, but reduced them to one, by reason of the union of these natures, thinking it absurd that there should be two free wills in one and the same person. They were condemned by the sixth general council in 680, as being supposed to destroy the perfection of the humanity of Jesus Christ, by depriving it of will and operation. Their sentiments were afterwards embraced by the Maronites.
