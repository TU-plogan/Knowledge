MUNICIPIUM, in Roman antiquity, a corporation borough, or enfranchised city or town, where the inhabitants enjoyed their own laws and customs, and at the same time were honoured with the privileges of Roman citizens. But this privilege generally extended no farther than the bare title. Some indeed, by particular merit, obtained the liberty of votes, which occasioned the distinction of municipium sine suffragio, and municipium cum suffragio. The inhabitants of the municipium sine suffragio were called barely Romani, but those of the municipium cum suffrÎ±qio were called Cives Romam.

The difference between proper citizens of Rome and the inhabitants of the municipium or free town may be thus expressed. The proper citizens of Rome were registered in the census, had the right of suffrage and of bearing honours, were assessed in the poll-tax, served in the legions, used the Roman laws and religion, and were called Quirites and Populus Romanus; whereas the municipes enjoyed the first three of these privileges, but were denied the last three.
