MULE, a mongrel kind of quadruped, usually generated between an ass and a mare, and sometimes between a horse and a she-ass; but the signification of the word is commonly extended to every kind of animal produced by a mixture of two different species.

Mules, amongst gardeners, denote a sort of vegetable monsters produced by putting the farina fcecuηdaηs of one species of plant into the pistil or utricle of another. The carnation and sweet-william being somewhat alike in their parts, particularly their flowers, the farina of the one will impregnate the other, and the seed so enlivened will produce a plant differing from either.
