MINOR, a Latin term, literally denoting less, and used in opposition to major, greater.

Minor, in Law, denotes a person under age, or one who, by the laws of the country, has not yet arrived at the power of administering his own affairs, or the possession of his estate.

Minor, in Logic, is the second proposition of a formal or regular syllogism, called also the assumption. Minor, in Music, is applied to certain concords, which differ from or are lower than others of the same denomination, by a lesser semitone, or by four commas. Thus we say, a third minor, or lesser third, or a sixth major and minor. Concords which admit of major and minor, or greater and less, are said to be imperfect concords.
