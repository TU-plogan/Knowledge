MISERICORDIA, in Law, is an arbitrary fine imposed on any person for an offence; it is called misericordia, because the amercement ought to be but small, and less than that required by Magna Charta. If a person be outrageously amerced in a court that is not one of record, the writ called moderata misericordia lies for moderating the amercement according to the nature of the fault.
