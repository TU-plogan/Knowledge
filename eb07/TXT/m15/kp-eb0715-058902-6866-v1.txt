MUFTI, the chief of the ecclesiastical order, or primate of the Mussulman religion. The authority of the mufti is very great in the Ottoman empire; for even the sultan himself, if he would preserve any appearance of religion, cannot, without hearing his opinion, put any person to death, or so much as inflict any corporal punishment. In all actions, especially criminal ones, his opinion is required, by giving him a writing, in which the case is stated under feigned names, and which he subscribes with the words, He shall, or shall not, be punished. Such outward honour is paid to the mufti, that the grand signior himself rises up to him, and advances seven steps to meet him when he comes into his presence.
