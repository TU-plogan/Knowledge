MISITRA, or Mistra, a city of Greece, in the Morea, one of the largest in the peninsula. It is situated upon a wide plain, watered by two streams, and said to have been raised out of the ruins of ancient Sparta, which was two miles from the modern city. The country around was fertile, but has been neglected; and the population of the city has declined from 16,000 to 4000. It still produces some good silk, but is commonly considered as an unhealthy place.
