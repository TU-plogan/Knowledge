MURVIEDRO, a celebrated town of Spain, in the province of Valencia. It is at the foot of a mountain of black marble, on the ruins of the famous city of Saguntum, whose ancient theatre still exists and attests its former grandeur. It is an exact semicircle, about two hundred and fifty feet in diameter; the inner diameter, or orchestra, is twenty-four feet; the seats for the auditors, the staircases, the passages, arched porticos, and entrances, may still be accurately traced. This theatre was calculated to contain 10,000 spectators, and is the most imposing of all the monuments of very high antiquity that are left in Spain. The view from the hill behind the theatre is represented by all travellers as most delightful. The country it overlooks is fertile and verdant, being covered with trees, and studded with houses, whilst the streams of the river Palancia are diverted into numerous channels to irrigate and fructify the whole plain. The castle of Saguntum is by recent observation in east longitude from London 0.12. 45., and in north latitude 39. 40. 36. The city now contains 6810 inhabitants, a church, a castle, and three monasteries.
