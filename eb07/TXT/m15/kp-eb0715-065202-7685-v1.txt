MYOLOGY (formed of μυς, μυoς, a muscle, and λo∕oς, discourse), in anatomy, signifies a description of the muscles, or the knowledge of what relates to the muscles of the human body. See Anatomy.

Μ YOMANC Y, a kind of divination, or method of foretelling future events by means of mice. Some authors hold myomancy to be one of the most ancient kinds of divination, and think it is on this account that Isaiah (lxvi. 17) reckons mice amongst the abominable things of the idolaters. But besides that it is by no means certain that the Hebrew word *P≡P used by the prophet signifies a mouse, it is not the divination by that animal, whatever it may have been that is spoken of by the prophet, but the eating it, that is forbidden.
