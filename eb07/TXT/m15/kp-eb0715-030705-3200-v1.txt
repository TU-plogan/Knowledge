MIXTURE, a compound or assemblage of several different bodies in the same mass. Chemical mixture is attended with many phenomena which are never observed in simple mixtures; such as heat, effervescence, &c. To chemical mixture belong the union of acids and alkalies, the amalgamation of metals, the solution of gums, &c.; and upon it depend many of the principal operations of chemistry.
