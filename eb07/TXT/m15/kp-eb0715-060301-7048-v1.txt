MUSEUM, a name that originally signified a part of the palace of Alexandria, which occupied at least one fourth of the city. This quarter was called the Museum, on account of its being set apart for the worship of the Muses and the study of the sciences. Here were lodged and entertained the men of learning, who were divided into many companies or colleges,' according to the sciences of which they were the professors; and to each of these houses or colleges was allotted a handsome revenue. The foundation of this establishment is attributed to Ptolemy Philadelphus, who here placed his library. Hence the word museum is now applied to any place set apart as a repository for things which have an immediate relation to the arts.
