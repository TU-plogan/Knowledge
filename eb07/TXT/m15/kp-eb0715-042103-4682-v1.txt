MONSIEUR, in the plural Messieurs, a term or title of civility, used by the French in speaking to their equals, or those a little below them.

Monsieur, absolutely used, was a title appropriated to the second son of France, or the kingâ€™s brother. The king was also called Monsieur, but that only by the children of France.
