SALIBABO Isles, a group of islands in the Eastern Seas, situated about the fourth degree of north latitude, and between 126 and 127 of east longitude. The island of Sali-babo is about fifteen miles in circumference, and is situated to the southward of Tulour, from which it is divided by a narrow strait, about one mile across. The names of the principal islands are Tulour or Kercolang, Salibabo, and Kabruang. Salibabo contains twelve villages, the united population of which amounts to 3000. All these islands are well cultivated and populous, abounding in potatoes, rice, goats, hogs, &c. The inhabitants are of the Malay colour, with long hair; and have for arms lances, swords, targets, and daggers. They manufacture a coarse kind of cloth from the wild plantain tree. They are much oppressed by their chiefs, and sold as slaves for trifling offences. They barter provisions with such ships as pass, for coarse calicoes, red handkerchiefs, coarse cutlery, &c. There is a good harbour on the east coast of the island of Salibabo.
