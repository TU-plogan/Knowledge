SALEMI, a city of the island of Sicily, in the province of Mazzara. It stands on a healthy spot on the summit of a hill, which is the ancient Alicia or Halycus. It is surrounded with walls in a dilapidated state. It is on the decline, but still contains 9200 inhabitants, who are chiefly employed in agriculture, especially in producing the best oil, and in making excellent wire.
