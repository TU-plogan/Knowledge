SALINES, a city of France, in the department of the Jura, and arrondissement of Poligny. It is situated in a narrow valley on the river Furieuse, and is defended by two forts. In it arc some strong brine springs, from which culinary salt is prepared; but much of the brine is conducted to Arp and Senans to be granulated. Near to it some excellent wine is produced, as well as much honey and bees-wax. In 1836 it contained 6554 inhabitants.
