SANQUHAR, a royal burgh in Scotland, on the left bank of the Nith, between the counties of Dumfries and Ayr. The town most probably owes its origin to a castle of some note, the ruins of which are still extant, on a high bank overlooking the river Nith. This castle was the chief residence of the Queensberry family, before William, the first duke, built the noble mansion of Drumlanrig. It is a place of little trade. The population in 1831 was 1527. It is one of the district of burghs which jointly with Dumfries scnds a member to parliament.
