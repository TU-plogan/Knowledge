SALENGORE, a district in the Malay peninsula, extending along the Straits of Malacca, and governed by a Mahommedan chief, who bears the title of rajah. It is situated at no great distance from Prince of Walesâ€™ Island, in which the trade of the place chiefly centres. Pepper, cloves, wild nutmegs, wax, nutmeg-oil, rattans, dammer, wood, oil, &c., are imported in the Buggess prows; and from a large river near to Salengore great quantities of long rattans are brought. The prince is the chief merchant, as in the other Malay principalities, monopolizing all the trade. Ships lying in the river are secure from pirates; but in the road it is necessary to be on the alert against straggling prows, which are always ready to take advantage of unguarded ships. The Buggesses have still a small settlement here, and profess the Mahommedan religion.
