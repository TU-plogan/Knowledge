SATYAVRATA, or MeNÃ¼, in Indian mythology, is believed by the Hindus to have reigned over the whole world in the earliest age of their chronology, and to have resided in the country of Dravira, on the coast of the eastern Indian peninsula. His patronymic name was Vaivaswata, or Child of the Sun. Sir William Jones has shown it to be in the highest degree probable, that the Satyavrata of India is the Kronus of Greece and the Saturn of Italy. See Saturn, and Asiatic Researches, vol. i. p. 230.
