SADRAS, a town of Southern India, in the Carnatic, on the sea-coast. It was formerly a small village, which was purchased by the Dutch about the middle of the seventeenth century; and under their protection it grew up into a populous place, the seat of a flourishing manufacture of ginghams of a superior quality. It was surrounded by them with a brick wall fifteen feet in height, and close to the sea. The fort was seized by the French general Lally in the year 1759, while the French were besieging Madras, though the Dutch were neutral in the war. It was afterwards restored to Holland, and was finally taken possession of by the British in 1795. The town has now fallen into a state of decay. At a short distance are some hills, on which are situated seven Hindu temples, held in great estimation. Long. 80. 16. E. Lat. 12. 27. N.
