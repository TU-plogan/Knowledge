SCHOLIUM, a note, annotation, or remark, occasionally made on some passage, proposition, or the like. This term is much used in geometry and other parts of mathematics, where, after demonstrating a proposition, it is customary to point out how it might be done some other way, or to give some advice or precaution in order to prevent mistakes, or add some particular use or application thereof.
