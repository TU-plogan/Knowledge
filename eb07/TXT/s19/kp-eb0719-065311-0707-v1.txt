SATYRS, in ancient mythology, a species of demi-gods, who dwelt in the woods. They are represented as monsters, half men and half goats; having horns on their heads, and a hairy body, with the feet and tail of a goat. They are generally delineated in the train that follows Bacchus. As the poets supposed that they were remarkable for piercing eyes and keen raillery, they have placed them in the same pictures with the Graces, Loves, and even with Venus herself.
