SAMUEL, Books of, two canonical books of the Old Testament, being usually ascribed to the prophet Samuel. The books of Samuel and the books of Kings are a continued history of the reigns of the kings of Israel and Judah; for which reason the books of Samuel are likewise styled the first and second books of Kings. Since the first twenty-four chapters contain all that relates to the history of Samuel, and the latter part of the first book and all the second include the relation of events that happened after the death of that prophet, it has been supposed that Samuel was author only of the first twenty-four chapters, and that the prophets Gad and Nathan finished the work. The first book of Samuel comprehends the transactions under the government of Eli and Samuel, and under Saul, the first king, and also the acts of David whilst he lived under Saul; and is supposed to contain the space of a hundred and one years. The second book contains the history of about forty years, and is wholly spent in relating the transactions of Davidâ€™s reign.
