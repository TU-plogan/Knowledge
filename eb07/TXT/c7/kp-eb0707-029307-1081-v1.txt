CONTOURNIATED, a term among antiquaries applied to medals, the edges of which appear as if turned in a lathe. This sort of work seems to have had its origin in Greece, and to have been designed to perpetuate the memories of great men, particularly those who had borne away the prize at the solemn games. Such arc those of Homer, Solon, Euclid, Pythagoras, Socrates, and of several atliletae.
