CUSPINIAN, John, a German, whose native name was Speishammer, was born at Sweinfurt in 1473, and died at Vienna in 1529. He was first physician to the Emperor Maximilian I. and employed by that prince in several delicate n√©gociations. We have of his, in Latin, 1. A History of the Roman emperors from Julius Caesar to the death of Maximilian I. which Wheare, in his Methodus Legendes Historice, calls luculentum sane opus, et omnium lectione dignissimum, 1519, fol.; 2. A History of Austria, being a continuation of the preceding, Basil, 1553, fol.; 3. A History of the origin of the Turks, and of their cruelties towards Christians, Antwerp, 1541, 8vo; and some other works. Gerard Vossius calls Cuspinian magnum suo cevo historice lumen.
