COMPLEMENT, in Geometry, is what remains of the quadrant of a circle, or 90°, after any given arch has been taken away from it. Thus, if the arch taken away be 40°, its complement is 50; because 50 + 40=90. The sine of the complement of an arch is called the cosine, and that of the tangent the cotangent, and so on.
