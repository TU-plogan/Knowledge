CYNOSARGES, a place in the suburbs of Athens, so named from a white or swift dog, who snatched away part of the sacrifice being offered to Hercules. It had Ã¥ gymnasium, in which strangers or those of the half blood performed their exercises; which was the case of Hercules, to whom the place was consecrated. It had also a court of judicature to try illegitimacy, and to examine whether persons were Athenians of the whole or of the half blood. Here Antisthenes set up a new sect of philosophers called Cynics, either from the place, or from the snarling and impudent disposition of that sect.
