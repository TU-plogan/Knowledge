CURCAS, a name given in Egypt to an esculent root, approaching in taste and virtues to the colocasia. This is also a name given in Malabar to a small fruit of the shape and size of a hazel nut. It is very probable that the curcas of the East Indies may be the fruit called bell by Avicenna, and said to possess the same virtues. Gracias has been led into an error by this similarity of names and virtues, and supposes the curcas of Egypt the same with that of the East Indies.
