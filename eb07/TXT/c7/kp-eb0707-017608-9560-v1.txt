COMMISSARY, in the ecclesiastical law, an officer of the bishop, who exercises spiritual jurisdiction in places of a diocese so far from the episcopal see that the chancellor cannot call the people to the bishopâ€™s principal consistory court, w ithout putting them to too much inconvenience.

Commissary Court, in Scotland, a court originally constituted by the bishops, and anciently called the bishops court, curia Christianitatis, or consistorial court. This court was regulated by Queen Mary at the Reformation, and continued in a certain modified form as a separate tribunal until lately, when it was in a great measure merged in the court of session. See Scotland.
