CONTRITION, in Theology, a sorrow for our sins, resulting from the reflection of having offended God, and arising from the sole consideration of his goodness, without any regard to the punishment due to the trespass, and attended with a sincere resolution of forsaking them. The word is derived from the Latin conterere, to break or bruise.
