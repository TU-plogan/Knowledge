COWEL, Dr John, a learned civilian, was born about the year 1554. In 1607 he compiled a Law Dictionary, which gave great offence to Sir Edward Coke and the common lawyers, who first accused him to James I. of asserting that the king’s prerogative was in some cases limited; and when they failed in this attempt, complained of him to the House of Commons, as a betrayer of the rights of the people, by asserting that the king was not bound by the laws; for which he was committed to custody, and his book publicly burnt. He also published Institutiones Juris' Aηglicaηi, in the manner of Justinian’s Institutes; and died in the operation for the stone, in 1611.
