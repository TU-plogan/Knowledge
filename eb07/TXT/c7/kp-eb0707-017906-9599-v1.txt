COMMUNIBUS Locis, a Latin term, in frequent use among philosophical and other writers, implying some medium or mean relation between several places. Dr Keil supposes the ocean to be one quarter of a mile deep, communibus locis, that is, at a medium, or taking one place with another.

Communibus Annis has the same import with regard to years that communibus locis has with regard to places.
