CULMIFEROUS Plants (from culmus, a straw or haulm), plants, so called, which have a smooth jointed stalk, usually hollow, and wrapped about at each joint with single, narrow, sharp-pointed leaves, and the seeds contained in chaffy husks. Such are oats, wheat, barley, rye, and the other plants of the natural family of the Grasses.
