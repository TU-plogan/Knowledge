COVERT, in Law. Femme Covert or Couverte, denotes a woman married, and so under the coverture or protection of her husband.

Covert Way, in Fortification, is a space of five or six fathoms on the border of the ditch towards the country, and covered by a rising ground which has a gentle slope towards the field. The slope is called the glacis of the covert way.
