CORDON, in fortification, a row of stones, rounded on the outside, and set between the wall of the fortress which lies aslope, and the parapet which stands perpendicular, in such a manner, that the difference may not be offensive to the eye. Hence the cordons serve only as an ornament, ranging round about the place, and being only used in fortifications of stone-work; for in those constructed of earth the void space is filled up with pointed stakes.
