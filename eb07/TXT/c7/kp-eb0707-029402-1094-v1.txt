CONVERGING, or Convergent Lines, in Geometry, are such as continually approach nearer to one another, or whose distances become still less and less. These are opposed to divergent lines, the distances of which become continually greater. The lines which converge one way diverge the other.

Converging Rays, in Optics, those rays which, issuing from different points of an object, incline towards one another, till at last they meet, cross, and then become diverging rays.

Converging Series, a series of terms or quantities which always decrease the farther they proceed, or which tend to a certain magnitude or limit, in opposition to diverging series, or those which become continually larger and larger.
