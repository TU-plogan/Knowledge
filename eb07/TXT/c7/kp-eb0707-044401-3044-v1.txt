CRAMOND, a small village of Scotland, situated on the south side of the Frith of Forth, and distant about five miles from Edinburgh, at the conflux of the Forth and Almond. This place is only worthy of notice from having been a Roman station. The harbour, formed by the Almond at this place, was, during the dominion of that people, frequented by their vessels visiting the Forth; and on the opposite bank of the creek of the Almond, on a craggy eminence, they had a fortification. There are iron-works here, which constitute the chief support of the plaee.
