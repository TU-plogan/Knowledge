COLLEGIATE, or Collegial, churches, are those which have no bishopâ€™s see, yet have the ancient retinue of the bishop, the canons and prebends. Such are Westminster, Rippon, Windsor, &c. governed by deans and chapters. Collegiate churches, in Scotland, are those where two ministers serve the cure as colleagues; dividing the duty between them in such proportions as may be arranged or convenient, and generally preaching alternately.
