CONFARREATION, a ceremony among the ancient Romans, used in the marriage of persons whose children were destined for the honour of the priesthood.

Confarreation was the most sacred of the three modes of contracting marriage among that people, and consisted, according to Servius, in the pontifex maximus and flamen dialis joining and contracting the man and woman, by making them eat of the same cake of salted bread. The term is formed of con, signifying together, and far, signifying meal or flour.

Ulpian says it consisted in the offering up of some pure wheaten bread, rehearsing withal a certain formula in presence of ten witnesses. Dionysius Halicarnasseus adds, that the husband and wife ate of the same whcaten bread, and threw part on the victims.
