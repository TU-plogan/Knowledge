CORBAN, in Jewish antiquity, were those offerings which had life, in opposition to the minchab, or those which had not. It is derived from the word harab, which signifies to approach, because the victims were brought to the door of the tabernacle.

Corban is also a ceremony which the Mahommedans , perform at the foot of a mountain in Arabia, near Mecca. It consists in killing a great number of sheep, and in distributing the carcasses among the poor.
