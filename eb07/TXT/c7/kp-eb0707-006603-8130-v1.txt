COLE, William, a well-known botanist, was born at Adderbury, in Oxfordshire, about the year 1626, and studied at Merton College, in Oxford. He at length removed to Putney, near London, and published The Art of Simpling, and Adam in Eden, or Nature's Paradise. Upon the restoration of King Charles II. he was made secretary to Dr Duppa, bishop of Winchester; but died two years after, at the age of thirty-seven.
