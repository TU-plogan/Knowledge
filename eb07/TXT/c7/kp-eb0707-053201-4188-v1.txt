CULDEE, in Ecclesiastical History, a sort of monkish priests formerly inhabiting Scotland and Ireland. Being remâ€™arkable for the religious exercises of preaching and praying, they were called, by way of eminence, dei cultores ; and hence scems to be derived the word culdees. They made choice of one of their own fraternity to be their spiritual head, who was afterwards called the Scotch Bishop.
