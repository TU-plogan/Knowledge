CLYTEMNESTRA, in fabulous history, the daughter of Jupiter and Leda. She married Agamemnon; but whilst that prince was at the siege of Troy, she had an amorous intrigue with Aegisthus, whom she engaged to murder Agamemnon on his return to his dominions. Her son Orestes, however, revenged the death of his father by killing Aegisthus, and his mother Clytemnestra; but he was afterwards haunted by the Furies as long as he lived.
