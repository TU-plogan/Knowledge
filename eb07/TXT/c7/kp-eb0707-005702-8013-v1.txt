COLCHIS, a country of Asia, east of the Euxine Sea, north of Armenia, and west of Iberia. It is famous as the destination of the expedition of the Argonauts, and as the birthplace of Medea. It was fruitful in poisonous herbs, and produced excellent flax. The inhabitants were originally Egyptians, who settled there when Sesostris, king of Egypt, returned from his Indian expedition.
