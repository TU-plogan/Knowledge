CYATHUS, ×∙M0ος (from the verb χυw, fuηdο, to pour out), was a common measure among the Greeks and Romans, both of the liquid and dry kind. It was equal to an ounce, or the twelfth part of a pint. The cyathus was made with a handle like our punch ladle. The Roman topers used to drink as many cyathi as there were muses, namely, nine; and also as many as there were letters in their patron’s name. Thus they had modes of drinking similar to the modern health-drinking or toasting. The cyathus of the Greeks weighed ten drachms; but Galen says that a cyathus contained twelve drachms of oil, thirteen drachms and one scruple of wine, water, or vinegar, and eighteen drachms of honey; and he adds, that among the Veterinarii the cyathus contained two ounces.
