CORINNA, a Grecian lady, celebrated for her beauty and poetic talents, was born at Tanagra, in Boeotia, near Thebes, and was the disciple of Myrtis, another Grecian lady. Her verses were so much esteemed by the Greeks, that they gave her the name of the lyric muse. She lived in the time of Pindar, about 495 years before Christ, and is said to have five times gained the prize of lyric poetry in competition with that poet; but Pausanias observes that her beauty rendered the judges partial. She composed fifty .books of epigrams and odes, of which only some few verses remain, collected by Fulvius Ursinus and Christian Wolf.
