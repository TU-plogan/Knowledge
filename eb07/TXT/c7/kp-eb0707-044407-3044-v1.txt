CRANK, a mechanieal eontrivanee, in manner of an elbow, only of a square form, projecting out from an axis or spindle; and serving, by its rotation, to raise and let fall the pistons of engines for raising water.

Crank, in sea language. A ship is said to be cranksided, when, for want of a sufficient quantity of ballast or cargo, she cannot near her sails, or can bear but small sail for fear of oversetting. She is said to be crank by the ground, when her floor is so narrow that she cannot be brought on ground without danger.

Crank is also an iron braee which supports the lanthorns on the poop-quarters, &c.
