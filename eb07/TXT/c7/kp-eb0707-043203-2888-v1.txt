COUNTY, in Geography, originally signified the territory of a count or earl, but now it is used in the same sense with shire; the one word coming from the French, the other from the Saxon. In this view, a county is a circuit or portion of the realm; and the whole of England and Wales is divided, for its better government and the more easy administration of justice, into fifty-two counties.

For the execution of the laws in the'several counties, excepting Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Durham, every Michaelmas term officers are appointed under the denomination of sheriffs. The other officers of the several counties are, lord-lieutenant, who has the command of the militia of the county, custodes rotulorum, justices of peace, bailiffs, high constable, and coroner.

Of the fifty-tw√≤ counties, there are three of special note, which are therefore termed counties palatine, as Lancaster, Chester, and Durham.
