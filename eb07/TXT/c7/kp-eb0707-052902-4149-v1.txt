CUFA, a town of Irak Arabi, founded by the caliph Omar after the ruin of Ctcsiphon. It was the residence of the caliphs until Almanzor removed the seat of government to Bagdad. It afterwards fell intoÂ· decay, and at present there remains little more of it than the mosque in which Ali was assassinated. This is a plain building of a square form, and is still held in high veneration by the Mahommedans. It is ninety miles south of Bagdad.
