CONSTANTIA, a district at the Cape of Good Hope, consisting of two farms, which produce the wine known by the name of Cape or Constantia wine. This place is situated at the distance of a mile and a half from Alphen, in a bending or incurvation, formed by and nearly under the ridge of hills which runs from Meuisen-mountain, and just where it strikes off towards ‚àèoutbay. One of these farms is called Little Constantia. Here the white Constantia wine is made. The other produces the red.
