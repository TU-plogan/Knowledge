CONCLAMATIO, in Antiquity, a shout raised by those present at burning the dead, before they set fire to the funeral pile. The word was also applied to the signal given to the Roman soldiers to decamp; and hence the expression conclamare vasa, conclamare arma, was a signal for battle. It w as likewise used for the practice of calling to a person deceased three times by his name; and when no reply was returned, they expressed his decease by saying, conclamatum est. The same term was afterwards applied, on a similar analogy, to the cessation of the Roman empire.
