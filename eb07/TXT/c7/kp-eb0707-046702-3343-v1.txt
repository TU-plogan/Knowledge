CREUSA, in fabulous history, the daughter of Creon, king of Corinth. As she was going to marry Jason, who had divorced Medea, she put on a poisoned garment, which immediately set her body on fire, and she expired in the most excruciating torments. She had received this gown as a gift from Medea, who took that method of revenging the infidelity of Jason.
