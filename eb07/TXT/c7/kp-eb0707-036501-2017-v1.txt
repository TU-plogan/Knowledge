CORNAGE, an ancient tenure, the service of which was to blow a horn when any invasion of the Scots was perceived. This tenure was very frequent in the northern counties, near the Pictish wall; but by the statute 12 Car. II. all tenures are converted into free and common soccage. An old rental calls cornage newt-geldt, or neat-geldt. Lord Coke says, in old books it is called horngeld.
