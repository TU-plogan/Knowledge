COTYTTO, the goddess of debauchery. Her festivals, called cotyttia, were celebrated by the Athenians, Corinthians, Thracians, and other races of people, during the night. Her priests were called baptae, and nothing but debauchery and wantonness prevailed at the celebration of these festivals. A festival of the same name was observed in Sicily, where the votaries of the goddess carried about boughs hung with cakes and fruit, which it was lawful for any person to pluck off. It was a capital crime to reveal whatever was seen or done at these sacred festivals, and Eupolis lost his life for an unseasonable reflection upon them. The goddess Cotytto is supposed to be the same as Proserpine.
