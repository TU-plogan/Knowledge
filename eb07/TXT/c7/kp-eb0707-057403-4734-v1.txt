CYDNUS, in Ancient Geography, a river of Cilicia, rising in Mount Taurus, to the north of Tarsus, through the middle of which it ran, in a very clear and cold stream, which had almost proved fatal to Alexander when bathing in it; and falling into the sea at a place called Rhegma, a breach where the sea had broken in, afforded the people of Tarsus a station or port for their ships. The water of the Cydnus is commended by Strabo as of service in nervous disorders and the gout.
