COLONEL, in military matters, the commander in chief of a regiment, whether of horse, foot, or dragoons. Skinner derives the word from colony, being of opinion that the chiefs of colonies, called coloniales, might give name to chiefs or commanders of forces.

Colon el- Lieutenant, an officer who commands a regiment of guards, of which the king, prince, or other person of the first eminence, is colonel. Colonel-lieutenants had always a colonelâ€™s commission, and are usually general officers.

Lieutenant- Colon el, the second officer in a regiment, who is at the head of the captains, and commands in the absence of the colonel.
