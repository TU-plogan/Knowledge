CROISERS, a religious order founded in honour of the invention or discovery of the cross by the Empress Helena. They were dispersed in several parts of Europe, particularly in the Low Countries, France, Bohemia, and Italy, where, however, they were soon suppressed. These religious persons followed the rule of St Augustin. They had in England the name of Crouched Friars.
