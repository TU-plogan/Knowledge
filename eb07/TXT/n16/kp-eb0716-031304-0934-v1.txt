NYSA, or Nyssa, in Ancient Geography, a town of Ethiopia, to the south of Egypt. Some place it in Arabia. I his city, with another of the same name in India, was sacred to the god Bacchus, who was supposed to have been educated there by the nymphs of the place, and who received the name of Dionysus, which seems to be compounded of Δ/ο; and N∪tfα, the name of his father, and that of the place of his education. The god is believed to have made this place the seat of his empire, and the capital of the conquered nations of the East. According to some geographers, there were no less than ten places of this name.
