NENAGH, a market-town of Ireland, in the county of Tipperary and province of Munster, ninety-five miles south-west from Dublin. It is situated upon the Nenagh River, a little to the southward of its union with the Shannon, before it reaches Lough Derg. The town enjoys a good general country trade, but has no manufactures properly so called. Here are the ruins of an ancient castle, called Nenagh Round; also those of an hospital founded in the year 1200, for canons following the rule of St Augustin. There are four fairs held here in the course of the year. The population of the town amounts to 6335.
