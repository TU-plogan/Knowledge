NEAP or Neep Tides are those tides which happen when the moon is in the middle of the second and fourth quarters. The neap tides are low tides in respect of their opposites the spring tides. As the highest of the spring tides is three days after the full or change, so the lowest of the neap tides is four days before the full or change; on which occasion the seamen say that it is deep neap.
