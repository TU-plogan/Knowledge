NUNDYDROOG, a celebrated and strong hill fortress of Hindustan, in the province of Mysore. The mountain on which it is built is 1700 feet high, and it is inaccessible on three sides. This fortress, always considered as impregnable, was stormed by the British in 1791, after a siege of three weeks. The neighbouring country is fertile, being studded with hills, in which there is much fertile land. It was long ruled by one of those independent chiefs called poligars in Southern India. He was compelled to pay tribute to Hyder Aly, who ravaged his territories and laid waste the country. Long. 77. 53. E. Lat. 13. 22. N.
