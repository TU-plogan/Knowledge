NICOSIA, a city of the island of Sicily, in the kingdom of Naples, and in the province of Demone, eighty miles from Palermo. It stands on the ridge of a rocky mountain, the Herbita of antiquity. It is an ill-built city, and suffers from a scarcity of water; but as the situation is more healthy than that of many of the Sicilian cities, it contains a population of 12,060 inhabitants,occupying3167 houses, many of which are formed by excavations in the rocks. Near to it are two springs of fossil oil, a copious rock-salt mine, and several sulphureous baths.
