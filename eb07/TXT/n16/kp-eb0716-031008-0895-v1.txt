NUNEATON, a town of the county of Warwick, in the hundred of Hemlingford, ninety-nine miles from London, and eight from Coventry. It stands on the river Anker, and had formerly a nunnery, to which it owes its name. It partakes of the trade of Coventry, like that place making many ribbons, and, besides, some woollen goods. There is a market on Saturday. The population amounted in 1801 to 4796, in 1811 to 4947, in 1821 to 6610, and in 1831 to 7799.
