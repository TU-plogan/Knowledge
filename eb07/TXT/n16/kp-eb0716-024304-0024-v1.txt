NORDLAND, a province in the most northern part of Norway, extending over 45,000 square miles, the whole of which, with a slight exception, is within the polar circle. It is divided into two bailiwicks, Nordland and Finmark, which together contained in 1801 a population of 78,425 persons; but, within the thirty-six years that have since elapsed, it is supposed to have somewhat increased. The climate forbids extensive agriculture, but some little barley is grown as high as the latitude of seventy degrees. The chief subsistence of the inhabitants depends on the fisheries and the chase; and the only articles of exportation are salted fish, furs, hides, and feathers, which are sent to Bergen in exchange for the few foreign commodities that are wanted.
