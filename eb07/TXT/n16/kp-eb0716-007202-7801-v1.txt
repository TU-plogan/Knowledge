NECROLOGY (necrologium, formed of vεxeος, dead, and λoyβj, discourse), a book anciently kept in churches and monasteries, in which were registered the benefactors of the same, the time of their deaths, and the days of their commemoration; as also the deaths of the priors, abbots, religious, canons, and other persons. This was likewise called calendar and obituary.
