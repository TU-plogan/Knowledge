NITOCRIS, the mother of Belshazzar, whose father was Evilmerodach, and his grandfather Nebuchadnezzar. She was a woman of extraordinary abilities, who took upon herself the burden of all public affairs, and, whilst her son followed his pleasures, did all that could be done by human prudence to sustain the tottering empire. She perfected the works which Nebuchadnezzar had begun for the defence of Babylon; raised strong fortifications on the side of the river; and caused a wonderful tunnel to be constructed under it, leading from the old to the new palace. She likewise built a bridge across the Euphrates, and accomplished several other works, which were afterwards ascribed to Nebuchadnezzar. Philostrates, in describing this bridge, tells us that it was built by a queen, who was a native of Media; and hence we may conclude that this illustrious princess was by birth a Mede.
