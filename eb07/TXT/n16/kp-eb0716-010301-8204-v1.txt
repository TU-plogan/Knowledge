NERTSCHINK, a town of Asia, under the jurisdiction of Russia. It is situated on th*e Chinese frontier; but its importance has much declined since the route of the Chinese caravans, which was formerly through this town, has been changed to the route of Selinginsk. A few merchants still remain, who carry on a small fur trade, particularly in sables. It was built in 1658, and was then merely a palisadoed fort; but in 1781 it was raised to the rank of a town. It contains two churches, and about 2000 inhabitants, including the military. The neighbouring mountains afford excellent pasturage, but the district is chiefly distinguished by the mines of lead and silver, which are worked by the crown; and persons condemned to exile are employed in this remote part of the empire.
