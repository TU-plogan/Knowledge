NEOPHYTES, or new plants, a name given by the ancient Christians to those heathens who had newly embraced the faith, such persons being considered as regenerated, or born anew by baptism. The term neophytes has also been used for new priests, or those just admitted into orders; and sometimes for the novices in monasteries or convents. It is still applied to the converts made by the missionaries amongst the infidels.
