NINUS, the first king of the Assyrians, is said to have been the son of Belus. It is added, that he enlarged Nineveh and Babylon; conquered Zoroaster, king of the Bactrians; married Semiramis of Ascalon; subdued almost all Asia; and died after a glorious reign of fifty-two years,, about 1150 before Christ-But all these alleged facts are apocryphal.
