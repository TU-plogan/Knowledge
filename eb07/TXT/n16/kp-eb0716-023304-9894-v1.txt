NISROCH, a god of the Assyrians. Sennacherib was killed by two of his sons whilst he was paying his adorations to the god Nisroch in his temple (2 Kings, xix. 37); but it is not known who this god Nisroch was. The Septuagint calls him Mesrach, and Josephus denominates him Araskes, while the Hebrew of Tobit, published by Munster, calls him Dagon. The Jews have a strange notion concerning this deity, whom they fancy to have been a plank of Noah’s ark. Some think that the word signifies ι a dove; and others understand by it an eagle, which has given occasion to an opinion, that Belus, from whom the Assyrian kings pretended to be derived, was worshipped by them under the form of an eagle, and called Nisroch.
