NORMANS, a fierce and warlike people of Norway, Denmark, and other parts of Scandinavia. They at different times overran and ravaged most countries in Europe, in the respective histories of which a full account of them will be found.

Norman Characters, a species of writing introduced into England by William I. From some old manuscripts, the Norman writing appears to have been composed of letters nearly Lombardie. In regal grants, charters, public instruments, and law proceedings, this character was used with very little variation from the reâ…›n of the Conqueror till that of Edward III.
