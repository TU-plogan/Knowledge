NOB, a sacerdotal city of the tribe of Benjamin or Ephraim. St Jerome says, that in his time it was entirely destroyed, and that the ruins of it might be seen not far [7:16:235] from Diospolis. When David was driven away by Saul, he went to Nob, and asking the high priest Ahimelech for some provisions and arms, the priest gave him the shew-bread which had lately been taken oft' the holy table, and the sword of Goliath. Saul being informed of this by Doeg, caused all the priests of Nob to be slain, and the city to be destroyed. (1 Sam. xxi. xxii.)
