NEW ABBEY, situated near Kilcullen Bridge, in the county of Kildare, and province of Leinster, in Ireland. It was founded by Rowland Eustace, a man of ancient family in that county. The tower is still standing, and also some part of the abbey; the ruins of which have contributed to build several dwellings near it.
