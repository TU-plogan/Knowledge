NUBIAN Desert, a vast tract of barren rocks and burning sands, extending from Syene in Upper Egypt, to Geon, the capital of Berber in Nubia. As Syene is in latitude 24. 0. 45. north, and Geon in latitude 17. 57.22., the length of this desert from north to south is 6. 3. 23., or upwards of 420 English miles. Its breadth from east to west has not, as far as we know, been precisely ascertained.
