NUZZER, or Muzzeranah, a present or offering from an inferior to a superior. In Hindustan no man ever approaches his superior for the first time on business without an offering of at least a gold or silver rupee in his right hand; and if this be not taken, it is a mark of disfavour. Nuzzeranah is also used to signify the sum paid to the government as an acknowledgment for a grant of lands or any public office.
