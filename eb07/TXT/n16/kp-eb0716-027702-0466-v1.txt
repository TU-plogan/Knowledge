NOSOLOGY is a Greek word signifying a discourse or treatise of diseases, otherwise called pathology. The importance of a comprehensive and accurate nosology has been long and generally allowed. Baglivi, Boerhaave, Gorter, Gaubius, and Sydenham, have expressed their desire for a work of this kind, the great object of which should be to fix the pathognomonics of every disease, or to dispose all diseases into certain classes, orders, and genera, founded on distinctions taken from the symptoms only, without regard to remote or proximate causes.
