ALAND, a barony comprehending the island of that name, and the several other islands around it, at the point where the Baltic Sea divides into the Gulf of Bothnia and of Finland. The group consists of more than 80 inhabited and 200 uninhabited islands. Although the principal island is nearer to Sweden than to Finland, the whole were included with the cession of the latter country to Russia. The inhabitants are 13,340, without a city, and scarcely any place deserving the description of a town.

Aland, the chief island of a group on the border of Sweden, separated from it by the Straits of Alandshaf. It is in part covered with wood, but has some arable and more pasture land. On tlÎ¹e hills goats are reared; in the valleys sheep and cows. The shores are visited by shoals of fish, the catching and preserving of which forms the chief employment of the inhabitants. The island is about 40 miles long and 35 broad.
