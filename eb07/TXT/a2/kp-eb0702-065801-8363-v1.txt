AMMIRATO, Scipio, an eminent Italian historian, born at Lecca in Naples in 1531. After travelling over great part of Italy without settling to his satisfaction, he was engaged by the great duke of Tuscany to write the History of Florence, for which he was presented to a canonry in the cathedral there. He wrote other works while in this station, and died in 1600.
