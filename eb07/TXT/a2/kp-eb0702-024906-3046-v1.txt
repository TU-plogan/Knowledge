AGONISTICI, in Church History, a name given by Donatus to such of his disciples as he sent to fairs, markets, and other public places, to propagate his doctrine; for which reason they were also called Circutores, Circelliones, Catropitce, Coropitae, and at Rome Monteuses. They were called Agonistici, from the Greek αywι>, combat, in regard they were sent as it were to fight and subdue the people to their opinions.
