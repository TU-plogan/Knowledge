ADENAU, a circle in the department Rhine Moselle, in the Prussian province of the Lower Rhine. It extends over 172 square miles, or 110,080 acres, and contains 19,210 inhabitants, all Catholics, except 16 Jews and eight Protestants, in one city, three market towns, and 267 villages. It is watered by the river Ahr. It is generally a hilly and woody country, where little corn except oats grows, and where the chief subsistence is potatoes. Cattle and sheep are bred with tolerable success; and potashes and charcoal are made from the forests. There is some little employment furnished by spinning and weaving both linens and woollens on a small scale. The chief place of the same name contains 1250 inhabitants.
