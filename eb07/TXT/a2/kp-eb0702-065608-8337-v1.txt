AMILCAR, the name of several Carthaginian captains. The most celebrated of them is Amilcar Barcas, the father of Hannibal, who during five years infested the coast of Italy; when the Romans sending out their whole naval strength, defeated him near Trapani, 242 [7:2:657] years before Christ; and this put an end to the first Punic war. Amilcar began the second, and landed in Spain, where he subdued the most warlike nations; but as he was preparing for an expedition against Italy, he was killed in battle, 218 years before the Christian era. He left three sons, whom he had educated, as he said, like three lions, to tear Rome in pieces; and made Hannibal, his eldest son, swear an eternal enmity against the Romans.
