AMMONITES, a people descended from Ammon, the son of Lot, and who dwelt on the east side of Judaea, beyond Jordan. The Ammonites destroyed those giants called Zamzummims (Deut. ii. 19-21), and seized upon their country. God forbade Moses (ibid. 19) to attack the Ammonites, because their lands were not to be bestowed on the children of Israel. Justin Martyr says that in his time there were still many Ammonites remaining, but Origen assures us that in his day they were known only under the general name of Arabians. In this manner was the prediction of Ezekiel (xxv. 10) accomplished.
