ACTUARIUS, a celebrated Greek physician of the thirteenth century, and the first Greek author who has treated of mild purgatives, such as cassia, manna, senna, &c. He is the first also who mentions distilled waters. His works were printed in one volume folio, by Henry Stephens, in 1567.

Actuarius, or Actarius, a notary, or officer, appointed to write the acts or proceedings of a court, or the like. In the eastern empire, the actuarii were properly officers, who kept the military accounts, received the corn from the susceptores, or storekeepers, and delivered it to the soldiers.
