AFFECTION, in a general sense, implies an attribute inseparable from its subject. Thus magnitude, figure, weight, &c. are affections of all bodies; and love, fear, hatred, <⅛c. are affections of the mind.

Affection is a term used by various writers on Moral Philosophy to denote all those active principles whose direct and ultimate object is the communication either of enjoyment or of suffering to any one of our fellow-creatures. (Stewart’s Philosophy of the Active Powers, vol. i. p. 75.)

Affection, among physicians, is the same as disease. Thus, hysteric affection is the same as hysteric disease.
