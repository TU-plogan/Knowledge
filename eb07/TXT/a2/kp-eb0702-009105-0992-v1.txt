ACELDAMA, in Scripture history, a place without the south wall of Jerusalem,, beyond the brook of Siloam, which was called the Potter’s Field, because clay of which pots were made was dug out of it. It was afterwards bought with the money with which the high-priests and ι rulers of the Jews purchased the blood of Jesus Christ; arid hence it was called Aceldama, the field of blood.
