ALLEGRO, in Music, an Italian word, denoting that the part is to be played in a sprightly, brisk, lively, and gay manner.

Piu ALLEGRO signifies that the part it is joined to should be sung or played quicker; as Poco piu Allegro intimates that the part to which it refers ought to be played or sung only a little more briskly than allegro alone requires.
