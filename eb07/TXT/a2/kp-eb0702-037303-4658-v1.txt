ALAMODALITY, in a general sense, is the accommodating of a personâ€™s behaviour, dress, and actions, to the prevailing taste of the country or times in which he lives.

Alamodality of writing is defined, the accommodation of mental productions, both as to the choice of subject and the manner of treating it, to the genius or taste of the times, in order to render them more acceptable to the reader.
