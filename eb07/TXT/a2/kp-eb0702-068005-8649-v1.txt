ANABOLEUS, in Antiquity, an appellation given to grooms of the stable, or equerries, who assisted their masters in mounting their horses. As the ancients had no stirrups, or instruments that are now in use for mounting a horse, they either jumped upon his back, or were aided in mounting by anabole√¨.
