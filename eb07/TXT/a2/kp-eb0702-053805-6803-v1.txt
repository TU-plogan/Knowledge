ALOPECIA, a term used among physicians to denote a total falling off of the hair from certain parts, occasioned either by the defect of nutritious juice, or by its vitious quality corroding the roots of it, and leaving the skin rough and colourless. The word is formed from αλωτηξ, vulpes, a fox, whose urine, it is said, will occasion baldness, or because it is a disease which is common to that creature.
