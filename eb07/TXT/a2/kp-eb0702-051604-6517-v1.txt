ALIENATION, in Law, denotes the act of making over a man’s property in lands, &c. to another person.

ALIEN αtion in Mortmain, is the making over of lands, &c. to a body politic, or to a religious house.

ALIMENTARII Pueri, &c. were certain children maintained and educated by the munificence of the emperors, in a sort of public places not unlike our hospitals. Trajan was the first who brought up any of these alimentary boys. He was imitated by Adrian. Antoninus Pius did the same for a number of maids, at the solicitation of Faustina; and hence, in some medals of that empress, we read pvellae favstinianae. —Alexander Severus did the like at the request of Mammaea; and the maids thus educated were called Mammoeanoe. ALIMENTARY Ruct or Canal, is a name given by Dr Tyson and some others to that part of the body through which the food passes from its reception into the mouth to its exit at the anus ; including the gula, stomach, and intestines. See Anatomy. Alimentary Law, lex alimentaria, was an old law among the Romans, whereby children were obliged to find sustenance for their parents.
