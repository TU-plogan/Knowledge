ALCANTARA, a town of Spain, in the province of Estremadura, on the left bank of the Tagus, over which is a magnificent bridge. It is in long. 6.10. W. lat. 39. 44. N. It has two parish churches, five monasteries, and 3000 inhabitants.

Knights of Alcantara, a. military order of Spain, which took its name from the above-mentioned city. They make a very considerable figure in the history of the expeditions against the Moors. The knights of Alcantara make the same vows as those of Calatrava, and are only distinguished from them by this, that the cross fleur de lis, which they bear over a large white cloak, is of a green colour. They possess 37 commanderies. By the terms of the surrender of Alcantara to this order, it was stipulated that there should be a confraternity between the two orders, with the same practices and observances in both; and that the order of Alcantara should be subject to be visited by the grand master of Calatrava. But the former soon released themselves from this engagement, on pretence that their grand master had not been called to the election of that of Calatrava, as had been likewise stipulated in the articles. After the expulsion of the Moors, and the taking of Granada, the sovereignty of the order of Alcantara and that of Calatrava was settled in the crown of Castile by Ferdinand and Isabella. In 1540 the knights of Alcantara sued for leave to marry, which was granted them.
