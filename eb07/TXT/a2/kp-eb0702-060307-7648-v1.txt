AMBULANT, or Ambulatory. They gave in France the name of Ambulant Commissioners to those commissioners or clerks of the king’s farms who had no settled office, but visited all the offices within a certain district, to see that nothing was done in them against the king’s right and the interest of the farm.

Ambulant is also used to denote those brokers at Amsterdam, or exchange agents, who have not been sworn before the magistrates. They transact brokerage business, but their testimony is not received in the courts of justice.
