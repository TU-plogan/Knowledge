ADLEGATION, a term formerly used in the publie law of the German empire, to denote the right claimed by the states of the empire of adjoining plenipotentiaries, in public treaties and negotiations, to those of the emperor, for the transacting of matters whieh relate to the empire in general; in whieh sense adlegation differs from legation, which is the right of sending ambassadors on a personâ€™s own account.
