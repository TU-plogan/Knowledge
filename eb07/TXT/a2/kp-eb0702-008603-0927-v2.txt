ACCESSION, in Law, is a method of acquiring property, by which, in things that have a close connection or dependence upon one another, the property of the principal thing draws after it the property of the accessory: thus, the owner of a cow becomes likewise the owner of the calf. It sometimes likewise signifies consent or acquiescence.
