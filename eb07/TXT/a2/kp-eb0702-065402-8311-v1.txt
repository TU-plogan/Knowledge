AMERSFORT, a city in the Dutch province of Utrecht, seated on the river Ems. The most remarkable objects are, the town-house; the grand palace, which is triangular; the public walk, planted with trees; and the great church, dedicated to St George. The land to the east and south of this city is very fruitful; on the north there is nothing but pasturage ground, and on the west it is woody. Long. 5. 4. E. Lat. 52. 14. N.
