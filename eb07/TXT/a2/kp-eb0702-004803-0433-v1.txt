ABUSAID, Ebn Aljaptu, sultan of the Moguls, succeeded his father anno 717 of the Hegira. He was the last monarch of the race of Jenghis Khan, who held the undivided empire of the Moguls; for after his death, which happened the same year that Tamerlane was born, it became a scene of blood and desolation, and was broken into' separate sovereignties.
