ALBERONI, Julius, the son of a poor gardener in the suburbs of Placentia, born in 1664, who, by his great abilities and good fortune, rose from this low ^origin to the employment of first minister of state at the court of Spain, and to the dignity of cardinal. He roused that kingdom out of the lethargy it had sunk into for a century past, awakened the attention and raised the astonishment of all Europe by his projects, one of which was to set the Pretender on the throne of Great Britain. He was at length deprived of his employment, and banished to Rome. He died in 1752, at the great age of 87. His Testament Politique, collected from his memoirs and letters, was published at Lausanne in 1753.
