ACHMIM, Akmim, or Echmim, a considerable city of â€™ Upper Egypt, situated in a district very fertile in grain, cotton, and sugar. The streets are broader and more regular than is usual in Egypt, though, being built only of unburnt brick, they have a dull gloomy appearance. The . Greeks have a church, which they hold in great veneration, and which is adorned with granite pillars from the ruins of Chemnis or Panopolis, a celebrated city, of which few other vestiges now remain.
