ADOREA, in Roman Antiquity, a word used in different senses: sometimes for all manner of grain; sometimes for a kind of cakes made of fine flour, and offered in sacrifice; and, finally, for a dole or distribution of corn, as a reward for some service; whence by metonymy it is put for praise or rewards in general.
