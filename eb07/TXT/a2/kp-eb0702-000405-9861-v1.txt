AASI, a river called by the ancients sometimes the Orontes, at others the AxÎ¹us. It issues an insignificant stream from Schebel at Schalk, and vastly increases its water by the Jermut, the Keber, the Esurd, and other rivers that rise on the eastern side of Mount Lebanon. It then passes through the lakes Kades and Epamea, thence takes a south-west course, and, augmented by the water of the lake Antakia, enters the Mediterranean Sea to the southward of Scanderoon.
