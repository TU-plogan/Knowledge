AGENDA, among philosophers and divines, signifies the duties which a man lies under an obligation to perform. Thus, we meet with the agenda of a Christian, or the duties he ought to perform; in opposition to the credenda, or things he is to believe.

Agenda, among merchants, a term sometimes used for a memorandum-book, in which is set down all the business to be transacted during the day, either at home or abroad.

Agenda, among ecclesiastical writers, denotes the service or office of the church. We meet with agenda matutina et vespertina, the morning and evening prayers; agenda diet, the office of the day, whether feast or fast-, agenda mortuorum, called also simply agenda, the service of the dead.

Agenda is also applied to certain church-books, compiled by public authority, prescribing the order and manner to be observed by the ministers and people in the principal ceremonies and devotions of the church; in which sense agenda amounts to the same with what is otherwise called ritual, liturgy, acalouthia, missal, formulary, directori/, &c.
