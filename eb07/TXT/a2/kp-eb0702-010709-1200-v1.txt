ACORN, the fruit of the oak-tree.

Acorn, in sea language, a little ornamental piece of wood, fashioned like a cone, and fixed on the uppermost point of the spindle, above the vane, on the mast head. It is used to keep the vane from being blown off from the spindle in a whirlwind, or when the ship leans much to one side under sail.
