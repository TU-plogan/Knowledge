AMEDIANS, in Ecclesiastical History, an order of monks in Italy, so called from their professing themselves amantes Deum, lovers of God; or rather amati Deo, beloved of God. They wore a grey habit and wooden shoes, had no breeches, and girt themselves with a cord. They had 28 convents, and were united by Pope Pius V. partly with the Cistercian order, and partly with that of the Soccolanti, or wooden-shoe wearers.
