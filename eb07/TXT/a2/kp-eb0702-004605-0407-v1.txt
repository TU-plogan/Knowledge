ABSYRTUS, in heathen mythology, the son of Aeetes â€¢and Hypsea, and the brother of Medea. The latter running away with Jason, after her having assisted him in carrying off the golden fleece, was pursued by her father; when, to stop his progress, she tore Absyrtus in pieces, and scattered his limbs in his way.
