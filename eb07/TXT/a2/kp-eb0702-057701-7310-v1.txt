ALUNTIUM, or Alontium, in Ancient Geography, a town in the north of Sicily, situated on a steep eminence at the mouth of the Chydas; said to be as old as the war of Troy. It is now in ruins; and from these has arisen the hamlet St Philadelfo, in the Val di Demona. The inhabitants were called Haluntim.
