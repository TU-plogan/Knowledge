ACESINES, in Ancient Geography, a large and rapid river of India, which Alexander passed in his expedition into that country. The kingdoιħ of Porus, which was conquered by Alexander, lay between the Hydaspes and this river, which, uniting with the former and other considerable rivers, pours its waters into the Indus. According to Major Rennell, the modern Chunab is the Acesines of the ancients.
