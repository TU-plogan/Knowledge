There is a roadstead, but no harbour. It contains 11,000 inhabitants. Near it are the vestiges of the ancient city of Gela.

Alicata, a mountain of Sicily, near the valleys Me-zara and Noto, upon which was situated, as is generally thought, the famous Daedalion, where the tyrant Phalaris kept his brazen bull.
