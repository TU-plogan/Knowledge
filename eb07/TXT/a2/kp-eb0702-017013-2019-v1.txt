AEGILOPS, the name of a tumour in the great angle of the eye, either with or without an inflammation. The word is compounded of α∕ξ, goat, and ω∙ψ, eye ; as goats are supposed extremely liable to this distemper. If the aegilopsbe accompanied with an inflammation, it is supposed to take its rise from the abundance of blood which a plethoric habit discharges on the corner of the eye. If it be without an inflammation, it is supposed to proceed from a viscous pituitous humour, thrown upon this part. The [7:2:171] method of cure is the same as that of the ophthalmia. But before it has reached the lachrymal passages, it is managed like other ulcers. If the aegilops be neglected, it bursts, and degenerates into a fistula, which eats into the bone.
