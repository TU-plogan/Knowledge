AMBUBAJAe, in Homan Antiquity, were immodest women, who came from Syria to Rome, where they lived by prostitution, and by playing on the flute. The word is derived from the Syriac abub, which signifies a flute; although others make it to come from am and Baioe, because these prostitutes often retired to Baiae.
