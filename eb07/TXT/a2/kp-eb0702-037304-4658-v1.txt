ALAMODE, a phrase originally French, importing a thing to be in the fashion or mode. The phrase has been adopted not only into several of the living languages, as the English and High Dutch, but some have even taken it into the Latin. Hence we meet with Alamodicus and Αlαιnοdαlitas. Alamode, in Commerce, a thin, glossy, black silk, chiefly used for women’s hoods and men’s mourning scarfs.
