ALCANNA, or Alkanna, in Commerce, a powder prepared from the leaves of the Egyptian privet, in which the people of Cairo drive a considerable trade. It is much used by the Turkish women, to give a golden colour to their nails and hair. In dyeing, it gives a yellow colour when steeped with common water, and a red one when infused in vinegar. There is also an oil extracted from the berries of alcanna, which is sometimes used in medicine.
