ABIANS, or Abii, anciently a people of Thrace, or (according to some authors) of Scythia. They had no fixed habitations, but led a wandering life; dwelling on waggons, which carried all their possessions. They lived on the flesh of their herds and flocks, on milk and cheese, chiefly on that of marcâ€™s milk. They were unacquainted with commerce, and only exchanged commodities with their neighbours. Besides these, many other qualities and habits are ascribed to them, which are justly regarded as fictitious.
