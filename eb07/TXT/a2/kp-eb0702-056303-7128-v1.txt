ALQUIFOU, or Arquifou, is a sor≈•of lead ore, which, when broken, looks like antimony. It is used by the potters to give a green varnish to their works, and thence is called potters ore. It is met with in Cornwall, &c. The potters mix a small portion of manganese with the alquifou, and then the varnish or glazing on their ware is of a blackish hue.
