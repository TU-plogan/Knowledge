AGRIPPINA, daughter of Germanicus, sister of Caligula, and mother of Nero; a woman of wit, but excessively lewd. She was thrice married, the last time to Claudius, her own uncle, whom she poisoned to make way for Nero, her son. Nero afterwards caused her to be murdered in her chamber, when she bid the executioner stab her first in the belly, that had brought forth such a monster.

Agrippina Colonia Ubiorum, in Ancient Geography, now Cologne; so called from Agrippina, the daughter of Germanicus and mother of Nero, who had a colony sent thither at her request by the emperor Claudius, to honour the place of her birth. See Cologne.
