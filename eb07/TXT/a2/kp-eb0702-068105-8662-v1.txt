ANACRISIS, among the ancient Greeks, was used for a kind of trial or examination, which the archons or chief magistrates of Athens were to undergo before their admission into that office. The aÎ·acrisis stands distinguished from the docirnasia, which was a second examination in the forum. The anacrisis was performed in the senatehouse. The questions here proposed to them were concerning their family, kindred, behaviour, estate, &c. Some will have it that all magistrates underwent the anacrisis.

Anacrisis, among civilians, an investigation of truth, interrogation of witnesses, and inquiry made into any fact, especially by torture.
