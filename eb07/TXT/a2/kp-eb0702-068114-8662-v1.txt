ANAGOGY, or Anagoge, among ecclesiastical writers, the elevation of the mind to things celestial and eternal. It is particularly used where words, in their natural or primary meanings, denote something sensible, but have a further view to something spiritual or invisible.

Anagogy, in a more particular sense, denotes the application of the types and allegories of the Old Testament to subjects of the New; thus called, because the veil being here drawn, what before was hidden is exposed to open sight.
