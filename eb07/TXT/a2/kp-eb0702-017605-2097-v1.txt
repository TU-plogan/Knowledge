AERIA, or Eeria, in Ancient Geography, the ancient name of Egypt. The scholiast on Apollonjus Rhodius says, that not only Thessaly, but Egypt, was ealled Hεgια by the Greeks, whieh Eusebius also confirms; and hence Apollinarius, in his translation of the 114th Psalm, uses it for Egypt. Hesyehius applies this name to Ethiopia.
