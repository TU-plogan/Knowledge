ALMARIC, the name of a tenet broached in France by one Almaric, in the year 1209. It consisted in affirming that every Christian was actually a member of Christ, and that without this faith no one could be saved. His followers went farther, and affirmed that the power of the Father lasted only during the continuance of the Mosaic law; that the coming of Christ introduced a new law; that at the end of this began the reign of the Holy Ghost; and that now confession and the sacraments were at an end, and that every one is to be saved by the internal operation of the Holy Spirit alone, without any external act of religion. Their morals were as infamous as their doctrine was absurd. Their tenets were condemned by a public decree of the council of Sens, in the year 1209.
