ADOWA, the capital of Tigr√© in Abyssinia, is situated on the declivity of a hill, on the west side of a small plain, which is surrounded on every side by mountains. The name, signifying pass or passage, is characteristic of its situation; for the only .road from the Red Sea to Gondar passes by Adowa. The town consists of 300 houses, is the residence of the governor, and has a manufactory of coarse cotton cloth, which circulates in Abyssinia as the medium of exchange in place of money. Long. 38. 50. E. Lat. 14. 7. N.
