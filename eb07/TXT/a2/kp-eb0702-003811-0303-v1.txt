ABLUTION, a ceremony in use among the ancients, and still practised in several parts of the world; it consisted in washing the body, which was always done before sacrificing, or even entering their houses. Ablutions appear to be as old as any ceremonies, and external worship itself. Mioses enjoined them, the heathens adopted them, and Mahomet and his followers have continued them; thus they have got footing among most nations, and make a considerable part of many established religions.
