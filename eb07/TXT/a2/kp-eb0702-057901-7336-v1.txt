ALVAH, the wood with which Moses sweetened the waters of Marah. (Exod. ch. xv. vcr. 25.) The name of this wood is not found in Scripture; but the Mahometans give it that of alvah, and pretend to trace its history from the patriarchs before the flood. Josephus, on the contrary, says that Moses used the wood which he found lying next him.
