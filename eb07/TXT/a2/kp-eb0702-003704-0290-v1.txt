ABIRAM, a seditious Levite, who, in concert with Ko-rah and Dathan, rebelled against Moses and Aaron, in order to share with them in the government of the people; when Moses ordering them to come with their censers before the altar of the Lord, the earth suddenly opened under their feet, and swallowed up them and their tents; and at the same instant fire came from heaven and consumed 250 of their followers. Numb. chap. xvi.
