ALLEGEAS, or Allegi As, a stuff manufactured in the East Indies. There are two sorts of them; some are of cotton, and others of several kinds of herbs, which are spun like flax and hemp. Their length and breadth are of eight ells, by five, six, or seven eighths; and of twelve ells, by three fourths or five eighths.
