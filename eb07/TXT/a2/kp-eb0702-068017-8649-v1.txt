ANACLINTERIA, in Antiquity, a kind of pillows on [7:2:681] the dining bed, whereon the guests used to lean. The ancient tricliniary beds had four pillows, one at the head, another at the feet, a third at the back, and a fourth at the breast. That on which the head lay was properly called by the Greeks avaxXivrŋgiov or avaxλ∕vrgov ; by the Romans fulcrum, sometimes pluteus.
