ALCIBIADES, an Athenian general. It was the fate of this great man to live at a time when his country was a scene of confusion. The Greeks, grown insolent from their conquests in Persia, turned their armies against each other, and bandied together under the conduct of the two most opulent states, Athens and Lacedemon. Alcibiades, in the midst of an expedition he had planned against the enemies of his country, was recalled home to answer some charge of a private nature; but fearing the violence of his enemy, instead of going to Athens, he offered his services at Sparta, where they were readily accepted. By his advice the Lacedemonians made a league with Persia, which gave a very favourable turn to their affairs. But his credit in the republic raising jealousies against him, he privately reconciled himself to his country, and took again the command of the Athenian army. Here victory, waiting as it were at his command, attended all his motions. The loss of seven battles obliged the Spartans to sue for peace. He enjoyed his triumphs, however, only a short time at Athens. One unsuccessful event made him again obnoxious to the malice of his citizens, and he found it expedient to retire from Athens. In his absence the Spartans again took the lead, and at the fatal battle of Aegos entirely subdued the Athenian power. Alcibiades, though an exile, endeavoured to restore the power of his country; of which the Spartans having intelligence, procured him to be assassinated. He was a man of admirable accomplishments, but indifferently principled; of great parts, and of an amazing versatility of genius.
