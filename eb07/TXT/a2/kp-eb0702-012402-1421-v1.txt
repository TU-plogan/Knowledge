ACQUAPENDENTE, a pretty large town of Italy, in the territory of the Church and patrimony of St Peter, with a bishopâ€™s see. It is seated on a mountain near the river Paglia, 10 miles west of Orvieto, and 57 north by [7:2:125] west of Rome. It takes its name from a fall of water near it, and is now almost desolate.
