AEOLUS, in Heathen Mythology, the god of the winds, was said to be the son of Jupiter by Acasta or Sigesia, the daughter of Hippotas; or, according to others, the son of Hippotas by Meneclea, daughter of Hyllus, king of Lipara. He dwelt in the island Strongyle, now called Strombolo, one of the seven islands called Aeolian, from their being under the dominion of Aeolus. Others say that his residence was at Rhegium, in Italy; and others, again, place him in the island Lipara. He is represented as having authority over the winds, which he held enchained in a vast cavern, to prevent their continuing the devastations they had been guilty of before they were put under his direction.
