ALJAMEIA is a name which the Moriscoes in Spain give to the language of the Spaniards. Among other articles agreed on by thejunta which was appointed by the emperor Charles V. in 1526, in favour of the Moriscoes, this was one, that the Moriscoes should no longer speak Algavareia, i. e. Moorish, or Arabic; but should all speak Aljameia, i. e. Spanish, as it was called by the Moors, and all their writings and contracts should be in that language.
