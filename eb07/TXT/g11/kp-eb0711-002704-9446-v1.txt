GUIDON, a sort of flag or standard borne by the kingâ€™s life-guard; being broad at one extremity, almost pointed at the other, and slit or divided into two parts. The guidon is the ensign or flag of a troop of horse-guards.

Guidon also denotes the officer who bears the guidon. The guidon is in the horse-guards what the ensign is in the foot. The guidon of a troop of horse takes place next below the cornet.

Guidons, Guidones, or Schola Guidonum, was a company of priests established by Charlemagne, at Rome, to conduct and guide pilgrims to Jerusalem. They were also to assist them in case they fell sick, and to perform the last offices to them if they died.
