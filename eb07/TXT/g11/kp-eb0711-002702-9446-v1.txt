GUIDI, Alexander, an eminent Italian poet, born at Pavia in 1650. Having a desire to see Rome, he repaired to that city, where he attracted the notice of Queen Christina of Sweden, who retained him at her court; he also obtained a considerable benefice from Pope Innocent XÃ¯. and a pension from the Duke of Parma. Having done the state of Milan some good offices with Prince Eugene, he was enrolled amongst the nobles and decurions of that town, and died in the year 1712. Nature had been kinder to his intellect than to his exterior form; for his body was small and crooked, his head large, and he wanted the sight of his right eye. A collection of his works was published at Verona in 1726.
