GUSTAVUS I. king of Sweden, was son of Eric de Vasa, duke of Gripsholm. Christian II. king of Denmark, having made himself master of the kingdom of Sweden, confined Gustavus at Copenhagen; but the latter making his escape, wandered for a long time in the forests, till the cruelties of the tyrant having occasioned a revolution, he was first declared governor of Sweden, and then in 1513 elected king. This prince introduced Lutheranism into his dominions, which in a little time spread itself all over the kingdom. He died in 1560; having made his kingdom hereditary, which was before elective. See Sweden. Gustavus Adolphus, surnamed the Great, king of Sweden, was born at Stockholm in 1594, and succeeded his father Charles in 1611. He espoused the cause of the Protestants in Germany, who were oppressed and almost entirely ruined by the Emperor Ferdinand. He was a great warrior, and gained many victories, but fell at last in the battle of Lutzen. See Sweden.
