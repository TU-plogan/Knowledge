GUM (Gummi) is a concrete vegetable juice, of no particular smell or taste, but which becomes viscous and tenacious when moistened with water; totally dissolves in water into a liquid, more or less glutinous in proportion to the quantity of the gum; is not affected by vinous spirits or oils; burns in the fire to a black coal, without melting or catching flame; and suffers no dissipation in the heat of boiling water. The true gums are gum-arabic, gum-tragacanth, gum-senegal, the gum of cherry and plum trees, and such like. All else have more or less of resin in them.

Gum, among gardeners, a kind of gangrene incident to fruit trees of the stone kind, arising from a corruption of the sap, which, from its viscidity, not being able to make its way through the fibres of the tree, is, by the protrusion of other juice, made to extravasate and ooze out upon the bark.
