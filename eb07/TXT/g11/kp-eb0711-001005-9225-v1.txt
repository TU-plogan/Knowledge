GRUS, in Antiquity, a dance performed yearly by the young Athenians around the temple of Apollo, on the day of the Delia. The motions and figures of this dance were intricate and various, some of them having been intended to express the windings of the labyrinth in which the Minotaur was killed by Theseus.

Grus, in Astronomy, a southern constellation, not visible in our latitude.
