GUNTOOR, one of the districts in Hindustan, on the western side of the Bay of Bengal, called the Northern Circars. It is situated principally between the sixteenth and seventeenth degrees of north latitude, and lies immediately north of the Carnatic, and south of the river Kistnah or Krishnah, which separates it from Condapilly. It is the most southerly of the Northern Circars, and comprehends an area of about 2500 square miles, exclusively of the mountainous district on the west. This district was the jaghire of Bassalut Jung, the brother of the nizam, when Lord Clive obtained, in 1765, the Northern Circars from the Mogul, on which account he was allowed to retain it during his life; but after this it was to devolve to the Company. He died in 1782, but the country was not taken possession of by their agents till 1788. It is a low, flat country, better calculated for growing rice than the more valuable grains. Its principal sea-port is Mootapilly, and its principal towns are Guntoor, Condavir, Bellum-condah, and Nizampatam. With the addition of Palnaud, the Guntoor territory now forms one of the districts under the Madras presidency, into which the Northern Circars were divided when the present Bengal judicial and revenue system was established. Guntoor is the capital. Long. 80. 20. E. Lat. 16. 12. N.
