GOACH, the capital town of the Macassar country, in the island of Celebes. It is sometimes called the kingdom of Goach. Here the Malays, after the arrival of the Portuguese in 1512, were allowed to build a mosque, as they were not yet converted to the Christian religion. In 1778 the city was stormed by the Dutch, and the fortifications razed.
