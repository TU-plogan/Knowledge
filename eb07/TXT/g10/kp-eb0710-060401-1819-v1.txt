GOGGRAH, a river of Hindustan, which forces its way through the great Himalaya chain, though its exact source has never been ascertained. It afterwards falls into the Sareyn at Swarojadwara, the united streams afterwards being named indifferently the Goggrah, Sarfew, or Deva river. This river flows through the district of Kemaon and province of Oude, and at Manjee joins the Ganges, of which it is one of the largest tributary streams. It is navigable for large boats to the foot of the hills, and is held sacred by the Hindus. There are several large towns on its banks.
