GOOMTY, a river of Hindustan, so named from its winding course, and which has its source in the mountains of Kemaon, whence it flows in a south-east direction through the province of Oude, and, after passing the cities of Lucknow, Sultanpore, and Joanpore, falls into the Ganges about fourteen miles below Benares. It is navigable for boats as high as Lucknow at all times of the year.
