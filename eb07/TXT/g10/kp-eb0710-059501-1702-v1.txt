GODALMING, a market-town of the hundred of its own name, iu the county of Surrey, on the great road to Portsmouth, thirty-four miles from London. It is very pleasantly situated in a valley, watered by the river Wye, which is navigable to the Thames, and by the latter to the metropolis, and consists of one principal street, and several smaller ones. There is a corporation, consisting of four aidermen and twelve councillors. There is a well-attended market on Saturdays, at which much corn, especially barley, is sold; and making it into malt is one branch of the trade carried on, and by the river much is transmitted to London. The population amounted in 1801 to 3405, in 1811 to 3543, in 1821 to 4098, and in 1831 to 4529.
