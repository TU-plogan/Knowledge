GIRALDI, Lilio Gregorio, an ingenious critic, and one of the most learned men modem Italy has producedÂ» was bom at Ferrara in the year 1479. He was at Rome when it was plundered by the Emperor Charles V.; and having thus lost all he had, and being at the same time tormented by the gout, he struggled through life with ill fortune and ill health. He nevertheless wrote a number of works, which were collected and published at Basil, 1580, in two vols, folio, and at Leyden in 1696. Authors of the first rank have bestowed the highest eulogies on Giraldus, particularly Cassaubon and Thuanus.
