GANGPOUR, a small district of Hindustan, in the province of Gundwana, situated about the twenty-second degree of north latitude, and bounded on the north by the British district of Chuta Nagpoor, in Bahar. It was annexed to the province of Allahabad during the reign of Aurungzebe, though it was only reduced under nominal subjection to that monarch. It is a barren, mountainous, and unproductive country, still inhabited by uncivilized tribes of Hindoos. The chief river is the Soank, and the principal towns are Gangpoor and Padah.
