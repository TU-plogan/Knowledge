GRAND, a term rather French than English, though used on many occasions in our language. It has the same import with great, being formed from the Latin grandis. In this sense we say, the grand-master of an order, as the grand-master of Malta and of the free-masons; the grand-signior and the grand-visier; grandfather, grandmother, and the like. Amongst the French there were formerly several officers thus denominated; as grand almoner,grand ecuyer, grand chambellan, grand voyer, and the like.

Grand Distress (districtio magna), in English Law, a writ of distress, so called on account of its extent, which reaches to all the goods and chattels of the party within the county.

Grand Gusto, amongst painters, a term used to intimate that there is something in the picture calculated to surprise, please, and instruct.
