GALAXY, in Astronomy, the long white luminous track which seems to encompass the heavens like a coronal or girdle, and which is easily perceivable in a clear night, especially when the moon does not appear. The Greeks coll it yαλαξ<αs, galaxy, on account of its colour and appearance. The Latins, for the same reason, call it via lactea, or milky way. It passes between Sagittarius and Gemini, and divides the sphere into two parts. It is unequally broad, and in some parts is single, in others double. See Astronomy.
