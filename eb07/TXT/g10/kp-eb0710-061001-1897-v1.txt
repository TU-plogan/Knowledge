GONONG APEE, one of the smaller Banda Islands, at the north-east end of the harbour of Beema, in the island of Sumbawa, and forming the west side of the north entrance of Sapy Straits. It derives its name from a large volcano about 1500 feet in height, and which terminates in two high peaks, and constantly emits smoke and ashes. It is separated from Neira by a narrow strait, and at a distance has the appearance of a heap of cinders. On the south side of the island are two forts, originally intended to defend the west channel of Lantore harbour; but owing to the eruption of the volcano in 1778, the lava flowed down in such quantities as to render them in a great degree useless.
