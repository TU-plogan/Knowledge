GITTITH, a Hebrew word occurring frequently in the Psalms, and generally translated wine-presses. The conjectures of interpreters are various concerning this word. Some think it signifies a sort of musical instrument; others, that the psalms with this title were sung after the vintage; and others, again, that the hymns of this kind were invented in the city of Gath. Calmet is rather of opinion that it was applied to the class of young women or songstresses of Gath by whom they were sung. Dr Hammond thinks that the psalms with this title were all set to the same tune, and made on Goliath the Gittite.
