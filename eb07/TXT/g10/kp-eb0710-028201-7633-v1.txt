GAHRAH, a small town of Hindustan, in the province of Sinde, situated on the banks of a salt-water creek communicating with the sea, and navigable for small boats. The surrounding country is barren and sandy; and the dry and parching wind blows up the sand in clouds, so as nearly to blind both man and beast. Long. 67. 56. E. Lat. 24. 46. N.
