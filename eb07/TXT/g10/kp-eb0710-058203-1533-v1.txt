GLAUCUS, a marine god, or deity of the sea. There are a great many fabulous accounts of this divinity; but his poetical history is, that, before his deification, he was a fisherman of the town of Anthedon, and having one day taken a considerable number of fishes, which he laid upon the bank, he on a sudden perceived that these fishes, having touched a kind of herb which grew on the shore, re ceived new strength, and leaped again into the sea; upon which he was tempted to taste of the herb himself, and presently leaped into the sea after them, where he was metamorphosed into a Triton, and became one of the sea-gods.
