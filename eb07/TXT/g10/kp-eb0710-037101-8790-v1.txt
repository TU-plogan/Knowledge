GAUGING. See Mensuration. GΛUβiNG-Rod, an instrument used in gauging or measuring the contents of any vessel. That usually employed is the four-foot gauging rod. It is commonly made of box, and consists of four rules, each a foot long, and about three eighths of an inch square, joined together by three brass joints; by which means the rod is rendered four feet long when the four rules are quite opened, and but one foot when they are all folded together.
