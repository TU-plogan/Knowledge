GAWELGUR, a strong fortress of Hindustan, in the province of Berar. Its situation is elevated on a high and rocky hill between the Poornah and Taplee rivers. It consists of a citadel with an inner fort, which fronts the north, where the rock is most inaccessible; and the citadel is defended by an outer fort, and both are very strongly fortified, and the ascent by the road is very long and steep, and well defended. Notwithstanding these strong defences, it was taken by the army under General Wellesley, on the 14th of December 1803, after a siege of only two days, and was restored to the rajah on the conclusion of the peace. Gawelgur is thirty-two miles northnorth-west from Ellichpoor. Long. 77.52. E. Lat. 21.46. N.
