GRAPNEL, or Grafling, a sort of small anchor, fitted with four or five flukes or claws, and commonly used to ride a boat or other small vessel.

Fire-GRΛPPLrNθ, an instrument nearly resembling the former, but differing in the construction of its flukes, which are furnished with strong barbs at their points. These machines are usually fixed on the yard-arms of a ship, in order to grapple an adversary whom it is intended to board.
