AYAMONTE, a town of Spain, in the province of Seville. It is a sea-port in the centre of the gulf of Huelva. The Guadiana, increased by the stream of the Chauza, passes the town, and empties itself into the ocean at this spot. Ayamonte is well fortified, and the harbour is good, but, on account of a bar at its mouth, it is of difficult entrance. Considerable employment is furnished to the sailors of [7:4:258] this place by the fisheries, especially for sardinÄ©as and for the tunny, both of which are highly prized. It contains 5500 inhabitants. Silk spinning is carried on here. Lat. 37. 9. N. This also is the name of a town in Portugal, in the province of Alentejo, three miles north-west of Minfort.
