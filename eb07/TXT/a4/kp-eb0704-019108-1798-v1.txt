AUGUST (augustus), in a general sense, something majestic, venerable, or sacred. The appellation was first conferred by the Roman senate upon Octavius, after he had been confirmed by them in the sovereign power.

August, in Chronology, the eighth month of our year, containing 31 days. August was dedicated to the honour of Augustus Caesar, because in the same month he was created consul, thrice triumphed in Rome, subdued Egypt to the Roman empire, and made an end of the civil wars. It was previously called Sextilis, or the sixth month from March.
