AUSSERHODEN, one of the districts of the canton of Appenzell, in Switzerland, comprehending two thirds of that territory, being 227 square miles, or 145,280 acres, and containing 42,000 inhabitants. It is subdivided into two parts, namely, the Hither and Farther Gitten. All the inhabitants of this latter district adhere to the Protestant reformed church, as those of the former do to the Romish faith, which renders the administration of the two parts distinct from each other.
