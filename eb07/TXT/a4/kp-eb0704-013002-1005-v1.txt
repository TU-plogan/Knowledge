ATHLONE, a market town in Ireland, lying partly in Westmeath, and partly in Connaught. It is situated on the river Shannon, by which it is intersected, the opposite sides being connected by an ancient stone bridge. This afforded the principal passage over the river; and hence, in the war of 1688, the possession of the town was considered of vital importance. Accordingly, it underwent two sieges, the first by William III. in person, which failed; and the second by General Ginkle, who, in the face of the Irish, forded the river, and took possession of the town, not losing more than fifty men in the attack. At present it is one of the principal depots for arms and military stores, and quarters a large garrison, upon the expenditure of which the town chiefly depends. Distant 55 miles west of Dublin. Long. 7. 50. W. Lat. 53. 20. N.
