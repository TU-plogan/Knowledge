AURELIANUS, Lucius Domitius, emperor of Rome, commanded the armies of the emperor Claudius with such glory, that after the death of that emperor all the legions agreed to place him on the throne. This happened in the year 270. He defeated the Goths, Samaritans, Marcomanni, the Persians, Egyptians, and Vandals, and conquered Zenobia queen of the Palmyrenians, and Tetricus general of the Gauls, both of whom were compelled to grace his triumph in the year 274. He was killed by one of his generals in Thrace in the year 276, when he was preparing to enter Persia with a great army.
