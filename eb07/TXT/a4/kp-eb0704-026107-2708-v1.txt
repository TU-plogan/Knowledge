AZOGA Ships were those Spanish ships commonly called the quicksilver ships, from their carrying quicksilver [7:4:262] to the Spanish West Indies, in order to extract the silver from the ore obtained in the mines of Mexico and Peru. These ships were not permitted to carry goods unless for the king of Spainâ€™s account.
