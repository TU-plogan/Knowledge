AURAe, in Mythology, a name given by the Romans to the nymphs of the air. They are mostly to be found in the ancient paintings of ceilings, where they are represented as light and airy, generally with long robes and flying veils of some lively colour or other, and fluttering about in the rare and pleasing element assigned to them. They are characterized as sportive and happy in themselves, and as well-wishers to mankind.
