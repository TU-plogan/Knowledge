AUGEAS, in fabulous history, was king of Elis, and particularly famed for his stable, which contained 3000 oxen, and had not been cleaned for thirty years. Hercules was desired to clear away the filth from this stable in one day; and Augeas promised, if he performed it, to give him a tenth part of the cattle. This task Hercules is said to have executed by turning the course of the river Alpheus through the stable; when Augeas refusing to stand by his engagement, Hercules slew him, and gave his kingdom to Phyleus his son, who had shown an abhorrence of his fatherâ€™s insincerity.
