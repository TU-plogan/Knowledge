ATTRUCK, a river of Persia, which has its rise in a branch of the Elburz Mountains that borders on the northern deserts of Khorassan. It collects the streams of an extensive valley, and of several subordinate glens, and conveys in a westerly direction to the desert a large body of water, which being joined by several other streams, falls into the Caspian Sea at Kooroo-Soofee, 40 or 50 miles to the north of Asterabad.
