AUGUR, an officer among the ancient Romans, appointed to foretell future events by the chattering, flight, and feeding of birds. There was a college or community of these functionaries, consisting originally of three members; afterwards the number was increased to nine, four of whom were patricians and five plebeians. They bore an augural staff or wand, as the ensign of their authority; and their dignity was so much respected that they were never deposed, nor any substituted in their place, even though convicted of the most enormous crimes.
