INTERPRETER, a person who explains the thoughts, words, or writings, of some other. The word interpres, according to Isidore, is composed of the preposition inter, aηΛ partes, as signifying a person in the middle between two parties, to make them mutually understand each other’s thoughts; whilst others derive it from inter, and prces, fidejussor, that is, a person who serves as security between two others who do not understand each other.

There have been many and keen debates about interpreting Scripture. The Catholics contend that it belongs absolutely to the church; adding, that where she is silent, reason may be consulted, but where she speaks, reason is to be disregarded. The Protestants generally allow reason to be the sovereign judge or interpreter, though some amongst them have a strong regard to synods, and others to the authority of the primitive fathers. Lastly, there are those who have recourse to the spirit within every person to interpret for them, which is whatBochart calls α<τoδs∕ξ∕ς roυ πviυμaτ(>ς.
