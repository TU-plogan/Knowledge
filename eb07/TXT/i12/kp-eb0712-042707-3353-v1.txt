IRKOUTSK, the capital of the above government and district, containing 1500 wooden houses, with two houses of stone. The streets are unpaved, though, owing to the fineness of the weather, they are seldom dirty. It contains thirty-three churches and two cloisters, and is also the seat of an archbishop, and the station of the officers of the government and a considerable body of troops. A seminary is maintained here by government, a popular school, and, since 1762, a school has been established for the Japanese language and navigation. An hospital was also established in 1772 for the small-pöx. Irkoutsk is also a commercial mart of considerable importance, and is the residence of many merchants engaged in the trade between Russia and China, which is carried on at Kiachta. It has in a good degree the aspect of a Chinese town, from the quantities of porcelain, enamelled and lacquered ware, and Chinese articles of dress and furniture, with which the houses are filled. Long. 103° 30 z E.; Lat. 52° 16 z N.
