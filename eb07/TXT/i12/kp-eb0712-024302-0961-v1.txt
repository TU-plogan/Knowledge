IDIOPATHY, in Physic, a disorder peculiar to a certain part of the body, and not arising from any preceding disease; in which sense it is opposed to sympathy. Thus, an epilepsy is idiopathic when it happens merely through some fault in the brain, and sympathetic when it is the consequence of some other disorder.

1DIOSYNCR ASY, amongst physicians, denotes a peculiar temperament of body, by which it is rendered more liable to certain disorders than persons of a different constitution usually are.
