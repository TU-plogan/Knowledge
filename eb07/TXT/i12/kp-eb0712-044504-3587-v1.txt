IRREGULAR, something that deviates from the common forms or rules. Thus we say, an irregular fortification, an irregular building, an irregular figure, and the like.

Irregular, in Grammar, such inflections of words as vary from the general rules. Thus we say, irregular nouns, irregular verbs, and the like. The distinction of irregular nouns, according to Mr Ruddiman, is into three kinds, viz. variable, defective, and abundant; and that of irregular verbs into anomalous, defective, and abundant.
