IMAGE, in Optics, a figure in the form of any object, made by the rays of light issuing from the several points of it, and meeting in so many other points, either at the bottom of the eye, or on any other ground, or on any transparent medium, where there is no surface to reflect them. Thus we are said to see all objects by means of their images formed in the eye.
