ISLEBIANS, in ecclesiastical history, a name given to those who adopted the sentiments of a Lutheran divine of Saxony, called John Agricola, a disciple of Luther, and a native of Isleb, who, interpreting literally some of the precepts of St Paul regarding the Jewish law, declaimed against the necessity of good works. See Antinomians.
