INOA, festivals in memory of Ino, celebrated yearly with sports and sacrifices at Corinth. An anniversary sacrifice was also offered to Ino at Megara, where she was first worshipped under the name of Leucothoe. Another festival of the same description was also celebrated in Laconia, in honour of the same goddess.
