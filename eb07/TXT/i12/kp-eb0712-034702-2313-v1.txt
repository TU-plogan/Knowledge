IONIUM Mare, a part of the Mediterranean Sea, at the bottom of the Adriatic. It lies between Sicily and Greece. That part of the Aegean Sea which lies on the coasts of Ionia in Asia is called the Sea of Ionia, and not the Ionian Sea. According to some authors, the Ionian Sea receives its name from Io, who swam across after she had been metamorphosed into a heifer.
