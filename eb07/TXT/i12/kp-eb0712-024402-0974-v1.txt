IDSTEIN, a bailiwick of the principality of Nassau, in Germany. It extends over about 82,000 acres, and contains 13,500 inhabitants, of whom about 7000 are Catholics and 6000 Lutherans, with a few Menonites, and some Jews. It contains two cities and twenty-nine villages. The capital is a small city of the same name. It stands at the foot of a mountain, and is surrounded with walls. The inhabitants amount to 1860, employed in curing leather, and other trades. Near to it is the palace of Gassen-bach, belonging to the sovereign; and around it his experimental farm, on which are large flocks of Merino sheep.
