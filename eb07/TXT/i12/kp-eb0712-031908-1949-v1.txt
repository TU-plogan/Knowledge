INTENTION, in Physics, the increase of the power or energy of any quality, as heat or cold, by which it stands opposed to remission, which signifies its decrease or diminution. *.

Intention, in Metaphysics, denotes an exertion of the intellectual faculties with more than ordinary vigour, when the mind earnestly fixes its view on any idea, considers it on all sides, and cannot be called off by any solicitation.
