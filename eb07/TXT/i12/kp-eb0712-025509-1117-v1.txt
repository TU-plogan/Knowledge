IMPRECATION (derived fromm, and precor, I pray), a curse or wish that some evil may befall any one.

The ancients had their goddesses, called in Latin Diroe, that is, Deorum iroe, who were supposed to be the executioners of evil consciences. They were called Diroe in heaven, Furies on earth, and Eumenides in hell. The Romans owned but three of these, and the Greeks only two. They invoked them with prayers and pieces of verses to destroy their enemies.
