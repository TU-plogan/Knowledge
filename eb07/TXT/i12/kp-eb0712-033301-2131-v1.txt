INVERBERVIE, or Bervie, a town of Scotland, in Kincardineshire, and a royal burgh in virtue of a charter of David II. dated 1362, and renewed by James VI. in 1595. It is situated on the sea-coast, at the mouth of a stream called Bervie, between two small hills, which terminate in high cliffs towards the sea, at thirteen miles distance north-east from Montrose. The first machine for spinning flax in Scotland was erected at Bervie, which still carries on this manufacture to Ã¡n inconsiderable extent. It unites with Montrose, Arbroath, Brechin, and Forfar, in returning a member to parliament. In 1831 the population amounted to 1137.
