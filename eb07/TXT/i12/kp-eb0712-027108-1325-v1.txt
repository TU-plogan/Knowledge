INFERIAe, sacrifices offered by the Romans to the DU Manes, or the souls of deceased heroes or other illustrious persons, or even any relation or person whose memory was held in veneration. These sacrifices consisted of honey, water, wine, milk, the blood of victims, a variety of balsamic unguents, chaplets, and loose flowers. The victims upon these occasions were generally of the smaller cattle, though in ancient times they sacrificed slaves or captives. The sacrifices were usually black and barren. The altars upon which they were offered were holes dug in the ground.

The honey, water, wine, milk, and blood, were used as libations, and were poured upon the tombs of children by children, upon those of virgins by virgins, and upon those of married men by women. The inferiae were offered on the ninth and thirtieth days after interment amongst the Greeks, and repeated in the month Anthesterion. The whole of this article applies equally to the Greeks and the Romans.
