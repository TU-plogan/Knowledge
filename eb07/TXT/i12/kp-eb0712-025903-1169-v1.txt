INCORRUPTIBLES, Incorruptibiles, the name of a sect which sprung out of the Eutychia≈âs. Their distinguishing tenet was, that the body of Jesus Christ was incorruptible; by which they meant, that after the time in which he was formed in the womb of his mother, he was not susceptible of any change or alteration, not even of any natural and innocent passions or appetites, so that he ate without any occasion, before his death, as well as after his resurrection. And hence it was that they took their name.
