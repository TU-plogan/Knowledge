ILIUM, or Ilion, in Ancient Geography, a name for the city of Troy, but most commonly used by the poets, and distinguished by the epithet Vetus, ancient. According to Strabo, the ancient city was thirty stadia farther east than New Ilium. The position of the latter is, according to Dr Clarke, upon a low eminence, about three miles from the promontory Sigeum, now called Jenitchere. New or modern Ilium was a village which Alexander, after the battle of Granicus, called a city, and ordered to be enlarged. It was afterwards adorned by the Romans, who granted it immunities as their mother city. The various disasters of the Greeks and Trojans, as described by Homer, gave rise to the proverb Enas Malorum.
