ISELASTICS, a kind of games, or combats, celebrated in Greece and Asia, in the time of the Roman emperors. The victors at these games had very considerable privileges conferred on them. They were crowned on the spot immediately after their victory, had pensions allowed them, were furnished with provisions at the public cost, and were carried in triumph to their own country.
