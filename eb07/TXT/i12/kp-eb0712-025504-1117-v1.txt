IMPERIAL, something belonging to an emperor, or empire. See Emperor, and Empire. Imperial Cities, in Germany, were those which owned no other head but the emperor. These were a kind of little commonwealths, the chief magistrates of which did homage to the emperor; but in other respects, and in the administration of justice, they are sovereign. There were formerly a great many such cities; but since 1815 there are only four, Hamburg, Bremen, Lubec, and Frankfort.

Imperial Diet, is an assembly or convention of all the states of the empire. See Germany, and Diet.
