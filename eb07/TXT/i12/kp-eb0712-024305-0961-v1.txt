IDOL, in pagan mythology, an image or fancied representation of any of the heathen gods. This image, of whatsoever materials it might consist, was, by certain ceremonies called consecration, converted into a god; but whilst under the artificerâ€™s hand, it was only a mere statue. Three things were necessary to turn it into a god; proper ornaments, consecration, and oration. The ornaments were various, and wholly designed to blind the eyes of the ignorant and stupid multitude. Then followed the consecration and oration, which were performed with great solemnity amongst the Romans. See Image.
