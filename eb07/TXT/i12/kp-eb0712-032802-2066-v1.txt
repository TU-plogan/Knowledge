INTERIM, a name given to a formulary, or kind of confession, of the articles of faith, obtruded upon the Protestants after Lutherâ€™s death by the Emperor Charles V. when he had defeated their forces; and so called because it was only to take place in the interim (mean time), till a general council should have decided all points in dispute between the Protestants and Catholics. It retained most of the doctrines and ceremonies of the Catholics, excepting that of marriage, which was allowed to the clergy, and communion to the laity under both kinds. Most of the Protestants rejected it. There were two interims besides this; the one of Leipsic, and the other of Franconia.
