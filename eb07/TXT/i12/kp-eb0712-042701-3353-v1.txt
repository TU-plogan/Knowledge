IRELAND, New, an island in the eastern seas, north from New Britain. It is long and narrow, and extends from north-west to south-east about 190 miles. Its aspect from the sea is very mountainous, and appears to be covered with thick woods, which abound in pigeons, parrots, and other birds. The inhabitants are in a state of barbarity, black and woolly headed like negroes; but without the flat nose and thick lips. Their canoes are very long and narrow; one of them, that was formed of a single tree, was not less than ninety feel in length. It is situated between Long. 150째 30 z and 153째 5' E. and Lat. 33째 40 z and 50째 S.
