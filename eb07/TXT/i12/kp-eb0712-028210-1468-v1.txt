INO, in fabulous history, a daughter of Cadmus and Harmonia, who nursed Bacchus. She married Athamas, king of Thebes, after he had divorced Nephele, by whom he had two children, Phryxus and Helle. Ino became mother of Melicerta and Learchus; and soon conceived an implacable hatred against the children of Nephele, because they were to ascend the throne in preference to her own. Phryxus and Helle were informed of Ino’s machinations, and escaped to Colchis on a golden ram. Juno, jealous of Ino’s prosperity, resolved to disturb her peace; and more particularly because she was a descendant of her greatest enemy Venus. Tisiphone being sent by order of Juno to the house of Athamas, she filled the whole palace with such fury, that Athamas, taking Ino to be a lioness and her children whelps, pursued her and dashed her son Learchus against a wall. Ino escaped the fury of her husband, and from a high rock threw herself into the sea, with Melicerta in her arms. The gods pitied her fate; and Neptune transformed her into a sea deity, afterwards denominated Leucothoe. Melicerta also became a sea god, and was known by the name of Palemon.
