ILLYRIUS, Mathias, Flaccus, or Francowitz, one of the most learned divines of the Augsburg confession, born in Istria, anciently called Illyria, in 1520. He is said to have been a man of considerable genius, extensive learning, and of great zeal against popery; but he was of a restless and passionate temper, which overbalanced all his good qualities, and occasioned much disturbance in the Protestant church. He published a great number of books, and died in 1575.

1LMINSTER, a town of the county of Somerset, in the hundred of Abdick, 135 miles from London. It stands in a fertile district, and has a market, which is held on Saturday. There was formerly a considerable manufacture of woollens, but it has declined, and of late years has been in some measure replaced by mills for making lace net. There is a large church, formerly conventual, and an excellently endowed grammar-school. The population amounted in 1801 to 2045, in 1811 to 2160, in 1821 to 2156, and in 1831 to 2957.
