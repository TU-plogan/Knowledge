                <p><label type="entry">YONNE</label>, a department in the north-east of France,
                    formed out of Auxerois in the ancient Burgundy, and Sennois, a part of ancient
                    Champagne. It extends in north latitude from 47° 22' to 48° 37', and in east
                    longitude from 2° 47' to 4° 19'. It is bounded on the north by the departments
                    of Seine-Marne and Aube, on the east by Aube and Côte d’Or, on the south by
                    Nievre, and on the west by Loiret. It is 2846 square miles in extent, is divided
                    into five arrondissements, thirty-seven cantons, and 481 communes, containing
                    355,237 inhabitants in 1836, all of whom adhere to the Roman Catholic church.
                    The face of the country is undulating, with valleys extending between hills of
                    moderate height. In the western division, the soil chiefly consists of clay,
                    which is much covered with wood, and overrun with wet marshy pools and ditches.
                    In the south and east it is calcareous and stony, and in the north a productive
                    loam. It is on the whole tolerably fertile, yielding more corn than is required
                    for the consumption of the inhabitants. The climate is mild and peculiarly
                    healthy. The chief river, from which the department takes the name, is
                    navigable. It enters from Nievre, flowing from south to north; and after
                    receiving the waters of the Vannes, the Armoncon, the Seray, the Eure, the
                    Voisin, and the Tholon, it passes into the department of the Seine and Marne.
                    The canal of Burgundy terminates near to St Florentin, and the canal of Briare
                    touches a small part of this division of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The chief occupation is agriculture, and the corn grown here is of a good
                    quality, especially in the northern part; but in the east and the south the
                    cultivation of the vine is found a more beneficial pursuit. A large quantity of
                    excellent wine is made, especially in the district adjoining to Côte d’Or. There
                    is nothing remarkable in either their cows or sheep; and the cultivation of
                    green crops is very rarely attended to, the only good pasture being the natural
                    meadows on the banks of the Yonne. Fruit trees are very abundant, and yield
                    large annual crops, especially of plums; and the nuts and chestnuts are objects
                    for export. The other articles exported are wood, charcoal, wine, hay, and live
                    cattle. There are manufactures of cotton, linen, and woollen; paper-mills,
                    tanneries, glass-houses, and potteries; but barely sufficient for the home
                    demand, and all upon a contracted scale. There are some small mines of iron, not
                    yielding more than 300 tons of raw iron, which does not suffice for the supply.
                    This department elects three deputies to the representative chamber.</p>
