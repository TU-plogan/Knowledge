                    miles, it falls into the Yellow Sea by numerous channels, in about 33° north
                    latitude. In the early part of its course it runs northward, and is carried
                    beyond the limits of the Chinese empire, being turned aside by a lofty chain of
                    mountains for 500 or 600 miles. It afterwards turns into an opposite direction,
                    and reaching the original line of its course, again enters the Chinese empire,
                    and by its winding progress diffuses more widely the benefit of its waters.
                    Though broad and rapid, it is in many places so shallow as to be unfavourable
                    for navigation. It is also liable to overflow its banks, so that it has been
                    necessary to raise dikes for the defence of the surrounding country.</p>
