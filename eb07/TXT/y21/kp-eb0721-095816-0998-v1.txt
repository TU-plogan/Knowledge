YARM, or Yarum, a market-town of the north riding of Yorkshire, in the wapentake of Langbarough, 244 miles from London. It stands on the river Tees, over which is a handsome bridge, and consists of one long wide street. It has a considerable trade by sea, and much corn and lead are shipped for London. There were in ancient times two monasteries, founded by the family of Bruce. It has a good market on Thursday. The population amounted in 1821 to 1504, and in 1831 to 1636.
