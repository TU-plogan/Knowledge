YAYNANGHEOM, a town of the Birman empire, situated on the eastern bank of the Irrawuddy river. It carries on a very considerable traffic, and has a manufacture of earthen ware. Five miles east of the town are situated the petroleum wells, which supply the whole kingdom with this oil, which is used in lamps and for all other purposes of train or wood oil, and is sold very cheap. The government farms out the ground that supplies this extraordinary oil, and the renter draws it out at his own expense. The depth of the pits is about thirty-seven fathoms, and it is drawn out by means of pots, which are let down to the bottom by ropes. Long. 94. 35. E. Lat. 20. 28. N.
