ANTIOCHIAN Sect or Academy, a name given to what was called the fifth academy. It took the denomination from its being founded by Antiochus, a philosopher contemporary with Cicero. The Antiochian academy succeeded the Philonian. As to doctrine, the philosophers of this sect appear to have restored that of the ancient academy, except in the article of the criterion of truth. Antiochus was really a Stoic, and only nominally an Academic.

ANTiociHAĩĩ Epocha, a method of computing time from the proclamation of liberty granted to the city of Antioch about the time of the battle of Pharsalia.
