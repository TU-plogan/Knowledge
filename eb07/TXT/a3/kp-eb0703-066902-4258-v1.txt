ASHBOURN, a market-town in the hundred of Wirksworth, and county of Derby. It is 139 miles from London, on the high road to the north-west part of the island. It stands on the small beautiful river Dove, by which [7:3:670] stream some mills for spinning cotton are turned. There is a good corn market held every Saturday. The population was, in 1801, 2006; in 1811, 2112; and in 1821, 2188; but the parish of Ashbourn is more extensive than the town, and at the last census contained 4708 inhabitants.
