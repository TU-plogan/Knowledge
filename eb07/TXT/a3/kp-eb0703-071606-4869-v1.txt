ASSIDEANS, or Chasidaeans (from the Hebrew chasidim, merciful, pious), those Jews who resorted to .Mattathias to fight for the law of God and the liberties of their country. They were men of great valour and zeal, having voluntarily devoted themselves to a more strict observance of the law than other men; for after the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity there were two sorts of men in their church,—those who contented themselves with that obedience only which was prescribed by the law of Moses, and who were called Zadikim, i. e. the righteous, — and those who, over and above the law, superadded the constitutions and traditions of the elders, and other rigorous observances: these latter were called Chasidim, i. e. the pious. From the former sprung the

Samaritans, Sadducees, and Caraites; from the latter the Pharisees and the Essenes.
