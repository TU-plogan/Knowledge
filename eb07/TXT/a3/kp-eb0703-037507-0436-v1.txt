ARBELA, now Irbil, a city of Assyria, lying in long. 44. 5. E. lat. 35. 15. N. It is famous for the last and decisive battle fought in its neighbourhood between Alexander the Great and Darius Codomannus. This battle was fought 331 years before Christ, and determined the fate of the Persian empire. Arrian relates, that Darius’s army consisted of a million of foot and 40,000 horse; according to Diodorus, there were 200,000 horse and 800,000 foot; Plutarch relates that the horse and foot together made up a million; and Justin gives us exactly half Diodorus’s number. The Macedonian army, according to Arrian, consisted of 40,000 foot and 7000 horse. “With the loss of 500 men,” says Dr Gillies, “Alexander destroyed 40,000 of the barbarians, who never thenceforth assembled in sufficient numbers to dispute his dominion in the East. The invaluable provinces of Babylonia, Susiana, and Persis, with their respective capitals of Babylon, Susa, and Persepolis, formed the prize of his skill and valour. The gold and silver found in those cities amounted to thirty millions sterling; the jewels and other precious spoil belonging to Darius sufficed, according to Plutarch, to load 20,000 mules and 5000 camels.” (Gillies’s History of Greece.)
