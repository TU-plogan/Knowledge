ARBACES governed Media under Sardanapalus. Seeing him spinning among a company of his women, he stirred up his people to revolt, and dethroned Sardanapalus, who thereupon burnt himself in his palace. Arbaces being crowned, began the monarchy of the Medes, which lasted 317 years under nine kings, till Astyages was expelled by Cyrus. Arbaces reigned 22 years, and died a. Î¼. 3206.
