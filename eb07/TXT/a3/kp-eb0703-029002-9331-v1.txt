APOLLYON, a Greek word that signifies the destroys and answers to the Hebrew Αbαddoη. St John in the Revelation (ix. 11) says that an angel having opened the bottomless pit, a thick smoke issued out of it, and with this smoke locusts, like horses prepared for battle, and commanded by the angel of the bottomless pit, called in Hebrew Abaddon, but in Greek Apollyrn.
[7:3:291]
