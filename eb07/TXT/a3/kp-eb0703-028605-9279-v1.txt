APOGEE, in Astronomy, that point in the orbit of a planet which is at the greatest distance from the earth. The apogee of the sun is that part of the earth’s orbit which is at the greatest distance from the sun; and, consequently, the sun’s apogee and the earth’s aphelion are one and the same point.
