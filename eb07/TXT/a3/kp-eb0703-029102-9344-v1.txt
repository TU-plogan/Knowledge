APOMYOS Deus (cwro, and μ∙xa,fly), in the Heathen Mythology, a name under which Jupiter was worshipped at Elis, and Hercules as well as Jupiter at the Olympic games. These deities were supplicated under this name to destroy or drive away the vast number of flies which always attended at the great sacrifices; and in those which accompanied the Olympic games, the first was always to the Apomyos, or Myiagrus Deus, that he might drive away the flies from the rest. The usual sacrifice was a bull.
