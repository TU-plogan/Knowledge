ANNUNCIADA, Annuntiada, or Annunciata, an order of knighthood in Savoy, first instituted by Amadeus I. in the year 1409. Their collar was of 15 links, interwoven one with another, in form of a true lover’s knot; and the motto F. E. R. T., signifying Fortitudo ejus Rho-dum tenuit. Amadeus VIII. gave the name Annunciada to this order·, which was formerly known by that of the knot of love; changing at the same time the image of St Maurice, patron of Savoy, which hung at the collar, for that of the Virgin Mary; and, instead of the motto· above mentioned, substituting the words of the angel’s salutation.
