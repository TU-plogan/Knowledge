ARMATURA, in a general sense, is the same with what we otherwise call armour. It is more particularly used in the ancient military art to denote a kind of exercise performed with missile weapons, as darts, spears, arrows, and the like. In this sense armatura stands contradistinguished from palaria; the latter being the exercise of the heavy-armed, the former of the light-armed.
