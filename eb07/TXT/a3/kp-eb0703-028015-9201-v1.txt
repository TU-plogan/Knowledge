APAULIA, in Antiquity, the third day of a marriage solemnity. It was thus called because the bride, returning to her father’s house, did αwαuλ∕ζetfdα∕ τoυ νυμφίου, lodge apart from the bridegroom. Some will have the apaulia to have been the second day of the marriage, viz. that whereon the chief ceremony was performed; thus called by way of contradistinction from the first day, which was called wgoαuλ∕α∙ On the day called aοraυλιοο (whenever that was), the bride presented her bridegroom with a garment called απαυΤτ/τηρα.
