APOCOPE, among grammarians, a figure which cuts off a letter or syllable from the end of a word; as ingem t for ingenii. « .

- APOCRISARIUS, in Ecclesiastical PŖstory, a sort of resident in an imperial city, in the name of a foreign churoh or bishop, whose office was to negotiate, as proctor at the emperor’s court, in all ecclesiastical causes in whicl his principals might be concerned. The institution of the office seems to have taken place in the time of Constantine, or not long after, when, the emperors having become Christians, foreign churches had more occasion to promote their suits at court than formerly. However, we find it established by law in the time of Justinian. In imitation of this officer, almost every monastery had its Apocrisarius, or resident, in the imperial city. The title and quality of apocrisary became at length appropriated to the pope’s agent, or nuncio as he is now called, who resided at Constantinople to receive the pope’s dispatches and the emperor’s answers. The word is formed from affoxg/røy, to answer.
