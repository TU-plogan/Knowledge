APOSTROPHE, in Rhetoric, a figure by which a person who is either absent or dead is addressed as if he were present and attentive to us. This figure is, in bold-* ness, a degree lower than the addresses to personified objects (see Personification), since it requires a less effort of imagination to suppose persons present who are dead or absent, than to imitate insensible beings and direct our discourse to them.

Apostrophe, in Grammar, the contraction of a word by the use of a comma; as call’d for called, tlιd for though.
