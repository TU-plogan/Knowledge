APHTHARTODOCETAe, a sect, sworn enemies of the council of Chalcedon. The word is derived from αpdαjroj, incorruptible, and ⅛x≡ω, I imagine; and was given them because they imagined that the body of Jesus Christ was incorruptible and impassible, and not capable of death, They arose among the Eutychians, and made their appearance in the year 535.
