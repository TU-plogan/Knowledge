ARDSISCH, or Argisch, a circle in the province of Wallachia, now comprehending within it the circle of Lowwishta. It lies to the south of the Carpathian Mountains, through which, by the pass of Rothe Thurm, there is a way into Hungary. The circle contains two cities, two market-towns, and 202 villages and hamlets. The chief city, Ardisch, which was once the seat of the governors of the country, is fast decaying; but it still contains six churches, a large and beautiful monastery, and the ruins of the ancient palace of âˆ™ the sovereigns.
