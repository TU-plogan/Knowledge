APOSTOLIANS, a sect of the Mennonites, which first sprung up in the year 1663, and derived its name from Apostool, one of the Mennonite ministers at Amsterdam. They concurred with them in doctrine, and admitted to their communion those only who professed to believe all the sentiments which are contained in their public confession of faith.
