ARGIMNA, a town of Armenia, in the pachalic of Diarbckir, on the head waters of the Tigris, 40 miles north-west from Diarbekir. It is situated on a lofty mountain, and such is the declivity of the ground, that the houses appear to be piled one above another; and in winter the torrents rush down the streets with such violence as to render them impassable. The town is populous, but wretchedly built, and is remarkable for the quantity of wine and brandy made in its vicinity.
