It belongs to the duchy of Sleswick, and came definitively to the crown of Denmark in the year 1749. Firewood is scarce, as every spot of ground is under tillage. The horses and black cattle are in good condition. Agriculture, navigation, and fishing, are the chief sources of income. Population above 4500. Long. 10. 20. E. Lat. 54. 53. N.
