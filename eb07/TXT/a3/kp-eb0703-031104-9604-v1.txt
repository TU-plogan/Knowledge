APPROVER, in Law, one who, professing felony in himself, appealeth or impeacheth another or more of his accomplices. He is so called from the French approuver, comprobare, because he must prove what he hath alleged in his appeal. This proof was anciently either by battle or by the country, at the choice of the appellee, and the form of this accusation may be found in Crompt. Just. 250.
