ANJAR, a fortified town of Hindostan, and capital of a district of the same name, in the province of Cutch, whieh was eeded to the British government in 1816. The country is dry and sandy, and depends entirely on irrigation by means of wells, the expense of sinking which is great. ThÃ« town is situated nearly 10 miles from the gulf of Cutch. In 1816 it surrendered to the British. It suffered severely from an earthquake in 1819, about 3000 houses being either destroyed or rendered uninhabitable, and 165 persons having lost their lives; while the other half of the town, situated on low rocky ridges, suffered comparatively nothing. In 1820 the population was estimated at 10,000. The port named Toonea is fronted by a creek from the gulf. Long. 70. 11. E. Lat. 23. 3. N.
