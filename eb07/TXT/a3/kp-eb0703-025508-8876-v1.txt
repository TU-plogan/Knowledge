ANTIQUE, in a general sense, something that is ancient: but the term is chiefly used by sculptors, painters, and architects, to denote such pieces of their different arts as were made by the ancient Greeks and Romans. Thus we say, an antique bust, an antique statue, &c.

Antique is something contradistinguished from ancient, which signifies a less degree of antiquity. Thus antique architecture is frequently distinguished from ancient architecture. ,
