#### Release Notes
4-Oct-22. We're very excited to publish first version of plain text for this edition! Some notes on v1.0:

1. **Tables** are out of scope for the version. Their location is indicated in the text with *[table]*.
2. **Page breaks** are indicated inline as *[edition:volume:page]*.
3. **Notes** are included inline at the point of the siglum, and signified as *^[1. This is note text.]* 
4. **Files** Entries are in individual TXT files with a header for the Knowledge Project.
5. **ZIP file** To easily download the complete edition, use the ZIP file.
6. **Directories** Files are organized in directories named for the letter of the entry + the volume number of the print edition. So 'j12' contains all entries in volume 12 beginning with the letter 'j'.
7. **File names** File naming explanation, _kp-eb0710-022203-6853-v1.txt_
