#### Notes
4-Oct-22. We're very excited to publish first version of plain text for this edition! Some notes on this release:
* Entries are in individual TXT files with a header for the Knowledge Project. Licensing is CC-BY.
* To easily download the complete edition, please use the ZIP file.
* Files are organized in directories named for the letter of the entry + the volume number of the print edition. So 'j12' contains all entries in volume 12 beginning with the letter 'j'.
* File naming explanation, _kp-eb0710-022203-6853-v1.txt_
    * _kp_ = Knowledge Project
    * _eb0710_ = 7th ed., vol. 10
    * _022203_ = page 222, 3rd entry on the page
    * _6853_ = last 4 digits of the source image filename (makes filenames unique)
    * _v1_ = version 1.0
